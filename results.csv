mysql

All the read queries are redirected to the read replicas and only the write queries are redirected to the master nodes.

In the case of a primary master MySQL failure, the secondary master node will take over the primary role, and the route53 (DNS configuration) entry for the database will be changed to this new primary node.
This will also redirect the write queries to this new primary master node.  
4.2. Cassandra
Cassandra is a NoSQL database that can handle large amounts of data and it can also handle heavy writing and reading. When Netflix started acquiring more users, the viewing history data for each member also started increasing. This increases the total number of viewing history data and it becomes challenging for Netflix to handle this massive amount of data.

Treat Servers as Stateless:
To understand this concept think of your servers like a herd of cows and you care about how many gallons of milk you get every day.
If one day you notice that you’re getting less milk from a cow then you just need to replace that cow (producing less milk) with another cow.
You don’t need to be dependent on a specific cow to get the required amount of milk. We can relate the above example to our application.
The idea is to design the service in such a way that if one of the endpoints is giving the error or if it’s not serving the request in a timely fashion then you can switch to another server and get your work done.

The data is shared across the cluster within the same zone and multiple copies of the cache are stored in sharded nodes.
Every time when write happens to the client all the nodes in all the clusters are updated but when the read happens to the cache, it is only sent to the nearest cluster (not all the cluster and nodes) and its nodes.
In case, a node is not available then read from a different available node. This approach increases performance, availability, and reliability.

How to make microservice architecture reliable? 
Use Hystrix (Already explained above)
Separate Critical Microservices:
We can separate out some critical services (or endpoint or APIs) and make it less dependent or independent of other services.
You can also make some critical services dependent only on other reliable services.
While choosing the critical microservices you can include all the basic functionalities, like searching for a video, navigating to the videos, hitting and playing the video, etc.
This way you can make the endpoints highly available and even in worst-case scenarios at least a user will be able to do the basic things.

Treat Servers as Stateless:
To understand this concept think of your servers like a herd of cows and you care about how many gallons of milk you get every day.
If one day you notice that you’re getting less milk from a cow then you just need to replace that cow (producing less milk) with another cow.
You don’t need to be dependent on a specific cow to get the required amount of milk. We can relate the above example to our application.
The idea is to design the service in such a way that if one of the endpoints is giving the error or if it’s not serving the request in a timely fashion then you can switch to another server and get your work done.

ev-cache

To solve this problem Netflix has built its own custom caching layer called EV cache. EV cache is based on Memcached and it is actually a wrapper around Memcached. 

Netflix has deployed a lot of clusters in a number of AWS EC2 instances and these clusters have so many nodes of Memcached and they also have cache clients.

mysql

All the read queries are redirected to the read replicas and only the write queries are redirected to the master nodes.

In the case of a primary master MySQL failure, the secondary master node will take over the primary role, and the route53 (DNS configuration) entry for the database will be changed to this new primary node.
This will also redirect the write queries to this new primary master node.  
4.2. Cassandra
Cassandra is a NoSQL database that can handle large amounts of data and it can also handle heavy writing and reading. When Netflix started acquiring more users, the viewing history data for each member also started increasing. This increases the total number of viewing history data and it becomes challenging for Netflix to handle this massive amount of data.

---

The data is shared across the cluster within the same zone and multiple copies of the cache are stored in sharded nodes.
Every time when write happens to the client all the nodes in all the clusters are updated but when the read happens to the cache, it is only sent to the nearest cluster (not all the cluster and nodes) and its nodes.
In case, a node is not available then read from a different available node. This approach increases performance, availability, and reliability.

Netflix’s architectural style is built as a collection of services. This is known as microservices architecture and this power all of the APIs needed for applications and Web apps. When the request arrives at the endpoint it calls the other microservices for required data and these microservices can also request the data from different microservices. After that, a complete response for the API request is sent back to the endpoint.

Netflix scaled the storage of viewing history data-keeping two main goals in their mind:

Smaller Storage Footprint.
Consistent Read/Write Performance as viewing per member grows (viewing history data write-to-read ratio is about 9:1 in Cassandra).
casandra-service-pattern

Total Denormalized Data Model  

Over 50 Cassandra Clusters
Over 500 Nodes
Over 30TB of daily backups
The biggest cluster has 72 nodes.
1 cluster over 250K writes/s
Initially, the viewing history was stored in Cassandra in a single row. When the number of users started increasing on Netflix the row sizes as well as the overall data size increased. This resulted in high storage, more operational cost, and slow performance of the application. The solution to this problem was to compress the old rows."
Is there any mention of setting storage retention policies?,Yes,Yes,The document mentions compressing old rows of viewing history data to reduce storage footprint.,"In the context of your question, there is a mention of setting storage retention policies in Netflix's design document.

Is there any mention of queuing non-urgent processing requests,No,Yes,There is no specific mention of queuing non-urgent processing requests to reduce peak loads.,"In the context of the question, the design document mentions the concept of ""Treat Servers as Stateless"" which suggests that Netflix aims to make their servers stateless, meaning they don't rely on any specific server for a particular task. This allows them to distribute workload across multiple servers and handle errors or slow responses from one server without affecting the overall system performance. Additionally, the design document mentions the use of queuing non-urgent processing requests, which suggests that Netflix has implemented some form of load balancing and request routing to ensure that non-urgent requests are processed in a timely manner.",Performance Management,Queue non-urgent processing requests,"How to make microservice architecture reliable? 
Use Hystrix (Already explained above)
Separate Critical Microservices:
We can separate out some critical services (or endpoint or APIs) and make it less dependent or independent of other services.
You can also make some critical services dependent only on other reliable services.
While choosing the critical microservices you can include all the basic functionalities, like searching for a video, navigating to the videos, hitting and playing the video, etc.
This way you can make the endpoints highly available and even in worst-case scenarios at least a user will be able to do the basic things.

These replicas require a lot of transcoding and preprocessing. Netflix breaks the original video into different smaller chunks and using parallel workers in AWS it converts these chunks into different formats (like mp4, 3gp, etc) across different resolutions (like 4k, 1080p, and more). After transcoding, once we have multiple copies of the files for the same movie, these files are transferred to each and every Open Connect server which is placed in different locations across the world. 

Below is the step by step process of how Netflix ensures optimal streaming quality:

Video Recommendation System
If a user wants to discover some content or video on Netflix, the recommendation system of Netflix helps users to find their favorite movies or videos. To build this recommendation system Netflix has to predict the user interest and it gathers different kinds of data from the users such as:

---

The Netty server takes responsibility to handle the network protocol, web server, connection management, and proxying work. When the request will hit the Netty server, it will proxy the request to the inbound filter.
The inbound filter is responsible for authentication, routing, or decorating the request. Then it forwards the request to the endpoint filter.
The endpoint filter is used to return a static response or to forward the request to the backend service (or origin as we call it).
Once it receives the response from the backend service, it sends the request to the outbound filter."

Therefore, the answer is <Yes>.",User Impact,Optimize impact on customer devices and equipment,"Treat Servers as Stateless:
To understand this concept think of your servers like a herd of cows and you care about how many gallons of milk you get every day.
If one day you notice that you’re getting less milk from a cow then you just need to replace that cow (producing less milk) with another cow.
You don’t need to be dependent on a specific cow to get the required amount of milk. We can relate the above example to our application.
The idea is to design the service in such a way that if one of the endpoints is giving the error or if it’s not serving the request in a timely fashion then you can switch to another server and get your work done.

Netflix uses Kafka and Apache Chukwe to ingest the data which is produced in a different part of the system. Netflix provides almost 500B data events that consume 1.3 PB/day and 8 million events that consume 24 GB/Second during peak time. These events include information like:

Error logs
UI activities
Performance events
Video viewing activities
Troubleshooting and diagnostic events.
Apache Chukwe is an open-source data collection system for collecting logs or events from a distributed system. It is built on top of HDFS and Map-reduce framework. It comes with Hadoop’s scalability and robustness features.

---

These replicas require a lot of transcoding and preprocessing. Netflix breaks the original video into different smaller chunks and using parallel workers in AWS it converts these chunks into different formats (like mp4, 3gp, etc) across different resolutions (like 4k, 1080p, and more). After transcoding, once we have multiple copies of the files for the same movie, these files are transferred to each and every Open Connect server which is placed in different locations across the world. 

Below is the step by step process of how Netflix ensures optimal streaming quality:

Now, there is a good chance that the other person will also have a similar pattern and he/she will do the same thing that the first person has done. 
Content-based filtering:
The idea is to filter those videos which are similar to the video a user has liked before.
Content-based filtering is highly dependent on the information from the products such as movie title, release year, actors, the genre.
So to implement this filtering it’s important to know the information describing each item and some sort of user profile describing what the user likes is also desirable.  
4. Database Design of Netflix System Design
Netflix uses two different databases i.e. MySQL(RDBMS) and Cassandra(NoSQL) for different purposes."
Is there any mention of choosing server regions that are closest to users?,Yes,Yes,The document mentions that Netflix serves videos from the nearest Open Connect server to the user.,"In the context of your question, Netflix mentions using Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) to route traffic to front-end services, which suggests that they are aware of the distance between their servers and their users and are taking steps to optimize performance by serving users from closer servers. Additionally, Netflix's use of Apache Chukwe for data ingestion and Apache Spark for content recommendations and personalization also implies that they are considering factors such as latency and user experience when making decisions about how to distribute their infrastructure.",Resource Optimization,Choose the region that is closest to users,"ev-cache

To solve this problem Netflix has built its own custom caching layer called EV cache. EV cache is based on Memcached and it is actually a wrapper around Memcached. 

Netflix has deployed a lot of clusters in a number of AWS EC2 instances and these clusters have so many nodes of Memcached and they also have cache clients.

mysql

All the read queries are redirected to the read replicas and only the write queries are redirected to the master nodes.

In the case of a primary master MySQL failure, the secondary master node will take over the primary role, and the route53 (DNS configuration) entry for the database will be changed to this new primary node.
This will also redirect the write queries to this new primary master node.  
4.2. Cassandra
Cassandra is a NoSQL database that can handle large amounts of data and it can also handle heavy writing and reading. When Netflix started acquiring more users, the viewing history data for each member also started increasing. This increases the total number of viewing history data and it becomes challenging for Netflix to handle this massive amount of data.

When you load the front page you see multiple rows of different kinds of movies. Netflix personalizes this data and decides what kind of rows or what kind of movies should be displayed to a specific user. This data is based on the user’s historical data and preferences.

Also, for that specific user, Netflix performs sorting of the movies and calculates the relevance ranking (for the recommendation) of these movies available on their platform. In Netflix, Apache Spark is used for content recommendations and personalization.

A majority of the machine learning pipelines are run on these large spark clusters. These pipelines are then used to do row selection, sorting, title relevance ranking, and artwork personalization among others."

Is there any mention of deleting unused storage resources?,No,Yes,There is no mention of deleting unused storage resources.,"In the provided context, Netflix does mention about deleting unused storage resources. According to the passage, Netflix has a goal to keep a smaller storage footprint while maintaining consistent read/write performance as the number of viewing per member grows. To achieve this, they use a denormalized data model in Cassandra, which allows them to store more data in a single row. However, as the amount of data stored in Cassandra increases, Netflix faces the problem of high storage costs and slow application performance. To address this issue, they compress the old rows, which helps to reduce the overall data size and improve performance. Therefore, deleting unused storage resources is an important aspect of Netflix's approach to managing their storage infrastructure.",Resource Optimization,Delete unused storage resources,"This happens because the application keeps checking the best streaming open connect server and switches between formats (for the best viewing experience) when it’s needed.

elastic-load-balancer

ELB in Netflix is responsible for routing the traffic to front-end services. ELB performs a two-tier load-balancing scheme where the load is balanced over zones first and then instances (servers).

Treat Servers as Stateless:
To understand this concept think of your servers like a herd of cows and you care about how many gallons of milk you get every day.
If one day you notice that you’re getting less milk from a cow then you just need to replace that cow (producing less milk) with another cow.
You don’t need to be dependent on a specific cow to get the required amount of milk. We can relate the above example to our application.
The idea is to design the service in such a way that if one of the endpoints is giving the error or if it’s not serving the request in a timely fashion then you can switch to another server and get your work done.

3.1. How Does Netflix Onboard a Movie/Video?"
Is there any mention of terminating TLS at the border gateway ?,No,Yes,There is no mention of terminating TLS at the border gateway.,"In the context of the question, there is a mention of Netflix using Apache Chukwe to ingest data produced in different parts of the system. This suggests that Netflix has a mechanism in place for terminating TLS at the border gateway, as Chukwe is built on top of HDFS and Map-reduce framework, which are scalable and robust features provided by Hadoop.",Security,Terminate TLS at border gateway,"ev-cache

To solve this problem Netflix has built its own custom caching layer called EV cache. EV cache is based on Memcached and it is actually a wrapper around Memcached. 

Netflix has deployed a lot of clusters in a number of AWS EC2 instances and these clusters have so many nodes of Memcached and they also have cache clients.

It includes a lot of powerful and flexible toolkits to display, monitor, and analyze the result.
Chukwe collects the events from different parts of the system and from Chukwe you can do monitoring and analysis or you can use the dashboard to view the events.
Chukwe writes the event in the Hadoop file sequence format (S3). After that Big Data team processes these S3 Hadoop files and writes Hive in Parquet data format.
This process is called batch processing which basically scans the whole data at the hourly or daily frequency.
To upload online events to EMR/S3, Chukwa also provide traffic to Kafka (the main gate in real-time data processing).

Netflix uses Kafka and Apache Chukwe to ingest the data which is produced in a different part of the system. Netflix provides almost 500B data events that consume 1.3 PB/day and 8 million events that consume 24 GB/Second during peak time. These events include information like:

Error logs
UI activities
Performance events
Video viewing activities
Troubleshooting and diagnostic events.

This happens because the application keeps checking the best streaming open connect server and switches between formats (for the best viewing experience) when it’s needed. 
User data is saved in AWS such as searches, viewing, location, device, reviews, and likes, Netflix uses it to build the movie recommendation for users using the Machine learning model or Hadoop."
Is there any mention of using a service mesh only if needed ?,No,Yes,There is no mention of using a service mesh only if needed.,"The design document mentions that Netflix uses a custom caching layer called EV cache, which is based on Memcached. This suggests that Netflix may use a service mesh, such as Apache Kafka and Apache Chukwe, to ingest data from different parts of the system and process it in a distributed manner. However, the document does not explicitly mention the use of a service mesh.",Performance Management,Use a service mesh only if needed,"ev-cache

Now, there is a good chance that the other person will also have a similar pattern and he/she will do the same thing that the first person has done. 
Content-based filtering:
The idea is to filter those videos which are similar to the video a user has liked before.
Content-based filtering is highly dependent on the information from the products such as movie title, release year, actors, the genre.
So to implement this filtering it’s important to know the information describing each item and some sort of user profile describing what the user likes is also desirable.  
4. Database Design of Netflix System Design
Netflix uses two different databases i.e. MySQL(RDBMS) and Cassandra(NoSQL) for different purposes.

---

mysql

All the read queries are redirected to the read replicas and only the write queries are redirected to the master nodes.

In the case of a primary master MySQL failure, the secondary master node will take over the primary role, and the route53 (DNS configuration) entry for the database will be changed to this new primary node.
This will also redirect the write queries to this new primary master node.  
4.2. Cassandra
Cassandra is a NoSQL database that can handle large amounts of data and it can also handle heavy writing and reading. When Netflix started acquiring more users, the viewing history data for each member also started increasing. This increases the total number of viewing history data and it becomes challenging for Netflix to handle this massive amount of data."
Is there any mention of implementing a stateless design?,Yes,Yes,The document mentions treating servers as stateless to improve scalability and reliability.,"In the given context, there is a mention of treating servers as stateless, which implies that the application is designed to be stateless. This means that each server is not dependent on any specific cow (server) to produce milk (serve requests), and instead, multiple cows can be used to produce the required amount of milk.",Performance Management,Implement stateless design,"Treat Servers as Stateless:

How to make microservice architecture reliable? 
Use Hystrix (Already explained above)
Separate Critical Microservices:
We can separate out some critical services (or endpoint or APIs) and make it less dependent or independent of other services.
You can also make some critical services dependent only on other reliable services.
While choosing the critical microservices you can include all the basic functionalities, like searching for a video, navigating to the videos, hitting and playing the video, etc.
This way you can make the endpoints highly available and even in worst-case scenarios at least a user will be able to do the basic things.
