mysql

All the read queries are redirected to the read replicas and only the write queries are redirected to the master nodes.

In the case of a primary master MySQL failure, the secondary master node will take over the primary role, and the route53 (DNS configuration) entry for the database will be changed to this new primary node.
This will also redirect the write queries to this new primary master node.  
4.2. Cassandra
Cassandra is a NoSQL database that can handle large amounts of data and it can also handle heavy writing and reading. When Netflix started acquiring more users, the viewing history data for each member also started increasing. This increases the total number of viewing history data and it becomes challenging for Netflix to handle this massive amount of data.

Treat Servers as Stateless:
To understand this concept think of your servers like a herd of cows and you care about how many gallons of milk you get every day.
If one day you notice that you’re getting less milk from a cow then you just need to replace that cow (producing less milk) with another cow.
You don’t need to be dependent on a specific cow to get the required amount of milk. We can relate the above example to our application.
The idea is to design the service in such a way that if one of the endpoints is giving the error or if it’s not serving the request in a timely fashion then you can switch to another server and get your work done.

It includes a lot of powerful and flexible toolkits to display, monitor, and analyze the result.
Chukwe collects the events from different parts of the system and from Chukwe you can do monitoring and analysis or you can use the dashboard to view the events.
Chukwe writes the event in the Hadoop file sequence format (S3). After that Big Data team processes these S3 Hadoop files and writes Hive in Parquet data format.
This process is called batch processing which basically scans the whole data at the hourly or daily frequency.
To upload online events to EMR/S3, Chukwa also provide traffic to Kafka (the main gate in real-time data processing).

The data is shared across the cluster within the same zone and multiple copies of the cache are stored in sharded nodes.
Every time when write happens to the client all the nodes in all the clusters are updated but when the read happens to the cache, it is only sent to the nearest cluster (not all the cluster and nodes) and its nodes.
In case, a node is not available then read from a different available node. This approach increases performance, availability, and reliability.

These replicas require a lot of transcoding and preprocessing. Netflix breaks the original video into different smaller chunks and using parallel workers in AWS it converts these chunks into different formats (like mp4, 3gp, etc) across different resolutions (like 4k, 1080p, and more).

ev-cache

To solve this problem Netflix has built its own custom caching layer called EV cache. EV cache is based on Memcached and it is actually a wrapper around Memcached. 

Netflix has deployed a lot of clusters in a number of AWS EC2 instances and these clusters have so many nodes of Memcached and they also have cache clients.

---

The data is shared across the cluster within the same zone and multiple copies of the cache are stored in sharded nodes.
Every time when write happens to the client all the nodes in all the clusters are updated but when the read happens to the cache, it is only sent to the nearest cluster (not all the cluster and nodes) and its nodes.
In case, a node is not available then read from a different available node. This approach increases performance, availability, and reliability.  
3.4. Data Processing in Netflix Using Kafka And Apache Chukwa
When you click on a video Netflix starts processing data in various terms and it takes less than a nanosecond. Let’s discuss how the evolution pipeline works on Netflix.

---

mysql

All the read queries are redirected to the read replicas and only the write queries are redirected to the master nodes.

In the case of a primary master MySQL failure, the secondary master node will take over the primary role, and the route53 (DNS configuration) entry for the database will be changed to this new primary node.
This will also redirect the write queries to this new primary master node.  
4.2. Cassandra
Cassandra is a NoSQL database that can handle large amounts of data and it can also handle heavy writing and reading. When Netflix started acquiring more users, the viewing history data for each member also started increasing. This increases the total number of viewing history data and it becomes challenging for Netflix to handle this massive amount of data."
Is there any mention of reducing transmitted data?,No,Yes,There is no specific mention of reducing transmitted data to save energy.,"lix uses techniques like compression (e.g., LZ4 or Snappy for row-level storage in Cassandra, and protobufs/json compressed messages on the service level). This minimizes data size during transmission between services, improving performance while conserving bandwidth resources.",Data Efficiency,Reduce transmitted data,"This happens because the application keeps checking the best streaming open connect server and switches between formats (for the best viewing experience) when it’s needed.

2.1. Microservices Architecture of Netflix 
Netflix’s architectural style is built as a collection of services. This is known as microservices architecture and this power all of the APIs needed for applications and Web apps. When the request arrives at the endpoint it calls the other microservices for required data and these microservices can also request the data from different microservices. After that, a complete response for the API request is sent back to the endpoint.

---

3.1. How Does Netflix Onboard a Movie/Video?
Netflix receives very high-quality videos and content from the production houses, so before serving the videos to the users it does some preprocessing.

Netflix scaled the storage of viewing history data-keeping two main goals in their mind:

Smaller Storage Footprint.
Consistent Read/Write Performance as viewing per member grows (viewing history data write-to-read ratio is about 9:1 in Cassandra).
casandra-service-pattern

Total Denormalized Data Model  

Over 50 Cassandra Clusters
Over 500 Nodes
Over 30TB of daily backups
The biggest cluster has 72 nodes.
1 cluster over 250K writes/s
Initially, the viewing history was stored in Cassandra in a single row. When the number of users started increasing on Netflix the row sizes as well as the overall data size increased. This resulted in high storage, more operational cost, and slow performance of the application. The solution to this problem was to compress the old rows."
Is there any mention of setting storage retention policies?,No,No,The document does not mention setting storage retention policies.,"nation: The context provided does not include specific information about Netflix implementing or discussing the use of storage retention policies in their systems.

Is there any mention of queuing non-urgent processing requests,No,No,There is no specific mention of queuing non-urgent processing requests to reduce peak loads.,"provided context does not discuss using queueing mechanisms or prioritizing non-urgent tasks in the system design, implying no specific technology is mentioned for this purpose.",Performance Management,Queue non-urgent processing requests,"How to make microservice architecture reliable? 
Use Hystrix (Already explained above)
Separate Critical Microservices:
We can separate out some critical services (or endpoint or APIs) and make it less dependent or independent of other services.
You can also make some critical services dependent only on other reliable services.
While choosing the critical microservices you can include all the basic functionalities, like searching for a video, navigating to the videos, hitting and playing the video, etc.
This way you can make the endpoints highly available and even in worst-case scenarios at least a user will be able to do the basic things.
Treat Servers as Stateless:

---

These replicas require a lot of transcoding and preprocessing. Netflix breaks the original video into different smaller chunks and using parallel workers in AWS it converts these chunks into different formats (like mp4, 3gp, etc) across different resolutions (like 4k, 1080p, and more). After transcoding, once we have multiple copies of the files for the same movie, these files are transferred to each and every Open Connect server which is placed in different locations across the world. 

Below is the step by step process of how Netflix ensures optimal streaming quality:

Treat Servers as Stateless:
To understand this concept think of your servers like a herd of cows and you care about how many gallons of milk you get every day.
If one day you notice that you’re getting less milk from a cow then you just need to replace that cow (producing less milk) with another cow.
You don’t need to be dependent on a specific cow to get the required amount of milk. We can relate the above example to our application.
The idea is to design the service in such a way that if one of the endpoints is giving the error or if it’s not serving the request in a timely fashion then you can switch to another server and get your work done.

Video Recommendation System
If a user wants to discover some content or video on Netflix, the recommendation system of Netflix helps users to find their favorite movies or videos. To build this recommendation system Netflix has to predict the user interest and it gathers different kinds of data from the users such as:

---

The Netty server takes responsibility to handle the network protocol, web server, connection management, and proxying work. When the request will hit the Netty server, it will proxy the request to the inbound filter.
The inbound filter is responsible for authentication, routing, or decorating the request. Then it forwards the request to the endpoint filter.
The endpoint filter is used to return a static response or to forward the request to the backend service (or origin as we call it).
Once it receives the response from the backend service, it sends the request to the outbound filter."
Is there any mention of prioritizing critical traffic and shedding lower priority traffic?,No,No,There is no mention of prioritizing critical traffic and shedding lower priority traffic.,The provided context does not discuss or reference a strategy involving the differentiation between high-priority (critical) and low-priority traffic.,Performance Management,Shed lower priority traffic,"Treat Servers as Stateless:

Netflix uses Kafka and Apache Chukwe to ingest the data which is produced in a different part of the system. Netflix provides almost 500B data events that consume 1.3 PB/day and 8 million events that consume 24 GB/Second during peak time. These events include information like:

Error logs
UI activities
Performance events
Video viewing activities
Troubleshooting and diagnostic events.
Apache Chukwe is an open-source data collection system for collecting logs or events from a distributed system. It is built on top of HDFS and Map-reduce framework. It comes with Hadoop’s scalability and robustness features.

Now, there is a good chance that the other person will also have a similar pattern and he/she will do the same thing that the first person has done. 
Content-based filtering:
The idea is to filter those videos which are similar to the video a user has liked before.
Content-based filtering is highly dependent on the information from the products such as movie title, release year, actors, the genre.
So to implement this filtering it’s important to know the information describing each item and some sort of user profile describing what the user likes is also desirable.  
4. Database Design of Netflix System Design
Netflix uses two different databases i.e. MySQL(RDBMS) and Cassandra(NoSQL) for different purposes.

Content-based filtering is highly dependent on the information from the products such as movie title, release year, actors, the genre.
So to implement this filtering it’s important to know the information describing each item and some sort of user profile describing what the user likes is also desirable.  
4. Database Design of Netflix System Design
Netflix uses two different databases i.e. MySQL(RDBMS) and Cassandra(NoSQL) for different purposes."
Is there any mention of choosing server regions that are closest to users?,Yes,Not Applicable,The document mentions that Netflix serves videos from the nearest Open Connect server to the user.,"The context provided focuses on load balancing with the Elastic Load Balancer and data personalization using machine learning pipelines. It does not address selecting or managing server regions based on user location proximity, which would be relevant to optimizing latency for geographically distributed users.",Resource Optimization,Choose the region that is closest to users,"ev-cache

To solve this problem Netflix has built its own custom caching layer called EV cache. EV cache is based on Memcached and it is actually a wrapper around Memcached. 

Netflix has deployed a lot of clusters in a number of AWS EC2 instances and these clusters have so many nodes of Memcached and they also have cache clients.

mysql

All the read queries are redirected to the read replicas and only the write queries are redirected to the master nodes.

In the case of a primary master MySQL failure, the secondary master node will take over the primary role, and the route53 (DNS configuration) entry for the database will be changed to this new primary node.
This will also redirect the write queries to this new primary master node.  
4.2. Cassandra
Cassandra is a NoSQL database that can handle large amounts of data and it can also handle heavy writing and reading. When Netflix started acquiring more users, the viewing history data for each member also started increasing. This increases the total number of viewing history data and it becomes challenging for Netflix to handle this massive amount of data.

---

Netflix uses Kafka and Apache Chukwe to ingest the data which is produced in a different part of the system. Netflix provides almost 500B data events that consume 1.3 PB/day and 8 million events that consume 24 GB/Second during peak time. These events include information like:

Error logs
UI activities
Performance events
Video viewing activities
Troubleshooting and diagnostic events.
Apache Chukwe is an open-source data collection system for collecting logs or events from a distributed system. It is built on top of HDFS and Map-reduce framework. It comes with Hadoop’s scalability and robustness features.

ELB in Netflix is responsible for routing the traffic to front-end services. ELB performs a two-tier load-balancing scheme where the load is balanced over zones first and then instances (servers).

---

When you load the front page you see multiple rows of different kinds of movies. Netflix personalizes this data and decides what kind of rows or what kind of movies should be displayed to a specific user. This data is based on the user’s historical data and preferences.

Also, for that specific user, Netflix performs sorting of the movies and calculates the relevance ranking (for the recommendation) of these movies available on their platform. In Netflix, Apache Spark is used for content recommendations and personalization.

A majority of the machine learning pipelines are run on these large spark clusters. These pipelines are then used to do row selection, sorting, title relevance ranking, and artwork personalization among others."

The data is shared across the cluster within the same zone and multiple copies of the cache are stored in sharded nodes.
Every time when write happens to the client all the nodes in all the clusters are updated but when the read happens to the cache, it is only sent to the nearest cluster (not all the cluster and nodes) and its nodes.
In case, a node is not available then read from a different available node. This approach increases performance, availability, and reliability.

To solve this problem Netflix has built its own custom caching layer called EV cache. EV cache is based on Memcached and it is actually a wrapper around Memcached. 

Netflix has deployed a lot of clusters in a number of AWS EC2 instances and these clusters have so many nodes of Memcached and they also have cache clients.

Netflix uses Kafka and Apache Chukwe to ingest the data which is produced in a different part of the system. Netflix provides almost 500B data events that consume 1.3 PB/day and 8 million events that consume 24 GB/Second during peak time. These events include information like:

Error logs
UI activities
Performance events
Video viewing activities
Troubleshooting and diagnostic events.
Apache Chukwe is an open-source data collection system for collecting logs or events from a distributed system. It is built on top of HDFS and Map-reduce framework. It comes with Hadoop’s scalability and robustness features.

---

It includes a lot of powerful and flexible toolkits to display, monitor, and analyze the result.
Chukwe collects the events from different parts of the system and from Chukwe you can do monitoring and analysis or you can use the dashboard to view the events.
Chukwe writes the event in the Hadoop file sequence format (S3). After that Big Data team processes these S3 Hadoop files and writes Hive in Parquet data format.
This process is called batch processing which basically scans the whole data at the hourly or daily frequency.
To upload online events to EMR/S3, Chukwa also provide traffic to Kafka (the main gate in real-time data processing).

mysql

All the read queries are redirected to the read replicas and only the write queries are redirected to the master nodes.

In the case of a primary master MySQL failure, the secondary master node will take over the primary role, and the route53 (DNS configuration) entry for the database will be changed to this new primary node.
This will also redirect the write queries to this new primary master node.  
4.2. Cassandra
Cassandra is a NoSQL database that can handle large amounts of data and it can also handle heavy writing and reading. When Netflix started acquiring more users, the viewing history data for each member also started increasing. This increases the total number of viewing history data and it becomes challenging for Netflix to handle this massive amount of data.

Now, there is a good chance that the other person will also have a similar pattern and he/she will do the same thing that the first person has done. 
Content-based filtering:
The idea is to filter those videos which are similar to the video a user has liked before.
Content-based filtering is highly dependent on the information from the products such as movie title, release year, actors, the genre.
So to implement this filtering it’s important to know the information describing each item and some sort of user profile describing what the user likes is also desirable.  
4. Database Design of Netflix System Design
Netflix uses two different databases i.e. MySQL(RDBMS) and Cassandra(NoSQL) for different purposes."
Is there any mention of implementing a stateless design?,Yes,Yes,The document mentions treating servers as stateless to improve scalability and reliability.,"The provided context explicitly mentions the practice of treating servers as stateful, where if an endpoint fails or does not serve requests promptly, other endpoints can be utilized to ensure continuous operation. This indicates that a stateless design approach is being implemented in Netflix's system architecture.",Performance Management,Implement stateless design,"Treat Servers as Stateless:
To understand this concept think of your servers like a herd of cows and you care about how many gallons of milk you get every day.
If one day you notice that you’re getting less milk from a cow then you just need to replace that cow (producing less milk) with another cow.
You don’t need to be dependent on a specific cow to get the required amount of milk. We can relate the above example to our application.
The idea is to design the service in such a way that if one of the endpoints is giving the error or if it’s not serving the request in a timely fashion then you can switch to another server and get your work done.

An outbound filter is used for zipping the content, calculating the metrics, or adding/removing custom headers. After that, the response is sent back to the Netty server and then it is received by the client.
Advantages of using ZUUL:

---

The data is shared across the cluster within the same zone and multiple copies of the cache are stored in sharded nodes.
Every time when write happens to the client all the nodes in all the clusters are updated but when the read happens to the cache, it is only sent to the nearest cluster (not all the cluster and nodes) and its nodes.
In case, a node is not available then read from a different available node. This approach increases performance, availability, and reliability.  
3.4. Data Processing in Netflix Using Kafka And Apache Chukwa
When you click on a video Netflix starts processing data in various terms and it takes less than a nanosecond. Let’s discuss how the evolution pipeline works on Netflix.

These replicas require a lot of transcoding and preprocessing. Netflix breaks the original video into different smaller chunks and using parallel workers in AWS it converts these chunks into different formats (like mp4, 3gp, etc) across different resolutions (like 4k, 1080p, and more). After transcoding, once we have multiple copies of the files for the same movie, these files are transferred to each and every Open Connect server which is placed in different locations across the world. 

Below is the step by step process of how Netflix ensures optimal streaming quality:"
