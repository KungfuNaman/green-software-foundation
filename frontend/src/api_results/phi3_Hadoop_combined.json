The specific details regarding monitoring tools to identify and remove unused storage resources aren't provided directly from this context but can be inferred based on HDFS behavior as follows:\n\n1) Unused Storage Identification - While it is not explicitly mentioned, standard practices within clusters like Hadoop may include using built-in utilities or third-party tools to monitor the cluster and identify unutilized storage. These tools typically report available space that can be used for new data blocks without affecting overall system performance significantly since these tasks are often run during low activity periods in a distributed environment, thus not hampering fault tolerance capabilities directly but supporting efficient use of resources indirectly.\n\n2) Fault Tolerance and Rack Awareness - HDFS maintains replicas on different racks to minimize data loss when an entire rack fails; ideally this ensures that at least one copy remains accessible in the case of hardware failure or network partitioning within a single DataNode's rack. However, with simultaneous failures across multiple Racks and given the described replication policies (random placement for replicas beyond three), it is conceivable to lose up to two copies if such an unlikely event occurs as per HDFS design principles aiming at achieving 'at least five copies' of each block.\n\nIn terms of load balancing, by not evenly distributing the DataNodes across racks for replica placement and instead utilizing a randomized approach along with keeping more on-rack but limiting interrack transfers per write operation, Hadoop attempts to optimize read performance through data locality while still maintaining an acceptable level of fault tolerance. Write operations might incur higher costs as they may need to transfer blocks across racks; however, this is a trade-off for enhanced read speeds and better load distribution on component failure which can help with overall cluster balance during heavy usage periods or when rebalancing after node failures occur within the Hadoop environment.", "result": "No", "category": "Resource Optimization", "practice": "Delete unused storage resources", "type": "Cloud"}, {"query": "Does the application/framework apply encryption selectively to only sensitive data to optimize energy usage?", "explanation": "Based on the provided context, there is no mention of any application or framework applying encryption selectively to only sensitive data for optimizing energy usage.
