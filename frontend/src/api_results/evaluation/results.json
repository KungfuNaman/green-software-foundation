Microservices Architecture of Netflix \nNetflix\u2019s architectural style is built as a collection of services. This is known as microservices architecture and this power all of the APIs needed for applications and Web apps. When the request arrives at the endpoint it calls the other microservices for required data and these microservices can also request the data from different microservices. After that, a complete response for the API request is sent back to the endpoint.\n\n---\n\nmicroservice-architecture\n\nIn a microservice architecture, services should be independent of each other. For example, The video storage service would be decoupled from the service responsible for transcoding videos.\n\n---\n\nThis happens because the application keeps checking the best streaming open connect server and switches between formats (for the best viewing experience) when it\u2019s needed. \nUser data is saved in AWS such as searches, viewing, location, device, reviews, and likes, Netflix uses it to build the movie recommendation for users using the Machine learning model or Hadoop.\n\n---\n\n3.1. How Does Netflix Onboard a Movie/Video?\nNetflix receives very high-quality videos and content from the production houses, so before serving the videos to the users it does some preprocessing."
