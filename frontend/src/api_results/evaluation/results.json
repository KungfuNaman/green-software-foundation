We can relate the above example to our application.\nThe idea is to design the service in such a way that if one of the endpoints is giving the error or if it\u2019s not serving the request in a timely fashion then you can switch to another server and get your work done.\n3. Low Level Design of Netflix System Design\n3.1. How Does Netflix Onboard a Movie/Video?\n\n---\n\nAn outbound filter is used for zipping the content, calculating the metrics, or adding/removing custom headers. After that, the response is sent back to the Netty server and then it is received by the client.\nAdvantages of using ZUUL:\n\n---\n\nNetflix uses Kafka and Apache Chukwe to ingest the data which is produced in a different part of the system. Netflix provides almost 500B data events that consume 1.3 PB/day and 8 million events that consume 24 GB/Second during peak time. These events include information like:\n\nError logs\nUI activities\nPerformance events\nVideo viewing activities\nTroubleshooting and diagnostic events.\nApache Chukwe is an open-source data collection system for collecting logs or events from a distributed system. It is built on top of HDFS and Map-reduce framework. It comes with Hadoop\u2019s scalability and robustness features.\n\n---\n\nHow to make microservice architecture reliable? \nUse Hystrix (Already explained above)\nSeparate Critical Microservices:\nWe can separate out some critical services (or endpoint or APIs) and make it less dependent or independent of other services.\nYou can also make some critical services dependent only on other reliable services.\nWhile choosing the critical microservices you can include all the basic functionalities, like searching for a video, navigating to the videos, hitting and playing the video, etc.\nThis way you can make the endpoints highly available and even in worst-case scenarios at least a user will be able to do the basic things.\nTreat Servers as Stateless:\n\n---\n\nNow, there is a good chance that the other person will also have a similar pattern and he/she will do the same thing that the first person has done. \nContent-based filtering:\nThe idea is to filter those videos which are similar to the video a user has liked before.\nContent-based filtering is highly dependent on the information from the products such as movie title, release year, actors, the genre.\nSo to implement this filtering it\u2019s important to know the information describing each item and some sort of user profile describing what the user likes is also desirable.  \n4. Database Design of Netflix System Design\nNetflix uses two different databases i.e. MySQL(RDBMS) and Cassandra(NoSQL) for different purposes."

It is built on top of HDFS and Map-reduce framework. It comes with Hadoop\u2019s scalability and robustness features.\n\n---\n\nev-cache\n\nTo solve this problem Netflix has built its own custom caching layer called EV cache. EV cache is based on Memcached and it is actually a wrapper around Memcached. \n\nNetflix has deployed a lot of clusters in a number of AWS EC2 instances and these clusters have so many nodes of Memcached and they also have cache clients.\n\n---\n\nIt includes a lot of powerful and flexible toolkits to display, monitor, and analyze the result.\nChukwe collects the events from different parts of the system and from Chukwe you can do monitoring and analysis or you can use the dashboard to view the events.\nChukwe writes the event in the Hadoop file sequence format (S3). After that Big Data team processes these S3 Hadoop files and writes Hive in Parquet data format.\nThis process is called batch processing which basically scans the whole data at the hourly or daily frequency.\nTo upload online events to EMR/S3, Chukwa also provide traffic to Kafka (the main gate in real-time data processing).\n\n---\n\nmysql\n\nAll the read queries are redirected to the read replicas and only the write queries are redirected to the master nodes.\n\nIn the case of a primary master MySQL failure, the secondary master node will take over the primary role, and the route53 (DNS configuration) entry for the database will be changed to this new primary node.\nThis will also redirect the write queries to this new primary master node.  \n4.2. Cassandra\nCassandra is a NoSQL database that can handle large amounts of data and it can also handle heavy writing and reading. When Netflix started acquiring more users, the viewing history data for each member also started increasing. This increases the total number of viewing history data and it becomes challenging for Netflix to handle this massive amount of data."

You can linearly add capacity by adding more servers.\r\nIt should be able to handle a lot of reads and writes because once every 4-second cabs will be sending the GPS location and that location will be updated in the database.\r\nThe system should never give downtime for any operation. It should be highly available no matter what operation you perform (expanding storage, backup, when new nodes are added, etc).\r\nEarlier Uber was using the RDBMS PostgreSQL database but due to scalability issues uber switched to various databases. Uber uses a NoSQL database (schemaless) built on top of the MySQL database.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n3.7 How Does Uber Defines a Map Region?\r\nBefore launching a new operation in a new area, Uber onboarded the new region to the map technology stack.

We can use AI-simulated algorithms or simple Dijkstra\u2019s algorithm to find out the best route in this graph.\r\nIn that graph, nodes represent intersections (available cabs), and edges represent road segments.\r\nWe represent the road segment distance or the traveling time through the edge weight. We also represent and model some additional factors in our graph such as one-way streets, turn costs, turn restrictions, and speed limits. \r\nOnce the data structure is decided we can find the best route using Dijkstra\u2019s search algorithm which is one of the best modern routing algorithms today.
