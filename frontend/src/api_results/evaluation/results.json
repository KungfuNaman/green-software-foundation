Netflix provides almost 500B data events that consume 1.3 PB/day and 8 million events that consume 24 GB/Second during peak time. These events include information like:\n\nError logs\nUI activities\nPerformance events\nVideo viewing activities\nTroubleshooting and diagnostic events.\nApache Chukwe is an open-source data collection system for collecting logs or events from a distributed system. It is built on top of HDFS and Map-reduce framework. It comes with Hadoop\u2019s scalability and robustness features.\n\n---\n\nev-cache\n\nTo solve this problem Netflix has built its own custom caching layer called EV cache. EV cache is based on Memcached and it is actually a wrapper around Memcached. \n\nNetflix has deployed a lot of clusters in a number of AWS EC2 instances and these clusters have so many nodes of Memcached and they also have cache clients.\n\n---\n\nTreat Servers as Stateless:\nTo understand this concept think of your servers like a herd of cows and you care about how many gallons of milk you get every day.\nIf one day you notice that you\u2019re getting less milk from a cow then you just need to replace that cow (producing less milk) with another cow.\nYou don\u2019t need to be dependent on a specific cow to get the required amount of milk. We can relate the above example to our application.\nThe idea is to design the service in such a way that if one of the endpoints is giving the error or if it\u2019s not serving the request in a timely fashion then you can switch to another server and get your work done.\n3. Low Level Design of Netflix System Design\n3.1. How Does Netflix Onboard a Movie/Video?\n\n---\n\nmysql\n\nAll the read queries are redirected to the read replicas and only the write queries are redirected to the master nodes.\n\nIn the case of a primary master MySQL failure, the secondary master node will take over the primary role, and the route53 (DNS configuration) entry for the database will be changed to this new primary node.\nThis will also redirect the write queries to this new primary master node.  \n4.2. Cassandra\nCassandra is a NoSQL database that can handle large amounts of data and it can also handle heavy writing and reading. When Netflix started acquiring more users, the viewing history data for each member also started increasing. This increases the total number of viewing history data and it becomes challenging for Netflix to handle this massive amount of data.\n\n---\n\nWhen you load the front page you see multiple rows of different kinds of movies. Netflix personalizes this data and decides what kind of rows or what kind of movies should be displayed to a specific user. This data is based on the user\u2019s historical data and preferences.\n\nAlso, for that specific user, Netflix performs sorting of the movies and calculates the relevance ranking (for the recommendation) of these movies available on their platform. In Netflix, Apache Spark is used for content recommendations and personalization.\n\nA majority of the machine learning pipelines are run on these large spark clusters. These pipelines are then used to do row selection, sorting, title relevance ranking, and artwork personalization among others."

This approach increases performance, availability, and reliability.  \n3.4.

Netflix personalizes this data and decides what kind of rows or what kind of movies should be displayed to a specific user. This data is based on the user\u2019s historical data and preferences.\n\nAlso, for that specific user, Netflix performs sorting of the movies and calculates the relevance ranking (for the recommendation) of these movies available on their platform. In Netflix, Apache Spark is used for content recommendations and personalization.\n\nA majority of the machine learning pipelines are run on these large spark clusters. These pipelines are then used to do row selection, sorting, title relevance ranking, and artwork personalization among others."

It comes with Hadoop\u2019s scalability and robustness features.\n\n---\n\nHow to make microservice architecture reliable? \nUse Hystrix (Already explained above)\nSeparate Critical Microservices:\nWe can separate out some critical services (or endpoint or APIs) and make it less dependent or independent of other services.\nYou can also make some critical services dependent only on other reliable services.\nWhile choosing the critical microservices you can include all the basic functionalities, like searching for a video, navigating to the videos, hitting and playing the video, etc.\nThis way you can make the endpoints highly available and even in worst-case scenarios at least a user will be able to do the basic things.\nTreat Servers as Stateless:\n\n---\n\nThe data is shared across the cluster within the same zone and multiple copies of the cache are stored in sharded nodes.\nEvery time when write happens to the client all the nodes in all the clusters are updated but when the read happens to the cache, it is only sent to the nearest cluster (not all the cluster and nodes) and its nodes.\nIn case, a node is not available then read from a different available node. This approach increases performance, availability, and reliability.  \n3.4.

Let\u2019s discuss how the evolution pipeline works on Netflix."

            "ecoDocContext": "Treat Servers as Stateless:\nTo understand this concept think of your servers like a herd of cows and you care about how many gallons of milk you get every day.\nIf one day you notice that you\u2019re getting less milk from a cow then you just need to replace that cow (producing less milk) with another cow.\nYou don\u2019t need to be dependent on a specific cow to get the required amount of milk. We can relate the above example to our application.\nThe idea is to design the service in such a way that if one of the endpoints is giving the error or if it\u2019s not serving the request in a timely fashion then you can switch to another server and get your work done.\n3. Low Level Design of Netflix System Design\n3.1. How Does Netflix Onboard a Movie/Video?\n\n---\n\nNetflix uses Kafka and Apache Chukwe to ingest the data which is produced in a different part of the system. Netflix provides almost 500B data events that consume 1.3 PB/day and 8 million events that consume 24 GB/Second during peak time. These events include information like:\n\nError logs\nUI activities\nPerformance events\nVideo viewing activities\nTroubleshooting and diagnostic events.\nApache Chukwe is an open-source data collection system for collecting logs or events from a distributed system. It is built on top of HDFS and Map-reduce framework. It comes with Hadoop\u2019s scalability and robustness features.\n\n---\n\nev-cache\n\nTo solve this problem Netflix has built its own custom caching layer called EV cache. EV cache is based on Memcached and it is actually a wrapper around Memcached. \n\nNetflix has deployed a lot of clusters in a number of AWS EC2 instances and these clusters have so many nodes of Memcached and they also have cache clients.\n\n---\n\nIt includes a lot of powerful and flexible toolkits to display, monitor, and analyze the result.\nChukwe collects the events from different parts of the system and from Chukwe you can do monitoring and analysis or you can use the dashboard to view the events.\nChukwe writes the event in the Hadoop file sequence format (S3). After that Big Data team processes these S3 Hadoop files and writes Hive in Parquet data format.\nThis process is called batch processing which basically scans the whole data at the hourly or daily frequency.\nTo upload online events to EMR/S3, Chukwa also provide traffic to Kafka (the main gate in real-time data processing).\n\n---\n\nmysql\n\nAll the read queries are redirected to the read replicas and only the write queries are redirected to the master nodes.\n\nIn the case of a primary master MySQL failure, the secondary master node will take over the primary role, and the route53 (DNS configuration) entry for the database will be changed to this new primary node.\nThis will also redirect the write queries to this new primary master node.  \n4.2. Cassandra\nCassandra is a NoSQL database that can handle large amounts of data and it can also handle heavy writing and reading. When Netflix started acquiring more users, the viewing history data for each member also started increasing. This increases the total number of viewing history data and it becomes challenging for Netflix to handle this massive amount of data."

This is known as Horizontal Scaling and each service can be independently scaled horizontally in our design.\nDatabase Sharding\nMetadata DB is sharded based on object_id. Our hash function will map each object_id to a random server where we can store the file/folder metadata. To query for a particular object_id, service can determine the database server using same hash function and query for data. This approach will distribute our database load to multiple servers making it scalable.\nCache Sharding\n\n---\n\nRequest Queue:\nThis will be a global request queue shared among all the clients.\nWhenever a client receives any update or changes in the files/folder it sends the request through the request queue.\nThis request is received by the synchronization service to update the metadata database.\nResponse Queue:\nThere will be an individual response queue corresponding to the individual clients.\nThe synchronization service broadcast the update through this response queue and this response queue will deliver the updated messages to each client and then these clients will update their respective files accordingly.\nThe message will never be lost even if the client will be disconnected from the internet (the benefit of using the messaging queue service).\n\n---\n\nIt gives a notification to the indexer and chunker if any action is performed in the files or folders.\nChunker breaks the files into multiple small pieces called chunks and uploads them to the cloud storage with a unique id or hash of these chunks.\nTo recreate the files these chunks can be joined together.

Uploading to S3 using Presigned URL and Metadata:\nThe client uses the Presigned URL to upload the file directly to the designated S3 bucket. Metadata associated with the file, such as file name and owner, is included in the upload process. This ensures that the file\u2019s metadata is synchronized with its corresponding data in S3.\n\n3.7. Role of Task Runner:\nAfter the file is successfully uploaded to S3, a task runner process is triggered. The task runner communicates with the Metadata Database to update or perform additional tasks related to the uploaded file. This may include updating file status, triggering indexing for search functionality, or sending notifications."
