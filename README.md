# EcoDoc Sense
## 1. Overview
EcoDoc Sense is a web application that focusing on analysing the compliance of software architecture documents
with certain green software patterns. A sustainability report is generated based on developerâ€™s
software architecture document, highlighting whether green software patterns are being adhered to
or overlooked. Additionally, it provides suggestions on which green patterns should be implemented
in the software. 


## 2. Project Structure
### Backend 
Built out the main RAG ( Retrieval-Augmented Generation ) pipeline for the project 
and uses FastAPI to implement the RESTful service. Code in "Rag" folder.

### Frontend 
Built out a user-friendly web user interface with the React Framework.

### Scripts
The scripts for finetuning the models are included in the "Finetuning" folder.

### Local Tools
Ollama is used as the local LLM launcher in the project.


## 3. Run on Local PC
### Get ready for Ollama
Install [**Ollama**](https://www.ollama.com/) to local machine. After that, pull necessary models.
```bash
# pull Llama2 for embeddings generation
ollama pull llama2

# pull LLaVA for image extraction of user's document
ollama pull llava
```
Download finetuned model for final answer generation [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1l1dnbQlQGiQVCTp925pB07Sh3cYnViKR/view?usp=sharing).<br/>
Then, copy the Modelfile in project root directory to where you store the finetuned model.<br/>
After that, create a model instance by Modelfile.
```bash
# create the model instance
ollama create fineTunedModel -f /root/Modelfile
```

### Start backend server
```bash
# change directory
cd .\Rag\

# install dependencies
pip install -r .\requirements.txt

# start server
python .\api.py
```

### Start frontend server
```bash
# change directory
 cd .\frontend\

# install dependencies
npm install

# start server
