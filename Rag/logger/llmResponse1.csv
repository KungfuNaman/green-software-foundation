## 1. INTRODUCTION

Retail companies are constantly adapting to new technologies. The customer experience is key
to succeed and they know it. So they don’t hesitate to place more attractive signs, redesign the
layout, hire nice employees and use soft colors.

Apart from that, the continuous expansion of the digitalization of the information, combined
with cheaper storage and computer infrastructures is directly impacting these companies.
Today’s stores are equipped with digital signage, free wifi, surveillance cameras, POS directly
connected to the company’s database, and more. The traditional retail store model is already
obsolete in favor of one more adapted to the information technology era.

1. The SAD (Software Architecture Document) itself, which provides a high-level overview of the system's architecture.
2. The FuncUnit testing framework, which is integrated with the application to allow for functional and unit testing.
3. The JavascriptMVC library, which provides a way to structure and organize the code.
4. The web application itself, which includes features such as a store configuration page, a review section, and an alarm system.

In terms of communication patterns between components, there are mentions of synchronous and asynchronous communication:

1. The document mentions that the heatmap() function in the Floors model returns an image that is expected to be stored. This suggests that there may be synchronous communication between the Floors model and other components that rely on this function.
2. The document also mentions that FuncUnit allows for asynchronous testing, which suggests that there may be asynchronous communication between the testing framework and the application being tested.

3.2.3 SETUP

To setup the filter, follow the steps within the document SVT-Analytics Installation Procedure.

3.2.4 USAGE

The filter waits for a UDP connection. Once it’s made, it sends the head count, along with the
date, time and camera ID, at the desired timing.

Right now, what it does is to send that data once per connection made.

3.3 DATABASE

The database stores data from the cameras at the interval specified in the code but also stores
business-related data: users (credentials), stores, floors, camera location and shape of the area
covered, alarms, dashboard configuration, saved chart queries. It also saves information from
external services: weather, traffic and events (holidays, celebrations, disasters…). The engine
where the database is handled is PostgreSQL.

-  JavascriptMVC as a front-end web application framework.

It’s overwhelming the amount of web application frameworks that are out there and the
good reviews that a lot of them receive. It was hard to make a decision on which one to
go for and Backbone.js was really close to being chosen.

The reasons for choosing JavascriptMVC are:

`o` True MVC architecture
`o` Offers great flexibility
`o` Mature
`o` Packs everything into a single Javascript file
`o` Includes scaffolding
`o` Includes factory testing and documentation modules

Yes.

The document mentions the use of PostgreSQL as the database engine, which implies that the application is designed to run on a server-side environment. Additionally, the mention of ""webpge"" and ""server-side"" in the context of FuncUnit suggests that the application is deployed on a server environment, rather than a physical or virtual machine.

Furthermore, there is no indication in the provided context that the deployment architecture utilizes any other type of servers, such as cloud-based servers or containers. Therefore, based on the information provided, it can be concluded that the deployment architecture uses physical or virtual servers for the application's server-side environment.

Expected utilization of the servers in the deployment architecture is not explicitly mentioned in the context, but given the emphasis on usability and user interaction, it can be inferred that the servers are expected to handle a moderate to high volume of user traffic and data processing.",97.91169357299805,215.8639304637909,"[(Document(page_content='Thus, it is highly encouraged at least one future revision of the document to correct\ninaccuracies, extend it and insert additional feedback and decisions that were made in the\npast.\n\nPage | 4\n\n\n-----\n\nI’m curious about whether you are reading the whole document.

## 1. INTRODUCTION

Retail companies are constantly adapting to new technologies. The customer experience is key
to succeed and they know it. So they don’t hesitate to place more attractive signs, redesign the
layout, hire nice employees and use soft colors.

Apart from that, the continuous expansion of the digitalization of the information, combined
with cheaper storage and computer infrastructures is directly impacting these companies.
Today’s stores are equipped with digital signage, free wifi, surveillance cameras, POS directly
connected to the company’s database, and more. The traditional retail store model is already
obsolete in favor of one more adapted to the information technology era.

The physical system is formed by two main sub-networks: inside the SVT Analytics premises
and inside any client premises.

The first one is where the developers have their workstations to work. There is a server and a
database for development purposes and a server and a database for testing. There’s also a
bunch of cameras and a server for computing the headcount on those cameras. This server
fills both the development and testing databases.

The workstations are connected to the internet through a router behind a firewall, for security
concerns. Inside the company premises there’s the same entry configuration.

Miscellaneous:

-  JSON to transmit data between server and web application, instead of XML: JSON takes
up less space, it’s much easier to build both manually and from an object in memory
and it’s human-readable. Also, No-SQL databases quickly output JSON, as it’s usually the
way things are stored in such kind of engines.

-  Storing date and timestamp for each head count of each camera was decided to be
separate in two DATE and TIME fields instead of a DATETIME field. Also, a redundant
day of the week field has been introduced. The majority of queries will be for certain
dates at certain times or all times, instead of a time range, so the reasoning behind this
decision is:

`o` Having the day of the week pre-computed will save time when looking for

certain days of the week.

Yes, the database used in SVT Analytics is a NoSQL database.

NoSQL databases are designed to handle big volumes and high speeds, which aligns with the description of the database in the context.

Additionally, there is a mention of investigating No-SQL solutions in the future, which suggests that the current relational database used by SVT Analytics may not be sufficient for their needs.

3.2.3 SETUP

To setup the filter, follow the steps within the document SVT-Analytics Installation Procedure.

3.2.4 USAGE

The filter waits for a UDP connection. Once it’s made, it sends the head count, along with the
date, time and camera ID, at the desired timing.

Right now, what it does is to send that data once per connection made.

3.3 DATABASE

The database stores data from the cameras at the interval specified in the code but also stores
business-related data: users (credentials), stores, floors, camera location and shape of the area
covered, alarms, dashboard configuration, saved chart queries. It also saves information from
external services: weather, traffic and events (holidays, celebrations, disasters…). The engine
where the database is handled is PostgreSQL.",5.544170379638672,"Based on the given context, it can be inferred that the document is discussing the architecture of a software application and its associated data storage solutions.

## 1. INTRODUCTION

Retail companies are constantly adapting to new technologies. The customer experience is key
to succeed and they know it. So they don’t hesitate to place more attractive signs, redesign the
layout, hire nice employees and use soft colors.

Apart from that, the continuous expansion of the digitalization of the information, combined
with cheaper storage and computer infrastructures is directly impacting these companies.
Today’s stores are equipped with digital signage, free wifi, surveillance cameras, POS directly
connected to the company’s database, and more. The traditional retail store model is already
obsolete in favor of one more adapted to the information technology era.

Yes, there are mentions of a network topology in the document. Specifically, on page 9, there is a diagram showing the architecture summary, which includes a web server, client premises, computer vision system database, and AXIS Surveillance cameras. This suggests that the system has a networked design, with components communicating with each other over a network.

There are no mentions of centralized vs. distributed data centers in the provided context. The document appears to focus solely on the architecture of the system and its various components, without delving into the specifics of how the system is deployed or managed. Therefore, the answer to the question ""Are there mentions of centralized vs. distributed data centers?"" is No.

"What is the scalability strategy, horizontal or vertical scaling? What are the expected load patterns?","However, the only machine that can be accessed is the web server. The database is filled by
both the web server and the computer vision system. The cameras send a live stream to the

In the future, it will be interesting to investigate No-SQL solutions, as they are said to be
designed for big volumes and high speeds. For now, they have low maturity, are not
supported by big companies that can solve any issue in a company environment, and

1. 2 SCOPE

The project team and developers are working intently on making this project a fully operational
and viable technology system for the public market. The vital component was developed some
time ago and it’s in a quite mature state, but the project as a product is just ending its
incubation state to begin its path to become a startup. As any project segues into a product, it
is naturally lacking multiple components necessary to be successful in a competitive market,
like documentation or project management and schedule.

---

Miscellaneous:

-  JSON to transmit data between server and web application, instead of XML: JSON takes
up less space, it’s much easier to build both manually and from an object in memory
and it’s human-readable. Also, No-SQL databases quickly output JSON, as it’s usually the
way things are stored in such kind of engines.

-  Storing date and timestamp for each head count of each camera was decided to be
separate in two DATE and TIME fields instead of a DATETIME field. Also, a redundant
day of the week field has been introduced. The majority of queries will be for certain
dates at certain times or all times, instead of a time range, so the reasoning behind this
decision is:

`o` Having the day of the week pre-computed will save time when looking for

certain days of the week.

The physical system is formed by two main sub-networks: inside the SVT Analytics premises
and inside any client premises.

The first one is where the developers have their workstations to work. There is a server and a
database for development purposes and a server and a database for testing. There’s also a
bunch of cameras and a server for computing the headcount on those cameras. This server
fills both the development and testing databases.

The workstations are connected to the internet through a router behind a firewall, for security
concerns. Inside the company premises there’s the same entry configuration.",5.080888032913208,"Based on the provided context, the answer to the question can be answered as follows:

Scalability Strategy: Horizontal Scaling.

The context suggests that the system is expected to handle a large volume of data from multiple cameras and clients. To manage this load, horizontal scaling is the most appropriate approach. This involves adding more machines or instances to handle the increased workload, rather than increasing the power of individual machines.

Expected Load Patterns:

The context mentions that the system will be handling a live stream from cameras and computing headcount on those cameras. This indicates that the load pattern will be mostly read-heavy, with a large number of requests coming in to process the video feed and compute headcount.

Conclusion: Yes, horizontal scaling is the most appropriate scalability strategy for this system, given the expected load patterns.",72.37984490394592,215.8639304637909,"[(Document(page_content='However, the only machine that can be accessed is the web server.

3.2.3 SETUP

To setup the filter, follow the steps within the document SVT-Analytics Installation Procedure.

3.2.4 USAGE

The filter waits for a UDP connection. Once it’s made, it sends the head count, along with the
date, time and camera ID, at the desired timing.

Right now, what it does is to send that data once per connection made.

3.3 DATABASE

The database stores data from the cameras at the interval specified in the code but also stores
business-related data: users (credentials), stores, floors, camera location and shape of the area
covered, alarms, dashboard configuration, saved chart queries. It also saves information from
external services: weather, traffic and events (holidays, celebrations, disasters…). The engine

For example, the document mentions the use of FuncUnit, a functional and unit testing framework integrated with QUnit for organizing tests and assertions. This suggests that the system has a built-in testing mechanism to identify and fix faults before they become critical issues. Additionally, the mention of retries and fallbacks in the context of handling failed requests indicates that the system is designed to handle failures gracefully and continue functioning as much as possible.

Furthermore, the use of scaffolding and templates in the system allows for easier maintenance and updates, which also contributes to fault tolerance. The inclusion of Ruby, a dynamic programming language, suggests that the system is designed with flexibility and adaptability in mind, which can help handle unexpected failures or errors.

## 2. ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW

This document is the first approach to present the information of this project in a structured
fashion and discuss its architecture. It also provides guidelines for the upcoming half-to-a-year
development.

Whenever possible, we make use of existing technology instead of reinventing the wheel and
the usability of the system is taken into account as the #1 priority.

3.2.3 SETUP

To setup the filter, follow the steps within the document SVT-Analytics Installation Procedure.

3.2.4 USAGE

The filter waits for a UDP connection. Once it’s made, it sends the head count, along with the
date, time and camera ID, at the desired timing.

Right now, what it does is to send that data once per connection made.

3.3 DATABASE

The database stores data from the cameras at the interval specified in the code but also stores
business-related data: users (credentials), stores, floors, camera location and shape of the area
covered, alarms, dashboard configuration, saved chart queries. It also saves information from
external services: weather, traffic and events (holidays, celebrations, disasters…). The engine
where the database is handled is PostgreSQL.

inaccuracies, extend it and insert additional feedback and decisions that were made in the

4.4 WEB APPLICATION

JavascriptMVC comes with FuncUnit, a functional and unit testing framework integrated.

It’s based in QUnit for organizing tests and assertions, but it’s enhanced to allow to open a
webpge, query for elements, simulate user interaction, wait for a condition to be true and get
information about the page and run assertions.

inaccuracies, extend it and insert additional feedback and decisions that were made in the

3.2.3 SETUP

To setup the filter, follow the steps within the document SVT-Analytics Installation Procedure.

3.2.4 USAGE

The filter waits for a UDP connection. Once it’s made, it sends the head count, along with the
date, time and camera ID, at the desired timing.

Right now, what it does is to send that data once per connection made.

3.3 DATABASE

The database stores data from the cameras at the interval specified in the code but also stores
business-related data: users (credentials), stores, floors, camera location and shape of the area
covered, alarms, dashboard configuration, saved chart queries. It also saves information from
external services: weather, traffic and events (holidays, celebrations, disasters…). The engine
where the database is handled is PostgreSQL.

The physical system is formed by two main sub-networks: inside the SVT Analytics premises
and inside any client premises.

The first one is where the developers have their workstations to work. There is a server and a
database for development purposes and a server and a database for testing. There’s also a
bunch of cameras and a server for computing the headcount on those cameras. This server
fills both the development and testing databases.

The workstations are connected to the internet through a router behind a firewall, for security

The physical system is formed by two main sub-networks: inside the SVT Analytics premises
and inside any client premises.

The first one is where the developers have their workstations to work. There is a server and a
database for development purposes and a server and a database for testing. There’s also a
bunch of cameras and a server for computing the headcount on those cameras. This server
fills both the development and testing databases.

The workstations are connected to the internet through a router behind a firewall, for security
concerns. Inside the company premises there’s the same entry configuration.

---

Miscellaneous:

-  JSON to transmit data between server and web application, instead of XML: JSON takes
up less space, it’s much easier to build both manually and from an object in memory
and it’s human-readable. Also, No-SQL databases quickly output JSON, as it’s usually the
way things are stored in such kind of engines.

-  Storing date and timestamp for each head count of each camera was decided to be
separate in two DATE and TIME fields instead of a DATETIME field. Also, a redundant
day of the week field has been introduced. The majority of queries will be for certain
dates at certain times or all times, instead of a time range, so the reasoning behind this
decision is:

`o` Having the day of the week pre-computed will save time when looking for

certain days of the week.

---

`o` Check that the to_g function creates a shape that corresponds to the camera’s

angle of vision area

`o` Check that the to_s function of the shape that is returned gives the correct

string version of that shape.

Another example, for the Floors model:

`o` Check that the image returned by the heatmap() function is as expected,

matching it with one that will be stored.

4.4 WEB APPLICATION

JavascriptMVC comes with FuncUnit, a functional and unit testing framework integrated.

It’s based in QUnit for organizing tests and assertions, but it’s enhanced to allow to open a
webpge, query for elements, simulate user interaction, wait for a condition to be true and get
information about the page and run assertions.

---

3.2.3 SETUP

To setup the filter, follow the steps within the document SVT-Analytics Installation Procedure.

3.2.4 USAGE

The filter waits for a UDP connection. Once it’s made, it sends the head count, along with the
date, time and camera ID, at the desired timing.

Right now, what it does is to send that data once per connection made.

3.3 DATABASE

The database stores data from the cameras at the interval specified in the code but also stores
business-related data: users (credentials), stores, floors, camera location and shape of the area
covered, alarms, dashboard configuration, saved chart queries. It also saves information from
external services: weather, traffic and events (holidays, celebrations, disasters…). The engine

To setup the filter, follow the steps within the document SVT-Analytics Installation Procedure.

3.2.4 USAGE

The filter waits for a UDP connection. Once it’s made, it sends the head count, along with the
date, time and camera ID, at the desired timing.

Right now, what it does is to send that data once per connection made.

3.3 DATABASE

The database stores data from the cameras at the interval specified in the code but also stores
business-related data: users (credentials), stores, floors, camera location and shape of the area
covered, alarms, dashboard configuration, saved chart queries. It also saves information from
external services: weather, traffic and events (holidays, celebrations, disasters…). The engine
where the database is handled is PostgreSQL.

-  JavascriptMVC as a front-end web application framework.

It’s overwhelming the amount of web application frameworks that are out there and the
good reviews that a lot of them receive. It was hard to make a decision on which one to
go for and Backbone.js was really close to being chosen.

The reasons for choosing JavascriptMVC are:

`o` True MVC architecture
`o` Offers great flexibility
`o` Mature
`o` Packs everything into a single Javascript file
`o` Includes scaffolding
`o` Includes factory testing and documentation modules

The first three were the determining reasons for choosing it. Other options were
AngularJS, Ember.js, Dojo, YUI, Kendo UI, Spine and GWT.

Miscellaneous:

---

Configuration of the physical layout of the store (floor names and maps upload, cameras’
location, id and shape, etc…).

matching it with one that will be stored.

4.4 WEB APPLICATION

JavascriptMVC comes with FuncUnit, a functional and unit testing framework integrated.

It’s based in QUnit for organizing tests and assertions, but it’s enhanced to allow to open a
webpge, query for elements, simulate user interaction, wait for a condition to be true and get
information about the page and run assertions.

both the web server and the computer vision system. The cameras send a live stream to the

The physical system is formed by two main sub-networks: inside the SVT Analytics premises
and inside any client premises.

The first one is where the developers have their workstations to work. There is a server and a
database for development purposes and a server and a database for testing. There’s also a
bunch of cameras and a server for computing the headcount on those cameras. This server
fills both the development and testing databases.

The workstations are connected to the internet through a router behind a firewall, for security

3.2.3 SETUP

To setup the filter, follow the steps within the document SVT-Analytics Installation Procedure.

3.2.4 USAGE

The filter waits for a UDP connection. Once it’s made, it sends the head count, along with the
date, time and camera ID, at the desired timing.

Right now, what it does is to send that data once per connection made.

3.3 DATABASE

The database stores data from the cameras at the interval specified in the code but also stores
business-related data: users (credentials), stores, floors, camera location and shape of the area
covered, alarms, dashboard configuration, saved chart queries. It also saves information from
external services: weather, traffic and events (holidays, celebrations, disasters…). The engine

4.4 WEB APPLICATION

JavascriptMVC comes with FuncUnit, a functional and unit testing framework integrated.

It’s based in QUnit for organizing tests and assertions, but it’s enhanced to allow to open a
webpge, query for elements, simulate user interaction, wait for a condition to be true and get
information about the page and run assertions.

---

-  Scaffolding: from the Wikipedia «auto-generated code that the application can use to
create, read, update and delete database entries, effectively treating the template as a
""scaffold"" on which to build a more powerful application»

-  Javascript: (originally) web-browser interpreted programming language for enhancing
web sites in a dynamic way.

-  Ruby: dynamic, object-oriented programming language

-  SQL injection: the typing of SQL statements in user-input fields with the purpose of
messing with the database, gaining access or obtaining private information.

Acronym list:

-  SAD: Software Architecture Document.

-  POS: Point of Sale, the checkout place at any store.

-  REST: Representational State Transfer, web API featuring a state-less client-server
infrastructure.

## 1. INTRODUCTION

Retail companies are constantly adapting to new technologies. The customer experience is key
to succeed and they know it. So they don’t hesitate to place more attractive signs, redesign the
layout, hire nice employees and use soft colors.

Apart from that, the continuous expansion of the digitalization of the information, combined
with cheaper storage and computer infrastructures is directly impacting these companies.

-  Stakeholder: any person involved or affected, directly or indirectly, by this product.

However, the only machine that can be accessed is the web server. The database is filled by
both the web server and the computer vision system. The cameras send a live stream to the
computer vision system.

All the network connections are wired, except the surveillance cameras’ one, which is wireless.
If it’s not feasible to have separate network connections between servers that don’t need to be
connected, it’s possible to join them in a single network but the server should be in a separate
one that has access to the Internet. Inside the SVT Analytics ideally only the workstations
should have access to the Internet.

---

3.2.3 SETUP

To setup the filter, follow the steps within the document SVT-Analytics Installation Procedure.

3.2.4 USAGE

The filter waits for a UDP connection. Once it’s made, it sends the head count, along with the
date, time and camera ID, at the desired timing.

Right now, what it does is to send that data once per connection made.

3.3 DATABASE

The database stores data from the cameras at the interval specified in the code but also stores
business-related data: users (credentials), stores, floors, camera location and shape of the area
covered, alarms, dashboard configuration, saved chart queries. It also saves information from
external services: weather, traffic and events (holidays, celebrations, disasters…). The engine

Is there any mention of reducing transmitted data to save energy?,"However, the only machine that can be accessed is the web server. The database is filled by

If it’s not feasible to have separate network connections between servers that don’t need to be
connected, it’s possible to join them in a single network but the server should be in a separate
one that has access to the Internet. Inside the SVT Analytics ideally only the workstations
should have access to the Internet.

The physical system is formed by two main sub-networks: inside the SVT Analytics premises
and inside any client premises.

The first one is where the developers have their workstations to work. There is a server and a
database for development purposes and a server and a database for testing. There’s also a
bunch of cameras and a server for computing the headcount on those cameras. This server
fills both the development and testing databases.

The workstations are connected to the internet through a router behind a firewall, for security
concerns. Inside the company premises there’s the same entry configuration.

---

Miscellaneous:

-  JSON to transmit data between server and web application, instead of XML: JSON takes
up less space, it’s much easier to build both manually and from an object in memory
and it’s human-readable. Also, No-SQL databases quickly output JSON, as it’s usually the
way things are stored in such kind of engines.

-  Storing date and timestamp for each head count of each camera was decided to be
separate in two DATE and TIME fields instead of a DATETIME field. Also, a redundant
day of the week field has been introduced. The majority of queries will be for certain
dates at certain times or all times, instead of a time range, so the reasoning behind this
decision is:

`o` Having the day of the week pre-computed will save time when looking for

certain days of the week.

---

3.2.3 SETUP

To setup the filter, follow the steps within the document SVT-Analytics Installation Procedure.

3.2.4 USAGE

The filter waits for a UDP connection. Once it’s made, it sends the head count, along with the
date, time and camera ID, at the desired timing.

Right now, what it does is to send that data once per connection made.

3.3 DATABASE

The database stores data from the cameras at the interval specified in the code but also stores
business-related data: users (credentials), stores, floors, camera location and shape of the area
covered, alarms, dashboard configuration, saved chart queries. It also saves information from
external services: weather, traffic and events (holidays, celebrations, disasters…). The engine
where the database is handled is PostgreSQL.

---

`o` Check that the to_g function creates a shape that corresponds to the camera’s

angle of vision area

`o` Check that the to_s function of the shape that is returned gives the correct

string version of that shape.

Another example, for the Floors model:

`o` Check that the image returned by the heatmap() function is as expected,

matching it with one that will be stored.

The database stores data from the cameras at the interval specified in the code but also stores
business-related data: users (credentials), stores, floors, camera location and shape of the area
covered, alarms, dashboard configuration, saved chart queries. It also saves information from
external services: weather, traffic and events (holidays, celebrations, disasters…). The engine
where the database is handled is PostgreSQL.

-  JavascriptMVC as a front-end web application framework.

It’s overwhelming the amount of web application frameworks that are out there and the
good reviews that a lot of them receive. It was hard to make a decision on which one to
go for and Backbone.js was really close to being chosen.

The reasons for choosing JavascriptMVC are:

`o` True MVC architecture
`o` Offers great flexibility
`o` Mature
`o` Packs everything into a single Javascript file
`o` Includes scaffolding
`o` Includes factory testing and documentation modules

AngularJS, Ember.js, Dojo, YUI, Kendo UI, Spine and GWT.

* There is a mention of alarms and notifications, which could suggest that the application is designed to handle a certain level of user activity.
* The document also mentions the importance of good community support, manuals, tutorials, and examples, which could indicate that the framework is designed to be extensible and adaptable to changing user demand.

3.2.3 SETUP

To setup the filter, follow the steps within the document SVT-Analytics Installation Procedure.

3.2.4 USAGE

The filter waits for a UDP connection. Once it’s made, it sends the head count, along with the
date, time and camera ID, at the desired timing.

Right now, what it does is to send that data once per connection made.

3.3 DATABASE

The database stores data from the cameras at the interval specified in the code but also stores
business-related data: users (credentials), stores, floors, camera location and shape of the area
covered, alarms, dashboard configuration, saved chart queries. It also saves information from
external services: weather, traffic and events (holidays, celebrations, disasters…). The engine
where the database is handled is PostgreSQL.

---

However, the only machine that can be accessed is the web server. The database is filled by
both the web server and the computer vision system. The cameras send a live stream to the
computer vision system.

All the network connections are wired, except the surveillance cameras’ one, which is wireless.

The physical system is formed by two main sub-networks: inside the SVT Analytics premises
and inside any client premises.

The first one is where the developers have their workstations to work. There is a server and a
database for development purposes and a server and a database for testing. There’s also a
bunch of cameras and a server for computing the headcount on those cameras. This server
fills both the development and testing databases.

The workstations are connected to the internet through a router behind a firewall, for security

The physical system is formed by two main sub-networks: inside the SVT Analytics premises
and inside any client premises.

The first one is where the developers have their workstations to work. There is a server and a
database for development purposes and a server and a database for testing. There’s also a
bunch of cameras and a server for computing the headcount on those cameras. This server
fills both the development and testing databases.

The workstations are connected to the internet through a router behind a firewall, for security
concerns. Inside the company premises there’s the same entry configuration.

---

3.2.3 SETUP

To setup the filter, follow the steps within the document SVT-Analytics Installation Procedure.

3.2.4 USAGE

The filter waits for a UDP connection. Once it’s made, it sends the head count, along with the
date, time and camera ID, at the desired timing.

Right now, what it does is to send that data once per connection made.

3.3 DATABASE

The database stores data from the cameras at the interval specified in the code but also stores
business-related data: users (credentials), stores, floors, camera location and shape of the area
covered, alarms, dashboard configuration, saved chart queries. It also saves information from
external services: weather, traffic and events (holidays, celebrations, disasters…). The engine
where the database is handled is PostgreSQL.",4.7161524295806885,"Based on the provided context, there is no mention of setting storage retention policies to automatically clean up old data. Therefore, the answer is:

3.2.3 SETUP

To setup the filter, follow the steps within the document SVT-Analytics Installation Procedure.

3.2.4 USAGE

The filter waits for a UDP connection. Once it’s made, it sends the head count, along with the
date, time and camera ID, at the desired timing.

Right now, what it does is to send that data once per connection made.

3.3 DATABASE

The database stores data from the cameras at the interval specified in the code but also stores
business-related data: users (credentials), stores, floors, camera location and shape of the area
covered, alarms, dashboard configuration, saved chart queries. It also saves information from
external services: weather, traffic and events (holidays, celebrations, disasters…). The engine
where the database is handled is PostgreSQL.

---

`o` Check that the to_g function creates a shape that corresponds to the camera’s

angle of vision area

`o` Check that the to_s function of the shape that is returned gives the correct

string version of that shape.

Another example, for the Floors model:

`o` Check that the image returned by the heatmap() function is as expected,

matching it with one that will be stored.

4.4 WEB APPLICATION

JavascriptMVC comes with FuncUnit, a functional and unit testing framework integrated.

It’s based in QUnit for organizing tests and assertions, but it’s enhanced to allow to open a
webpge, query for elements, simulate user interaction, wait for a condition to be true and get
information about the page and run assertions.

---

Configuration of the physical layout of the store (floor names and maps upload, cameras’
location, id and shape, etc…).

Page | 17


-----

Step-by-step wizard for the creation of charts and option to save the results.

Separated options and functionality per store.

Alarms section, with options for setting up alarms based on amount of people in a certain area
(and others to specify), and with actions to take (send email, send text message). A visual
notification when browsing the website is always shown.

Review section to display a history of alarms that went off, periods of time with people on
certain areas (or without people in certain areas), and more.

When a request is made and fails, it’s retried multiple times and finally a popup is shown asking
to retry before continuing.

## 2. ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW

This document is the first approach to present the information of this project in a structured
fashion and discuss its architecture. It also provides guidelines for the upcoming half-to-a-year
development.

Whenever possible, we make use of existing technology instead of reinventing the wheel and
the usability of the system is taken into account as the #1 priority.

The structure that the rest of the document will follow is:

1. A summarized description of the software architecture, including major components

and their interactions.

3.2.3 SETUP

To setup the filter, follow the steps within the document SVT-Analytics Installation Procedure.

3.2.4 USAGE

The filter waits for a UDP connection. Once it’s made, it sends the head count, along with the
date, time and camera ID, at the desired timing.

Right now, what it does is to send that data once per connection made.

3.3 DATABASE

The database stores data from the cameras at the interval specified in the code but also stores
business-related data: users (credentials), stores, floors, camera location and shape of the area
covered, alarms, dashboard configuration, saved chart queries. It also saves information from
external services: weather, traffic and events (holidays, celebrations, disasters…). The engine

-  PostgreSQL as the database management system.

Initially we were using MySQL but after some research, MySQL was clearly not the best
open-source solution. Other popular solutions are Oracle and SQL server, both not free
solutions.
The reasons for choosing PostgreSQL are:

`o` Free
`o` Actively developed
`o` Geometry type support included
`o` Excels at workloads with a significant write workload (which is our case)
`o` Advanced Query Optimizer based on cost, with many plan choices and adaptive

statistics

`o` 5 different kinds of index
`o` Compresses/Decompresses data on the fly, reducing I/O time
`o` Asynchronous support

---

So, with FuncUnit you can open the browser and run the tests or you can run the browser
automation tools that it comes with, through the command line: Selenium and PhantomJS.

What it fails at is checking the actual visual appearance to the user, the exact layout on the
screen; I guess that’s something that only humans can do.

Some of the tests that could be run:

-  Check that it’s possible to log in with a testing account

-  Check that it fails to log in with wrong credentials

-  Check that the dashboard appears with the desired elements in it

-  Check for the account menu list

-  Check that the system logs out correctly

-  Check for all the menu elements

-  Check that they can be clicked and the content loads

-  All the tables exist

-  Definition of each table is as expected

It would also be interesting to test insert, updates, deletes and selects encapsulating them in
transactions and rolling back at the end, instead of committing.

RSpec allows writing more thorough test suites, but based on the views that it generates, which
is not what we are looking for since the views here are at the web application side.

## 2. ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW

This document is the first approach to present the information of this project in a structured
fashion and discuss its architecture. It also provides guidelines for the upcoming half-to-a-year
development.

Whenever possible, we make use of existing technology instead of reinventing the wheel and
the usability of the system is taken into account as the #1 priority.

The structure that the rest of the document will follow is:

1. A summarized description of the software architecture, including major components

and their interactions.

---

3.2.3 SETUP

To setup the filter, follow the steps within the document SVT-Analytics Installation Procedure.

3.2.4 USAGE

The filter waits for a UDP connection. Once it’s made, it sends the head count, along with the
date, time and camera ID, at the desired timing.

Right now, what it does is to send that data once per connection made.

3.3 DATABASE

The database stores data from the cameras at the interval specified in the code but also stores
business-related data: users (credentials), stores, floors, camera location and shape of the area
covered, alarms, dashboard configuration, saved chart queries. It also saves information from
external services: weather, traffic and events (holidays, celebrations, disasters…). The engine
where the database is handled is PostgreSQL.

---

Thus, it is highly encouraged at least one future revision of the document to correct
inaccuracies, extend it and insert additional feedback and decisions that were made in the
past.

I’m curious about whether you are reading the whole document. Please, let me know if you
read this.

With these considerations in mind, this document has been made as accurate as possible, and
as any developer-made artifact, it naturally contains a few, evident jokes to make the reader
smile.

1. 3 GLOSSARY AND ACRONYM LIST

Term list:

-  Stakeholder: any person involved or affected, directly or indirectly, by this product.

---

`o` Check that the to_g function creates a shape that corresponds to the camera’s

angle of vision area

`o` Check that the to_s function of the shape that is returned gives the correct

string version of that shape.

Another example, for the Floors model:

`o` Check that the image returned by the heatmap() function is as expected,

matching it with one that will be stored.

4.4 WEB APPLICATION

JavascriptMVC comes with FuncUnit, a functional and unit testing framework integrated.

It’s based in QUnit for organizing tests and assertions, but it’s enhanced to allow to open a
webpge, query for elements, simulate user interaction, wait for a condition to be true and get
information about the page and run assertions.

---

`o` Good reviews that I’ve received from trusted colleagues.
`o` Good reviews on the Internet.
`o` Good community support, a lot of manuals, tutorials and examples.
`o` Twitter, Groupon, GitHub, Yellow Pages, Shopify, Mingle2, Soundcloud,

Kongregate and tons of other sites use it.

-----

`o` Great support for No-SQL databases, and as mentioned before, it will be a good

idea to research and eventually switch to them.

`o` Includes scaffolding and creates REST APIs out of the box.
`o` Ruby is good for processing data.
`o` Great tools for developing.

-  JavascriptMVC as a front-end web application framework.

## 2. ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW

This document is the first approach to present the information of this project in a structured
fashion and discuss its architecture. It also provides guidelines for the upcoming half-to-a-year
development.

Whenever possible, we make use of existing technology instead of reinventing the wheel and
the usability of the system is taken into account as the #1 priority.

The structure that the rest of the document will follow is:

1. A summarized description of the software architecture, including major components

and their interactions.

-  Scaffolding: from the Wikipedia «auto-generated code that the application can use to
create, read, update and delete database entries, effectively treating the template as a
""scaffold"" on which to build a more powerful application»

-  Javascript: (originally) web-browser interpreted programming language for enhancing
web sites in a dynamic way.

-  Ruby: dynamic, object-oriented programming language

-  SQL injection: the typing of SQL statements in user-input fields with the purpose of
messing with the database, gaining access or obtaining private information.

Acronym list:

-  SAD: Software Architecture Document.

-  POS: Point of Sale, the checkout place at any store.

infrastructure.",4.760791778564453,"Based on the provided context, the answer to the question ""Is there any information on software optimization for performance and efficiency to reduce computational load and energy consumption?"" is:

Yes.

The document mentions several times the importance of optimizing the software for performance and efficiency, and how it will be a good idea to research and eventually switch to No-SQL databases, which are known for their efficiency in handling large amounts of data. Additionally, the document highlights the use of scaffolding and REST APIs as ways to improve the performance of the system.
