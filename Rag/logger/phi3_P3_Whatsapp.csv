Is there any mention of minimizing the total number of deployed environments?,"The responsibility of each of these servers is to provide a port to every online user. The mapping between servers, ports, and users is stored in the WebSocket manager that resides on top of a cluster of the data store. In this case, that’s Redis.

2. Send or receive messages
The WebSocket manager is responsible for maintaining a mapping between an active user and a port assigned to the user. Whenever a user is connected to another WebSocket server, this information will be updated in the data store. A WebSocket server also communicates with another service called message service.

For 30 days, the storage capacity would become the following:
30∗10 TB/day = 300 TB/month

API Design
Send message
sendMessage(message_ID, sender_ID, reciever_ID, type, text=none, media_object=none, document=none)

Approach to achieve the below system attributes
Non-functional Requirements

Approaches

Minimizing latency

Geographically distributed cache management systems and servers
CDNs
Consistency

Provide unique IDs to messages using Sequencer or other mechanisms
Use FIFO messaging queue with strict ordering
Availability

Provide multiple WebSocket servers and managers to establish connections between users
Replication of messages and data associated with users and groups on different servers
Follow disaster recovery protocols
Security

Via end-to-end encryption
Scalability

Performance tuning of servers
Horizontal scalability of services

The following steps describe the communication between both clients:

User A and user B create a communication channel with the chat server.
User A sends a message to the chat server.
Upon receiving the message, the chat server acknowledges back to user A.
The chat server sends the message to user B and stores the message in the database if the receiver’s status is offline.
User B sends an acknowledgment to the chat server.
The chat server notifies user A that the message has been successfully delivered.
When user B reads the message, the application notifies the chat server.
The chat server notifies user A that user B has read the message.
