Does the application/framework use content delivery networks (CDNs) to minimize recomputation or fetching of static data?,"Snapshotting Operator State #
When operators contain any form of state, this state must be part of the snapshots as well.

---

In case of a program failure (due to machine-, network-, or software failure), Flink stops the distributed streaming dataflow. The system then restarts the operators and resets them to the latest successful checkpoint. The input streams are reset to the point of the state snapshot. Any records that are processed as part of the restarted parallel dataflow are guaranteed to not have affected the previously checkpointed state.

---

Finally, the operator writes the state asynchronously to the state backend.
Note that the alignment is needed for all operators with multiple inputs and for operators after a shuffle when they consume output streams of multiple upstream subtasks.

Cluster Lifecycle: in a Flink Job Cluster, the available cluster manager (like YARN) is used to spin up a cluster for each submitted job and this cluster is available to that job only. Here, the client first requests resources from the cluster manager to start the JobManager and submits the job to the Dispatcher running inside this process. TaskManagers are then lazily allocated based on the resource requirements of the job. Once the job is finished, the Flink Job Cluster is torn down.

Explanation: The context does not mention anything about using CDNs for static data in any part of the system. It only discusses state snapshots, checkpoints, and resource management within Flink clusters. Content delivery networks are also known as caching mechanisms or edge servers to reduce latency by bringing content closer to users; these aspects aren't discussed here.

Cluster Lifecycle: in a Flink Job Cluster, the available cluster manager (like YARN) is used to spin up a cluster for each submitted job and this cluster is available to that job only. Here, the client first requests resources from the cluster manager to start the JobManager and submits the job to the Dispatcher running inside this process. TaskManagers are then lazily allocated based on the resource requirements of the job. Once the job is finished, the Flink Job Cluster is torn down.

---

In case of a program failure (due to machine-, network-, or software failure), Flink stops the distributed streaming dataflow. The system then restarts the operators and resets them to the latest successful checkpoint. The input streams are reset to the point of the state snapshot. Any records that are processed as part of the restarted parallel dataflow are guaranteed to not have affected the previously checkpointed state.

---

Finally, the operator writes the state asynchronously to the state backend.
Note that the alignment is needed for all operators with multiple inputs and for operators after a shuffle when they consume output streams of multiple upstream subtasks.

Unaligned checkpointing ensures that barriers are arriving at the sink as fast as possible. It’s especially suited for applications with at least one slow moving data path, where alignment times can reach hours. However, since it’s adding additional I/O pressure, it doesn’t help when the I/O to the state backends is the bottleneck. See the more in-depth discussion in ops for other limitations.

Note that savepoints will always be aligned.

Unaligned checkpointing ensures that barriers are arriving at the sink as fast as possible. It’s especially suited for applications with at least one slow moving data path, where alignment times can reach hours.

Cluster Lifecycle: in a Flink Job Cluster, the available cluster manager (like YARN) is used to spin up a cluster for each submitted job and this cluster is available to that job only. Here, the client first requests resources from the cluster manager to start the JobManager and submits the job to the Dispatcher running inside this process.
