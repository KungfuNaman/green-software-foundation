Is there any mention of queuing non-urgent processing requests,"Approach to achieve the below system attributes
Non-functional Requirements

Approaches

Minimizing latency

Geographically distributed cache management systems and servers
CDNs
Consistency

Provide unique IDs to messages using Sequencer or other mechanisms
Use FIFO messaging queue with strict ordering
Availability

Provide multiple WebSocket servers and managers to establish connections between users
Replication of messages and data associated with users and groups on different servers
Follow disaster recovery protocols
Security

Via end-to-end encryption
Scalability

Performance tuning of servers
Horizontal scalability of services

---

Consistency: Messages should be delivered in the order they were sent.
Availability: The system should be highly available. However, the availability can be compromised in the interest of consistency.
Security: The system must be secure via end-to-end encryption. The end-to-end encryption ensures that only the two communicating parties can see the content of messages. Nobody in between, not even WhatsApp, should have access.
Scalability: The system should be highly scalable to support an ever-increasing number of users and messages per day.
Capacity Estimation
Storage Estimation:
100 billion messages are shared through WhatsApp per day and each message takes 100 bytes on average
100 billion/day∗100 Bytes = 10 TB/day
For 30 days, the storage capacity would become the following:

---

users: This table will contain a user’s information such as name, phoneNumber, and other details.
messages: This table will store messages with properties such as type (text, image, video, etc.), content, and timestamps for message delivery. The message will also have a corresponding chatID or groupID.
chats: This table basically represents a private chat between two users and can contain multiple messages.
users_chats: This table maps users and chats as multiple users can have multiple chats (N:M relationship) and vice versa.
groups: This table represents a group between multiple users.
users_groups: This table maps users and groups as multiple users can be a part of multiple groups (N:M relationship) and vice versa.

Send message

Message service is a repository of messages on top of the Mnesia database cluster. It acts as an interface to the Mnesia database for other services interacting with the databases. It is responsible for storing and retrieving messages from the Mnesia database. It also deletes messages from the Mnesia database after a configurable amount of time. And, it exposes APIs to receive messages by various filters, such as user ID, message ID, and so on.

3. Send or receive media files
We have another service called the asset service, which is responsible for sending and receiving media files.

1. Connection with Websocket Server
In WhatsApp, each active device is connected with a WebSocket server via WebSocket protocol. A WebSocket server keeps the connection open with all the active (online) users. Since one server isn’t enough to handle billions of devices, there should be enough servers to handle billions of users.

Functional Requirement
Conversation: The system should support one-on-one and group conversations between users.
Acknowledgment: The system should support message delivery acknowledgment, such as sent, delivered, and read.
Sharing: The system should support sharing of media files, such as images, videos, and audio.
Chat storage: The system must support the persistent storage of chat messages when a user is offline until the successful delivery of messages.
Push notifications: The system should be able to notify offline users of new messages once their status becomes online.
Non-Functional Requirement
Low latency: Users should be able to receive messages with low latency.
Consistency: Messages should be delivered in the order they were sent.

4. Support for Group messages
Since user A is connected to a WebSocket server, it sends a message to the message service intended for Group A.The message service sends the message to Kafka with other specific information about the group. The message is saved there for further processing. In Kafka terminology, a group can be a topic, and the senders and receivers can be producers and consumers, respectively.

It has all the information about each group, including user IDs, group ID, status, group icon, number of users, and so on. This service resides on top of the MySQL database cluster, with multiple secondary replicas distributed geographically. A Redis cache server also exists to cache data from the MySQL servers. Both geographically distributed replicas and Redis cache aid in reducing latency.

The group message handler communicates with the group service to retrieve data of Group/A users. In the last step, the group message handler follows the same process as a WebSocket server and delivers the message to each user.

Message service is a repository of messages on top of the Mnesia database cluster. It acts as an interface to the Mnesia database for other services interacting with the databases. It is responsible for storing and retrieving messages from the Mnesia database. It also deletes messages from the Mnesia database after a configurable amount of time. And, it exposes APIs to receive messages by various filters, such as user ID, message ID, and so on.

3. Send or receive media files
We have another service called the asset service, which is responsible for sending and receiving media files.

The following steps describe the communication between both clients:

User A and user B create a communication channel with the chat server.
User A sends a message to the chat server.
Upon receiving the message, the chat server acknowledges back to user A.
The chat server sends the message to user B and stores the message in the database if the receiver’s status is offline.
User B sends an acknowledgment to the chat server.
The chat server notifies user A that the message has been successfully delivered.

This API is used to send a text message from a sender to a receiver by making a POST API call to the /messages API endpoint. Generally, the sender’s and receiver’s IDs are their phone numbers.

Get Message
getMessage(user_Id)

Using this API call, users can fetch all unread messages when they come online after being offline for some time.

Upload File
uploadFile(file_type, file)

We can upload media files via the uploadFile API by making a POST request to the /v1/media API endpoint. A successful response returns an ID that’s forwarded to the receiver.

This API is used to send a text message from a sender to a receiver by making a POST API call to the /messages API endpoint. Generally, the sender’s and receiver’s IDs are their phone numbers.

Get Message
getMessage(user_Id)

Using this API call, users can fetch all unread messages when they come online after being offline for some time.

Upload File
uploadFile(file_type, file)

We can upload media files via the uploadFile API by making a POST request to the /v1/media API endpoint. A successful response returns an ID that’s forwarded to the receiver.

Download Media File

This API is used to send a text message from a sender to a receiver by making a POST API call to the /messages API endpoint. Generally, the sender’s and receiver’s IDs are their phone numbers.

Get Message
getMessage(user_Id)

Using this API call, users can fetch all unread messages when they come online after being offline for some time.

Upload File
uploadFile(file_type, file)

We can upload media files via the uploadFile API by making a POST request to the /v1/media API endpoint. A successful response returns an ID that’s forwarded to the receiver.

Download Media File
downloadFile(user_id, file_id)

Architecture
We will be using microservices architecture since it will make it easier to horizontally scale and decouple our services. Each service will have ownership of its own data model.

Low Level Design (LLD) of System Design
Low-Level-Design(LLD)-of-WhatsApp-Messenger

1. Connection with Websocket Server
In WhatsApp, each active device is connected with a WebSocket server via WebSocket protocol. A WebSocket server keeps the connection open with all the active (online) users. Since one server isn’t enough to handle billions of devices, there should be enough servers to handle billions of users.

---

4. Support for Group messages
Since user A is connected to a WebSocket server, it sends a message to the message service intended for Group A.The message service sends the message to Kafka with other specific information about the group. The message is saved there for further processing. In Kafka terminology, a group can be a topic, and the senders and receivers can be producers and consumers, respectively.
