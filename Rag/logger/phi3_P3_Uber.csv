Is there any mention of minimizing the total number of deployed environments?,"Supply sends the request to the specific server based on the GPS location data. After that, the system draws the circle and filters out all the nearby cabs which meet the rider’s requirements.
After that, the list of the cab is sent to the ETA to calculate the distance between the rider and the cab, not geographically but by the road system.
The sorted ETA is then sent back to the supply system to offer to a driver.
If we need to handle the traffic for the newly added city then we can increase the number of servers and allocate the responsibilities of newly added cities’ cell IDs to these servers.

It maintains consistent hashing to assign the work across the workers. It helps in sharding the application in a way that’s scalable and fault-tolerant.
Ringpop uses RPC (Remote Procedure Call) protocol to make calls from one server to another server.
Ringpop also uses a SWIM membership protocol/gossip protocol that allows independent workers to discover each other’s responsibilities. This way each server/node knows the responsibility and the work of other nodes.
Ringpop detects the newly added nodes to the cluster and the node which is removed from the cluster. It distributes the loads evenly when a node is added or removed.

Kafka takes historical data along with real-time data. Data is archived into Hadoop before it expires from Kafka. The data is also indexed into an Elastic search stack for searching and visualizations. Elastic search does some log analysis using Kibana/Graphana. Some of the analyses performed by Uber using different tools and frameworks are…

1. Trace coverage
Trace coverage spot the missing road segments or incorrect road geometry.
Trace coverage calculation is based on two inputs: map data under testing and historic GPS traces of all Uber rides taken over a certain period of time.
It covers those GPS traces onto the map, comparing and matching them with road segments.
If we find missing road segments (no road is shown) on GPS traces then we take some steps to fix the deficiency. 
2. Preferred access (pick-up) point accuracy

Important Topics for the System Design of Uber App

Requirements
Capacity Estimation
Uber App Low-Level Design
High-Level Design of Uber App
1. Requirements
1.1 Functional requirements
Users should be able to see all the cabs available with minimum price and ETA
Users should be able to book a cab for their destination
Users should be able to see the location of the driver
Users should be able to cancel their ride whenever they want
1.2 Non-Functional requirements
High Availability
High Reliability
Highly Scalable
Low Latency
2. Capacity Estimation
Lets assume we have 5 million active users on our application with 200,000 drivers and on an average there are 1 million rides daily. If a user performs 5 actions on an average then we need to handle 5 million requests daily",8.546781778335571," Response: No
Judgement Explanation not applicable as no information about deploying or environment deployment is provided in context. The focus seems more on handling capacity and scalability within a city's server infrastructure, rather than reducing environmental footprint through fewer servers/deployments specifically for minimizing the total number of deployed environments mentioned anywhere else besides general system design considerations like high availability which doesn’t directly imply about deploying or not.",10.179203271865845,0,"[Document(page_content='Supply sends the request to the specific server based on the GPS location data.
