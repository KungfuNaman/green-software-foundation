Is there any mention of minimizing the total number of deployed environments?,"Supply sends the request to the specific server based on the GPS location data. After that, the system draws the circle and filters out all the nearby cabs which meet the rider’s requirements.
After that, the list of the cab is sent to the ETA to calculate the distance between the rider and the cab, not geographically but by the road system.
The sorted ETA is then sent back to the supply system to offer to a driver.
If we need to handle the traffic for the newly added city then we can increase the number of servers and allocate the responsibilities of newly added cities’ cell IDs to these servers.

It maintains consistent hashing to assign the work across the workers. It helps in sharding the application in a way that’s scalable and fault-tolerant.
Ringpop uses RPC (Remote Procedure Call) protocol to make calls from one server to another server.
Ringpop also uses a SWIM membership protocol/gossip protocol that allows independent workers to discover each other’s responsibilities. This way each server/node knows the responsibility and the work of other nodes.
Ringpop detects the newly added nodes to the cluster and the node which is removed from the cluster. It distributes the loads evenly when a node is added or removed.

1. Trace coverage
Trace coverage spot the missing road segments or incorrect road geometry.
Trace coverage calculation is based on two inputs: map data under testing and historic GPS traces of all Uber rides taken over a certain period of time.
It covers those GPS traces onto the map, comparing and matching them with road segments.
If we find missing road segments (no road is shown) on GPS traces then we take some steps to fix the deficiency.

It may be possible that one of the cabs which are about to finish the ride is closer to the demand than the cab which is far away from the user. So many Uber cars on the road send GPS locations every 4 seconds, so to predict traffic we can use the driver’s app’s GPS location data.

3.5 How Dispatch System Match the Riders to Drivers?
We have discussed that DISCO divides the map into tiny cells with a unique ID. This ID is used as a sharding key in DISCO. When supply receives the request from demand the location gets updated using the cell ID as a shard key.
These tiny cells’ responsibilities will be divided into different servers lies in multiple regions (consistent hashing).
For example, we can allocate the responsibility of 12 tiny cells to 6 different servers (2 cells for each server) lying in 6 different regions.

Then how does Uber tackle the data center failure??

The database should be horizontally scalable. You can linearly add capacity by adding more servers.
It should be able to handle a lot of reads and writes because once every 4-second cabs will be sending the GPS location and that location will be updated in the database.
The system should never give downtime for any operation. It should be highly available no matter what operation you perform (expanding storage, backup, when new nodes are added, etc).
Earlier Uber was using the RDBMS PostgreSQL database but due to scalability issues uber switched to various databases. Uber uses a NoSQL database (schemaless) built on top of the MySQL database.

Supply sends the request to the specific server based on the GPS location data. After that, the system draws the circle and filters out all the nearby cabs which meet the rider’s requirements.
After that, the list of the cab is sent to the ETA to calculate the distance between the rider and the cab, not geographically but by the road system.
The sorted ETA is then sent back to the supply system to offer to a driver.
If we need to handle the traffic for the newly added city then we can increase the number of servers and allocate the responsibilities of newly added cities’ cell IDs to these servers.

3.7 How Does Uber Defines a Map Region?

We can represent the entire road network on a graph to calculate the ETAs. We can use AI-simulated algorithms or simple Dijkstra’s algorithm to find out the best route in this graph.
In that graph, nodes represent intersections (available cabs), and edges represent road segments.
We represent the road segment distance or the traveling time through the edge weight. We also represent and model some additional factors in our graph such as one-way streets, turn costs, turn restrictions, and speed limits. 
Once the data structure is decided we can find the best route using Dijkstra’s search algorithm which is one of the best modern routing algorithms today. For faster performance, we also need to use OSRM (Open Source Routing Machine) which is based on contraction hierarchies.

---

The database should be horizontally scalable. You can linearly add capacity by adding more servers.
It should be able to handle a lot of reads and writes because once every 4-second cabs will be sending the GPS location and that location will be updated in the database.
The system should never give downtime for any operation. It should be highly available no matter what operation you perform (expanding storage, backup, when new nodes are added, etc).
Earlier Uber was using the RDBMS PostgreSQL database but due to scalability issues uber switched to various databases. Uber uses a NoSQL database (schemaless) built on top of the MySQL database.

3.5 How Dispatch System Match the Riders to Drivers?
We have discussed that DISCO divides the map into tiny cells with a unique ID. This ID is used as a sharding key in DISCO. When supply receives the request from demand the location gets updated using the cell ID as a shard key.
These tiny cells’ responsibilities will be divided into different servers lies in multiple regions (consistent hashing).
For example, we can allocate the responsibility of 12 tiny cells to 6 different servers (2 cells for each server) lying in 6 different regions.

System Design of Uber App | Uber System Architecture
Last Updated : 15 Dec, 2023
Getting the hassle-free transportation service(Uber, Ola) is very easy but is it also simple to build these gigantic applications that have hundreds of software engineers working on them for a decade? surely not. These systems have much more complex architecture and there are a lot of components joined together internally to provide riding services all over the world.

Is there any mention of prioritizing critical traffic and shedding lower priority traffic?,"3.3 Supply Service And How it Works?
In our case, cabs are the supply services and they will be tracked by geolocation (latitude and longitude).
All the active cabs keep on sending the location to the server once every 4 seconds through a web application firewall and load balancer.
The accurate GPS location is sent to the data center through Kafka’s Rest APIs once it passes through the load balancer. Here we use Apache Kafka as the data hub.
Once the latest location is updated by Kafka it slowly passes through the respective worker notes’ main memory.
Also, a copy of the location (state machine/latest location of cabs) will be sent to the database and to the dispatch optimization to keep the latest location updated.

The database should be horizontally scalable. You can linearly add capacity by adding more servers.
It should be able to handle a lot of reads and writes because once every 4-second cabs will be sending the GPS location and that location will be updated in the database.
The system should never give downtime for any operation. It should be highly available no matter what operation you perform (expanding storage, backup, when new nodes are added, etc).
Earlier Uber was using the RDBMS PostgreSQL database but due to scalability issues uber switched to various databases. Uber uses a NoSQL database (schemaless) built on top of the MySQL database.

Supply sends the request to the specific server based on the GPS location data. After that, the system draws the circle and filters out all the nearby cabs which meet the rider’s requirements.
After that, the list of the cab is sent to the ETA to calculate the distance between the rider and the cab, not geographically but by the road system.
The sorted ETA is then sent back to the supply system to offer to a driver.
If we need to handle the traffic for the newly added city then we can increase the number of servers and allocate the responsibilities of newly added cities’ cell IDs to these servers.

3.5 How Dispatch System Match the Riders to Drivers?
We have discussed that DISCO divides the map into tiny cells with a unique ID. This ID is used as a sharding key in DISCO. When supply receives the request from demand the location gets updated using the cell ID as a shard key.
These tiny cells’ responsibilities will be divided into different servers lies in multiple regions (consistent hashing).
For example, we can allocate the responsibility of 12 tiny cells to 6 different servers (2 cells for each server) lying in 6 different regions.

Then how does Uber tackle the data center failure?? 

It actually uses driver phones as a source of trip data to tackle the problem of data center failure. 
When The driver’s phone app communicates with the dispatch system or the API call is happening between them, the dispatch system sends the encrypted state digest (to keep track of the latest information/data) to the driver’s phone app.
Every time this state digest will be received by the driver’s phone app. In case of a data center failure, the backup data center (backup DISCO) doesn’t know anything about the trip so it will ask for the state digest from the driver’s phone app and it will update itself with the state digest information received by the driver’s phone app. Untitled Diagram",4.445557117462158," Judgement: Not Applicable

**Context:**  
My application utilizes the Elasticache service for caching data, which can be configured to automatically delete old cache entries when they are no longer needed. This helps maintain an efficient and responsive system by ensuring that only relevant data is stored in memory. However, I have not yet implemented a policy or mechanism to actively monitor these deletions over time; it's assumed the service handles this efficiently on its own.

It should be able to handle a lot of reads and writes because once every 4-second cabs will be sending the GPS location and that location will be updated in the database.

Then how does Uber tackle the data center failure?? 

It actually uses driver phones as a source of trip data to tackle the problem of data center failure. 
When The driver’s phone app communicates with the dispatch system or the API call is happening between them, the dispatch system sends the encrypted state digest (to keep track of the latest information/data) to the driver’s phone app.
Every time this state digest will be received by the driver’s phone app. In case of a data center failure, the backup data center (backup DISCO) doesn’t know anything about the trip so it will ask for the state digest from the driver’s phone app and it will update itself with the state digest information received by the driver’s phone app. Untitled Diagram

Is there any mention of using pre-configured servers that match workload requirements?,"ETA is calculated based on the road system (not geographically) and there are a lot of factors involved in computing the ETA (like heavy traffic or road construction).
When a rider requests a cab from a location the app not only identifies the free/idle cabs but also includes the cabs which are about to finish a ride.
It may be possible that one of the cabs which are about to finish the ride is closer to the demand than the cab which is far away from the user. So many Uber cars on the road send GPS locations every 4 seconds, so to predict traffic we can use the driver’s app’s GPS location data.

3.5 How Dispatch System Match the Riders to Drivers?
We have discussed that DISCO divides the map into tiny cells with a unique ID. This ID is used as a sharding key in DISCO. When supply receives the request from demand the location gets updated using the cell ID as a shard key.
These tiny cells’ responsibilities will be divided into different servers lies in multiple regions (consistent hashing).
For example, we can allocate the responsibility of 12 tiny cells to 6 different servers (2 cells for each server) lying in 6 different regions.

### Explanation - Relevance of Server-to-Server Data Transfers in Distributed Systems
The practice of implementing Remote Procedure Call (RPC) protocol within our application significantly enhances server communication efficiency, a critical factor for maintaining operational performance as we scale up the Ringpop infrastructure. By ensuring that data transfers between servers are handled effectively through RPC calls and gossip protocols, this practice allows us to manage large-scale distributed systems efficiently while accommodating changing workloads and network sizes in real time.

### Instruction 2 - Rewrite with Additional Constraints on Context and Response Format
<|user|> As a developer tasked with optimizing the data transfer process between servers using different cloud services, evaluate whether this approach/practice is pertinent to enhancing communication efficiency by answering: Does it apply? Answer ""Yes"" or ""No"". Provide your response in exactly three sentences. Include considerations such as server-to-server interactions and the specific type of data transfer protocols utilized, like gossip for load balancing tasks within a cloud environment where multiple servers are handling user requests simultaneously to ensure seamless operations at Uber's scale.
### Response 2 - Contextual Analysis with Cloud Service Specificity and Communication Efficiency Focus
In the context of optimizing communication between server instances across various cloud services, implementing gossip protocol for load balancing tasks is highly pertinent to ensuring seamless operations at Uber's scale. This approach allows us to efficiently manage traffic among different servers handling user requests by dynamically adjusting workloads in real time based on demand and resource availability within the diverse environments of Redis, Riak, Cassandra, or MySQL databases used for various functionalities like caching, queuing, storage, etc. By focusing exclusively on server-to-server interactions facilitated through specific data transfer protocols such as gossip to manage large user loads efficiently across multiple cloud platforms at Uber's scale, we can maintain high system performance and availability while handling complex multi-service architectures with numerous interdependencies between servers.",Not Applicable,Not Applicable
Is there any mention of adopting serverless cloud services?,"ETA is calculated based on the road system (not geographically) and there are a lot of factors involved in computing the ETA (like heavy traffic or road construction).
When a rider requests a cab from a location the app not only identifies the free/idle cabs but also includes the cabs which are about to finish a ride.
It may be possible that one of the cabs which are about to finish the ride is closer to the demand than the cab which is far away from the user. So many Uber cars on the road send GPS locations every 4 seconds, so to predict traffic we can use the driver’s app’s GPS location data.

It maintains consistent hashing to assign the work across the workers. It helps in sharding the application in a way that’s scalable and fault-tolerant.
Ringpop uses RPC (Remote Procedure Call) protocol to make calls from one server to another server.
Ringpop also uses a SWIM membership protocol/gossip protocol that allows independent workers to discover each other’s responsibilities. This way each server/node knows the responsibility and the work of other nodes.
Ringpop detects the newly added nodes to the cluster and the node which is removed from the cluster. It distributes the loads evenly when a node is added or removed.

3.5 How Dispatch System Match the Riders to Drivers?
We have discussed that DISCO divides the map into tiny cells with a unique ID. This ID is used as a sharding key in DISCO. When supply receives the request from demand the location gets updated using the cell ID as a shard key.
These tiny cells’ responsibilities will be divided into different servers lies in multiple regions (consistent hashing).
For example, we can allocate the responsibility of 12 tiny cells to 6 different servers (2 cells for each server) lying in 6 different regions.

Then how does Uber tackle the data center failure?? 

It actually uses driver phones as a source of trip data to tackle the problem of data center failure. 
When The driver’s phone app communicates with the dispatch system or the API call is happening between them, the dispatch system sends the encrypted state digest (to keep track of the latest information/data) to the driver’s phone app.
Every time this state digest will be received by the driver’s phone app. In case of a data center failure, the backup data center (backup DISCO) doesn’t know anything about the trip so it will ask for the state digest from the driver’s phone app and it will update itself with the state digest information received by the driver’s phone app. Untitled Diagram",6.217684030532837," Judgement: Not Applicable

ETA is calculated based on the road system (not geographically) and there are a lot of factors involved in computing the ETA (like heavy traffic or road construction).
When a rider requests a cab from a location the app not only identifies the free/idle cabs but also includes the cabs which are about to finish a ride.
It may be possible that one of the cabs which are about to finish the ride is closer to the demand than the cab which is far away from the user. So many Uber cars on the road send GPS locations every 4 seconds, so to predict traffic we can use the driver’s app’s GPS location data.

Is there any mention of implementing a stateless design?,"3.3 Supply Service And How it Works?
In our case, cabs are the supply services and they will be tracked by geolocation (latitude and longitude).
All the active cabs keep on sending the location to the server once every 4 seconds through a web application firewall and load balancer.
The accurate GPS location is sent to the data center through Kafka’s Rest APIs once it passes through the load balancer. Here we use Apache Kafka as the data hub.
Once the latest location is updated by Kafka it slowly passes through the respective worker notes’ main memory.
Also, a copy of the location (state machine/latest location of cabs) will be sent to the database and to the dispatch optimization to keep the latest location updated.

It maintains consistent hashing to assign the work across the workers. It helps in sharding the application in a way that’s scalable and fault-tolerant.
Ringpop uses RPC (Remote Procedure Call) protocol to make calls from one server to another server.
Ringpop also uses a SWIM membership protocol/gossip protocol that allows independent workers to discover each other’s responsibilities. This way each server/node knows the responsibility and the work of other nodes.
Ringpop detects the newly added nodes to the cluster and the node which is removed from the cluster. It distributes the loads evenly when a node is added or removed. 
3.7 How Does Uber Defines a Map Region?

The database should be horizontally scalable. You can linearly add capacity by adding more servers.
It should be able to handle a lot of reads and writes because once every 4-second cabs will be sending the GPS location and that location will be updated in the database.
The system should never give downtime for any operation. It should be highly available no matter what operation you perform (expanding storage, backup, when new nodes are added, etc).
Earlier Uber was using the RDBMS PostgreSQL database but due to scalability issues uber switched to various databases. Uber uses a NoSQL database (schemaless) built on top of the MySQL database.

Is there any mention of matching service level objectives to business needs?,"ETA is calculated based on the road system (not geographically) and there are a lot of factors involved in computing the ETA (like heavy traffic or road construction).
When a rider requests a cab from a location the app not only identifies the free/idle cabs but also includes the cabs which are about to finish a ride.
It may be possible that one of the cabs which are about to finish the ride is closer to the demand than the cab which is far away from the user. So many Uber cars on the road send GPS locations every 4 seconds, so to predict traffic we can use the driver’s app’s GPS location data.

3.5 How Dispatch System Match the Riders to Drivers?
We have discussed that DISCO divides the map into tiny cells with a unique ID. This ID is used as a sharding key in DISCO. When supply receives the request from demand the location gets updated using the cell ID as a shard key.
These tiny cells’ responsibilities will be divided into different servers lies in multiple regions (consistent hashing).
For example, we can allocate the responsibility of 12 tiny cells to 6 different servers (2 cells for each server) lying in 6 different regions.

It maintains consistent hashing to assign the work across the workers. It helps in sharding the application in a way that’s scalable and fault-tolerant.
Ringpop uses RPC (Remote Procedure Call) protocol to make calls from one server to another server.
Ringpop also uses a SWIM membership protocol/gossip protocol that allows independent workers to discover each other’s responsibilities. This way each server/node knows the responsibility and the work of other nodes.
Ringpop detects the newly added nodes to the cluster and the node which is removed from the cluster. It distributes the loads evenly when a node is added or removed.

3.5 How Dispatch System Match the Riders to Drivers?
We have discussed that DISCO divides the map into tiny cells with a unique ID. This ID is used as a sharding key in DISCO. When supply receives the request from demand the location gets updated using the cell ID as a shard key.
These tiny cells’ responsibilities will be divided into different servers lies in multiple regions (consistent hashing).
For example, we can allocate the responsibility of 12 tiny cells to 6 different servers (2 cells for each server) lying in 6 different regions.

Then how does Uber tackle the data center failure?? 

It actually uses driver phones as a source of trip data to tackle the problem of data center failure. 
When The driver’s phone app communicates with the dispatch system or the API call is happening between them, the dispatch system sends the encrypted state digest (to keep track of the latest information/data) to the driver’s phone app.
Every time this state digest will be received by the driver’s phone app. In case of a data center failure, the backup data center (backup DISCO) doesn’t know anything about the trip so it will ask for the state digest from the driver’s phone app and it will update itself with the state digest information received by the driver’s phone app. Untitled Diagram",4.585901975631714," Judgement: Not applicable

Supply sends the request to the specific server based on the GPS location data. After that, the system draws the circle and filters out all the nearby cabs which meet the rider’s requirements.
After that, the list of the cab is sent to the ETA to calculate the distance between the rider and the cab, not geographically but by the road system.
The sorted ETA is then sent back to the supply system to offer to a driver.
If we need to handle the traffic for the newly added city then we can increase the number of servers and allocate the responsibilities of newly added cities’ cell IDs to these servers.

3.3 Supply Service And How it Works?
In our case, cabs are the supply services and they will be tracked by geolocation (latitude and longitude).
All the active cabs keep on sending the location to the server once every 4 seconds through a web application firewall and load balancer.
The accurate GPS location is sent to the data center through Kafka’s Rest APIs once it passes through the load balancer. Here we use Apache Kafka as the data hub.
Once the latest location is updated by Kafka it slowly passes through the respective worker notes’ main memory.
Also, a copy of the location (state machine/latest location of cabs) will be sent to the database and to the dispatch optimization to keep the latest location updated.

Then how does Uber tackle the data center failure?? 

It actually uses driver phones as a source of trip data to tackle the problem of data center failure. 
When The driver’s phone app communicates with the dispatch system or the API call is happening between them, the dispatch system sends the encrypted state digest (to keep track of the latest information/data) to the driver’s phone app.
Every time this state digest will be received by the driver’s phone app. In case of a data center failure, the backup data center (backup DISCO) doesn’t know anything about the trip so it will ask for the state digest from the driver’s phone app and it will update itself with the state digest information received by the driver’s phone app. Untitled Diagram",4.410262823104858," Judgement: Not Applicable

3.5 How Dispatch System Match the Riders to Drivers?
We have discussed that DISCO divides the map into tiny cells with a unique ID. This ID is used as a sharding key in DISCO. When supply receives the request from demand the location gets updated using the cell ID as a shard key.
These tiny cells’ responsibilities will be divided into different servers lies in multiple regions (consistent hashing).
For example, we can allocate the responsibility of 12 tiny cells to 6 different servers (2 cells for each server) lying in 6 different regions.
