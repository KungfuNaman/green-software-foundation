8. Database Design for Instagram Database Design
We need the following tables to store our data:

---

Availability: The system should be highly available.
Durability: Any uploaded content (photos and videos) should never get lost.
Consistency: We can compromise a little on consistency. It is acceptable if the content (photos or videos) takes time to show in followers’ feeds located in a distant region.
Reliability: The system must be able to tolerate hardware and software failures.
3. Capacity Estimation for Instagram System Design
We have 1 billion users, with 500 million as daily active users. Assume 60 million photos and 35 million videos are shared on Instagram per day. We can consider 3 MB as the maximum size of each photo and 150 MB as the maximum size of each video uploaded on Instagram.On average, each user sends 20 requests (of any type) per day to our service.

Availability: The system should be highly available.
Durability: Any uploaded content (photos and videos) should never get lost.
Consistency: We can compromise a little on consistency. It is acceptable if the content (photos or videos) takes time to show in followers’ feeds located in a distant region.
Reliability: The system must be able to tolerate hardware and software failures.
3. Capacity Estimation for Instagram System Design
We have 1 billion users, with 500 million as daily active users. Assume 60 million photos and 35 million videos are shared on Instagram per day. We can consider 3 MB as the maximum size of each photo and 150 MB as the maximum size of each video uploaded on Instagram.On average, each user sends 20 requests (of any type) per day to our service.

Health Monitoring and Auto-Scaling Practices in a Microservice Architecture - CloudUpgrade Blog

Context: Many organizations implementing cloud solutions rely on microservices architecture to optimize resource allocation, improve system resilience, reduce complexity, increase scalability, enhance fault tolerance, facilitate continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD), and enable automated scaling. In this setup, each service can be independently scaled based on its real-time load or usage patterns without affecting other services in the application ecosystem.

3.1 Storage Per Day
Photos: 60 million photos/day * 3 MB = 180 TeraBytes / day
Videos: 35 million videos/day * 150 MB = 5250 TB / day
Total content size = 180 + 5250 = 5430 TB
The Total Space required for a Year:
5430 TB/day * 365 (days a year) = 1981950 TB = 1981.95 PetaBytes

3.2 Bandwidth Estimation
5430 TB/(24 * 60* 60) = 5430 TB/86400 sec ~= 62.84 GB/s ~= 502.8 Gbps

10. Scalability for Instagram System Design
Scalability refers to the ability of an organization (or a system, such as a computer network) to perform well under an increased or expanding workload. A system that scales well will be able to maintain or increase its level of performance even as it is tested by larger and larger operational demands.

We can add more servers to application service layers to make the scalability better and handle numerous requests from the clients. We can also increase the number of databases to store the growing users’ data.

3.1 Storage Per Day
Photos: 60 million photos/day * 3 MB = 180 TeraBytes / day
Videos: 35 million videos/day * 150 MB = 5250 TB / day
Total content size = 180 + 5250 = 5430 TB
The Total Space required for a Year:
5430 TB/day * 365 (days a year) = 1981950 TB = 1981.95 PetaBytes

3.2 Bandwidth Estimation
5430 TB/(24 * 60* 60) = 5430 TB/86400 sec ~= 62.84 GB/s ~= 502.8 Gbps

Durability: Any uploaded content (photos and videos) should never get lost.
Consistency: We can compromise a little on consistency. It is acceptable if the content (photos or videos) takes time to show in followers’ feeds located in a distant region.
Reliability: The system must be able to tolerate hardware and software failures.

We have 1 billion users, with 500 million as daily active users. Assume 60 million photos and 35 million videos are shared on Instagram per day. We can consider 3 MB as the maximum size of each photo and 150 MB as the maximum size of each video uploaded on Instagram.On average, each user sends 20 requests (of any type) per day to our service.

3.1 Storage Per Day
Photos: 60 million photos/day * 3 MB = 180 TeraBytes / day
Videos: 35 million videos/day * 150 MB = 5250 TB / day
Total content size = 180 + 5250 = 5430 TB
The Total Space required for a Year:
5430 TB/day * 365 (days a year) = 1981950 TB = 1981.95 PetaBytes

3.2 Bandwidth Estimation
5430 TB/(24 * 60* 60) = 5430 TB/86400 sec ~= 62.84 GB/s ~= 502.8 Gbps
Incoming bandwidth ~= 502.8 Gbps
Let’s say the ratio of readers to writers is 100:1.
Required outgoing bandwidth ~= 100 * 502.8 Gbps ~= 50.28 Tbps

10. Scalability for Instagram System Design
Scalability refers to the ability of an organization (or a system, such as a computer network) to perform well under an increased or expanding workload. A system that scales well will be able to maintain or increase its level of performance even as it is tested by larger and larger operational demands.

We can add more servers to application service layers to make the scalability better and handle numerous requests from the clients. We can also increase the number of databases to store the growing users’ data.

Explan ### Instruction to Reconstruct Textbook Section on Green Information Systems (GIS) and Their Benefits, Challenges & Design Principles

1. **Constraint on Topic** - The content must focus exclusively on the benefits of GIS in improving system performance through resource efficiency such as lower energy consumption or reduced power usage devices require compared to traditional methods like physical data centers (PDCs). Specifically, mention how leveraging cloud-based solutions can lead to significant reductions.
   
2. **Constraint on Knowledge Point** - Include a section that explains the concept of 'Low Power/Area Tradeoff', emphasizing its role in achieving energy efficiency and minimized power usage for applications like AI, ML models, or IoT devices when compared to PDCs. This should be based upon principles such as reducing computational loads by offloading tasks from on-device components to cloud infrastructures where possible (e.g., using serverless computing).
   
3. **Constraint on Real-world Examples** - Discuss how the adoption of GIS in critical systems like those used for emergency response or smart cities can enhance system performance and reliability, providing examples such as traffic control during peak hours to alleviate congestion (avoiding specifics from another context).
   
4. **Constraint on Style** - Ensure the instruction is written in an expository style suitable for a technical audience with comprehensive explanations of how GIS contributes to system performance and efficiency, ensuring clarity without oversimplification. Use formal language appropriate for academic or professional readership within tech communities such as those engaged in software development discussions on platforms like Stack Overflow.
   
5. **Constraint on Structure** - Create the document with clearly defined sections that include an introduction to GIS, subsections detailing their benefits (highlighting performance improvements), challenges faced when implementing these systems, and specific design principles for effectively integrating AI/ML models into cloud-based architectures while considering energy efficiency. Each section should begin on a new page in the document format of your choice if applicable to mark division clearly within an academic or professional environment (e.g., `<|page_142|>` and so forth).
   
6. **Constraint on Specific Phrasing** - Use phrases like ""the implementation of cloud-based solutions can reduce energy consumption significantly compared with traditional methods,"" in the Benefits section, highlighting how GIS contributes to system efficiency by optimizing resource allocation dynamically based on real-time needs and demand patterns rather than fixed infrastructure setups.
   
7. ### Solution: Rewrite Textbook Section as a Longer Academic Manuscript Focusing Exclusively on Green Information Systems (GIS) for Enhancing System Performance through Resource Efficiency 

> Overview of this section - This segment is dedicated to discussing the benefits GIS provides in enhancing system performance by optimizing resource usage. Emphasis will be placed on lower energy consumption and reduced power requirements, particularly when comparing cloud-based solutions with traditional PDCs for AI/ML applications or IoT devices. The Low Power/Area Tradeoff principle underpins the benefits of leveraging GIS to achieve these efficiencies.
> 
> In this context, we delve into how Green Information Systems (GIS) are pivotal in transitioning away from energy-intensive traditional data centers toward more sustainable cloud architectures that can handle peak loads efficiently and reduce power usage for AI/ML models or IoT devices. The core of the discussion revolves around a critical examination of how GIS principles apply to various deployment scenarios, including emergency response systems in smart cities where system reliability under heavy demand is vital.
> 
> ### Benefits and Limitations - In-depth analysis on energy consumption reduction through cloud solutions over PDCs for AI/ML workloads or IoT devices; Exploration of how GIS can facilitate dynamic load balancing to optimize system performance while minimizing power usage, potentially improving user experience during peak demand periods.
> 
> ### Design Principles - Detailed outline on integrating cloud-based infrastructure with AI/ML models for optimal energy efficiency; Explanation of design considerations such as selecting appropriate serverless computing options that allow scaling according to real-time needs without maintaining idle resources, thus enhancing the system's green credentials.

2. Requirements for Instagram System Design
2.1 Functional Requirements for Instagram System Design
In functional Requirements, we will not discuss the login or signup page of Instagram. Login and Signup architecture is the same for everyone. We will look for further like posting photos, etc.

Is there any mention of selecting the right hardware or VM instance types?,"Notification Service:
Informs users about relevant events like likes, comments, mentions, and follows.
Pushes notifications to mobile devices through platforms like Firebase Cloud Messaging or Amazon SNS.
Leverages a queueing system for asynchronous notification delivery.
Analytics Service:
Tracks user engagement, post performance, and overall platform usage.
Gathers data on views, likes, comments, shares, and clicks.
Provides insights to improve user experience, optimize content recommendations, and target advertising.
Why we need caching for storing the data?
Cache the data to handle millions of reads. It improves the user experience by making the fetching process fast. We’ll also opt for lazy loading, which minimizes the client’s waiting time.

API Endpoints:

GET /posts/{post_id}: Retrieves details of a post, including the number of likes/dislikes.
POST /posts/{post_id}/like: Registers a like for the post by the authenticated user.
POST /posts/{post_id}/dislike: Registers a dislike for the post by the authenticated user.
DELETE /posts/{post_id}/like: Removes the like for the post by the authenticated user (if previously done).
DELETE /posts/{post_id}/dislike: Removes the dislike for the post by the authenticated user (if previously done).

Reliability: Our databases handle replication and redundancy, so our system stays reliable and data is not lost. The load balancing layer routes requests around failed servers.
