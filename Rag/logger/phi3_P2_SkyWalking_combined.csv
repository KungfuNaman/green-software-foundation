Profiling. Profiling is a powerful tool to help developers understand the performance of their applications from lines of codes perspective. SkyWalking provides profiling feature bundled in native language agents and independent ebpf agents.
Event. Event is a special kind of data, which is used to record the important moments in the system, such as version upgrade, configuration change, etc. Linking the events with metrics could help on explain the peaks or valleys in the metrics, and linking the events with traces and logs could help on troubleshooting root cause.
Why use SkyWalking?

Zabbix, Zipkin, Prometheus, SkyWalking can integrate with other distributed tracing, metrics and logging systems and build a unified APM system to host all data.

---

Portability. SkyWalking can run in multiple environments, including: (1) Use traditional register center like eureka. (2) Use RPC framework including service discovery, like Spring Cloud, Apache Dubbo. (3) Use Service Mesh in modern infrastructure. (4) Use cloud services. (5) Across cloud deployment. SkyWalking should run well in all of these cases.

Portability. SkyWalking can run in multiple environments, including: (1) Use traditional register center like eureka. (2) Use RPC framework including service discovery, like Spring Cloud, Apache Dubbo. (3) Use Service Mesh in modern infrastructure. (4) Use cloud services. (5) Across cloud deployment. SkyWalking should run well in all of these cases.

Profiling. Profiling is a powerful tool to help developers understand the performance of their applications from lines of codes perspective. SkyWalking provides profiling feature bundled in native language agents and independent ebpf agents.
Event. Event is a special kind of data, which is used to record the important moments in the system, such as version upgrade, configuration change, etc. Linking the events with metrics could help on explain the peaks or valleys in the metrics, and linking the events with traces and logs could help on troubleshooting root cause.

Besides the support of various kinds of telemetry formats, the hierarchy structure of objects in SkyWalking is defined as service(s), service instance(s), endpoint(s), process(s). The terms Service, Instance and Endpoint are used everywhere today, so it is worth defining their specific meanings in the context of SkyWalking:",2.5127511024475098," Judgement: Yes
Explanation: The provided text mentions that SkyWalking supports running on multiple environments and has a hierarchical structure using terms like service, instance, endpoint. This implies support for distributed tracing suitable for applications with potentially many small services (microservices). While the context does not explicitly mention microservices or independent scaling of components as features provided by Zabbix, Prometheus, SkyWalking, etc., they are commonly used in conjunction to enable such architectures. Hence I judged that it uses a form of architecture conducive to this goal (microservices), and while the term 'yes' is given for microservice support directly from context which isn’t explicitly stated but implied by distributed tracing capabilities, we should be cautious in our assumptions without direct text evidence.

--- 

Given that there wasn't a specific paragraph detailing ""microservices"" or their benefits within the provided context, my answer would lean towards an assumption based on typical features of such technologies as mentioned (distributed tracing and service-level hierarchies). Without explicit mention in the design document snippet about using microservices for independent scaling capabilities directly from this text alone. Normally a more affirmative 'Yes' might be given if there were direct statements or sections to substantiate that claim; however, it seems we are dealing with an incomplete context and such assumptions cannot always reliably reflect actual software design practices without further evidence.

If the application specifically states ""microservices architecture"" in their documentation related to scalability features within this given snippet of text then a 'Yes' would be appropriate but based on what is provided, I judged with caution due to lacking explicit information about microservices and independent scaling using only these snippets.",27.798928022384644,0,"[(Document(page_content='Use Language based native agent only to build topology and metrics for your business application.\nUse 3rd-party instrument library only, like the Zipkin instrument ecosystem.\nUse Service Mesh probe if you prefer Service Mesh stack and don’t want to use native agents.\nUse Service Mesh probe with Language based native agent or 3rd-party instrument library in pure tracing status.

Profiling. Profiling is a powerful tool to help developers understand the performance of their applications from lines of codes perspective. SkyWalking provides profiling feature bundled in native language agents and independent ebpf agents.
Event. Event is a special kind of data, which is used to record the important moments in the system, such as version upgrade, configuration change, etc. Linking the events with metrics could help on explain the peaks or valleys in the metrics, and linking the events with traces and logs could help on troubleshooting root cause.

Profiling. Profiling is a powerful tool to help developers understand the performance of their applications from lines of codes perspective. SkyWalking provides profiling feature bundled in native language agents and independent ebpf agents.
Event. Event is a special kind of data, which is used to record the important moments in the system, such as version upgrade, configuration change, etc. Linking the events with metrics could help on explain the peaks or valleys in the metrics, and linking the events with traces and logs could help on troubleshooting root cause.
Why use SkyWalking?

Profiling. Profiling is a powerful tool to help developers understand the performance of their applications from lines of codes perspective. SkyWalking provides profiling feature bundled in native language agents and independent ebpf agents.
Event. Event is a special kind of data, which is used to record the important moments in the system, such as version upgrade, configuration change, etc. Linking the events with metrics could help on explain the peaks or valleys in the metrics, and linking the events with traces and logs could help on troubleshooting root cause.
Why use SkyWalking?

Zabbix, Zipkin, Prometheus, SkyWalking can integrate with other distributed tracing, metrics and logging systems and build a unified APM system to host all data.

---

Portability. SkyWalking can run in multiple environments, including: (1) Use traditional register center like eureka. (2) Use RPC framework including service discovery, like Spring Cloud, Apache Dubbo. (3) Use Service Mesh in modern infrastructure. (4) Use cloud services. (5) Across cloud deployment. SkyWalking should run well in all of these cases.
