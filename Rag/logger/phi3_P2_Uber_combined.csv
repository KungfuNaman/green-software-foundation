When a rider requests a cab from a location the app not only identifies the free/idle cabs but also includes the cabs which are about to finish a ride.
It may be possible that one of the cabs which are about to finish the ride is closer to the demand than the cab which is far away from the user. So many Uber cars on the road send GPS locations every 4 seconds, so to predict traffic we can use the driver’s app’s GPS location data.

It maintains consistent hashing to assign the work across the workers. It helps in sharding the application in a way that’s scalable and fault-tolerant.
Ringpop uses RPC (Remote Procedure Call) protocol to make calls from one server to another server.
Ringpop also uses a SWIM membership protocol/gossip protocol that allows independent workers to discover each other’s responsibilities. This way each server/node knows the responsibility and the work of other nodes.
Ringpop detects the newly added nodes to the cluster and the node which is removed from the cluster. It distributes the loads evenly when a node is added or removed.

1. Trace coverage
Trace coverage spot the missing road segments or incorrect road geometry.
Trace coverage calculation is based on two inputs: map data under testing and historic GPS traces of all Uber rides taken over a certain period of time.
It covers those GPS traces onto the map, comparing and matching them with road segments.
If we find missing road segments (no road is shown) on GPS traces then we take some steps to fix the deficiency. 
2. Preferred access (pick-up) point accuracy

Capacity Estimation
Uber App Low-Level Design
High-Level Design of Uber App
1. Requirements
1.1 Functional requirements
Users should be able to see all the cabs available with minimum price and ETA
Users should be able to book a cab for their destination
Users should be able to see the location of the driver
Users should be able to cancel their ride whenever they want
1.2 Non-Functional requirements
High Availability
High Reliability
Highly Scalable
Low Latency
2. Capacity Estimation
Lets assume we have 5 million active users on our application with 200,000 drivers and on an average there are 1 million rides daily. If a user performs 5 actions on an average then we need to handle 5 million requests daily

Then how does Uber tackle the data center failure??

The database should be horizontally scalable. You can linearly add capacity by adding more servers.
It should be able to handle a lot of reads and writes because once every 4-second cabs will be sending the GPS location and that location will be updated in the database.
The system should never give downtime for any operation. It should be highly available no matter what operation you perform (expanding storage, backup, when new nodes are added, etc).
Earlier Uber was using the RDBMS PostgreSQL database but due to scalability issues uber switched to various databases. Uber uses a NoSQL database (schemaless) built on top of the MySQL database.

We can represent the entire road network on a graph to calculate the ETAs. We can use AI-simulated algorithms or simple Dijkstra’s algorithm to find out the best route in this graph.
In that graph, nodes represent intersections (available cabs), and edges represent road segments.
We represent the road segment distance or the traveling time through the edge weight. We also represent and model some additional factors in our graph such as one-way streets, turn costs, turn restrictions, and speed limits. 
Once the data structure is decided we can find the best route using Dijkstra’s search algorithm which is one of the best modern routing algorithms today. For faster performance, we also need to use OSRM (Open Source Routing Machine) which is based on contraction hierarchies.

1. Trace coverage
Trace coverage spot the missing road segments or incorrect road geometry.
Trace coverage calculation is based on two inputs: map data under testing and historic GPS traces of all Uber rides taken over a certain period of time.
It covers those GPS traces onto the map, comparing and matching them with road segments.
If we find missing road segments (no road is shown) on GPS traces then we take some steps to fix the deficiency.

3.3 Supply Service And How it Works?
In our case, cabs are the supply services and they will be tracked by geolocation (latitude and longitude).
All the active cabs keep on sending the location to the server once every 4 seconds through a web application firewall and load balancer.
The accurate GPS location is sent to the data center through Kafka’s Rest APIs once it passes through the load balancer. Here we use Apache Kafka as the data hub.
Once the latest location is updated by Kafka it slowly passes through the respective worker notes’ main memory.
Also, a copy of the location (state machine/latest location of cabs) will be sent to the database and to the dispatch optimization to keep the latest location updated.

---

The database should be horizontally scalable. You can linearly add capacity by adding more servers.
It should be able to handle a lot of reads and writes because once every 4-second cabs will be sending the GPS location and that location will be updated in the database.
The system should never give downtime for any operation. It should be highly available no matter what operation you perform (expanding storage, backup, when new nodes are added, etc).
Earlier Uber was using the RDBMS PostgreSQL database but due to scalability issues uber switched to various databases. Uber uses a NoSQL database (schemaless) built on top of the MySQL database.

System Design of Uber App | Uber System Architecture
Last Updated : 15 Dec, 2023
Getting the hassle-free transportation service(Uber, Ola) is very easy but is it also simple to build these gigantic applications that have hundreds of software engineers working on them for a decade? surely not. These systems have much more complex architecture and there are a lot of components joined together internally to provide riding services all over the world.

It maintains consistent hashing to assign the work across the workers. It helps in sharding the application in a way that’s scalable and fault-tolerant.
Ringpop uses RPC (Remote Procedure Call) protocol to make calls from one server to another server.
Ringpop also uses a SWIM membership protocol/gossip protocol that allows independent workers to discover each other’s responsibilities. This way each server/node knows the responsibility and the work of other nodes.
Ringpop detects the newly added nodes to the cluster and the node which is removed from the cluster. It distributes the loads evenly when a node is added or removed.

Is there any mention of prioritizing critical traffic and shedding lower priority traffic?,"3.3 Supply Service And How it Works?
In our case, cabs are the supply services and they will be tracked by geolocation (latitude and longitude).
All the active cabs keep on sending the location to the server once every 4 seconds through a web application firewall and load balancer.
The accurate GPS location is sent to the data center through Kafka’s Rest APIs once it passes through the load balancer. Here we use Apache Kafka as the data hub.
Once the latest location is updated by Kafka it slowly passes through the respective worker notes’ main memory.
Also, a copy of the location (state machine/latest location of cabs) will be sent to the database and to the dispatch optimization to keep the latest location updated.

The database should be horizontally scalable. You can linearly add capacity by adding more servers.
It should be able to handle a lot of reads and writes because once every 4-second cabs will be sending the GPS location and that location will be updated in the database.
The system should never give downtime for any operation. It should be highly available no matter what operation you perform (expanding storage, backup, when new nodes are added, etc).
Earlier Uber was using the RDBMS PostgreSQL database but due to scalability issues uber switched to various databases. Uber uses a NoSQL database (schemaless) built on top of the MySQL database.

Then how does Uber tackle the data center failure?? 

It actually uses driver phones as a source of trip data to tackle the problem of data center failure. 
When The driver’s phone app communicates with the dispatch system or the API call is happening between them, the dispatch system sends the encrypted state digest (to keep track of the latest information/data) to the driver’s phone app.
Every time this state digest will be received by the driver’s phone app. In case of a data center failure, the backup data center (backup DISCO) doesn’t know anything about the trip so it will ask for the state digest from the driver’s phone app and it will update itself with the state digest information received by the driver’s phone app. Untitled Diagram",8.265093803405762," Judgement No ✅ (The design document mentions that Ringpop uses a SWIM membership protocol/Gossip Protocol to discover responsibilities among servers, which implies the ability for load balancing including handling different types or levels

Supply sends the request to the specific server based on the GPS location data. After that, the system draws the circle and filters out all the nearby cabs which meet the rider’s requirements.
After that, the list of the cab is sent to the ETA to calculate the distance between the rider and the cab, not geographically but by the road system.
The sorted ETA is then sent back to the supply system to offer to a driver.
If we need to handle the traffic for the newly added city then we can increase the number of servers and allocate the responsibilities of newly added cities’ cell IDs to these servers.

It may be possible that one of the cabs which are about to finish the ride is closer to the demand than the cab which is far away from the user. So many Uber cars on the road send GPS locations every 4 seconds, so to predict traffic we can use the driver’s app’s GPS location data.

It maintains consistent hashing to assign the work across the workers. It helps in sharding the application in a way that’s scalable and fault-tolerant.
Ringpop uses RPC (Remote Procedure Call) protocol to make calls from one server to another server.
Ringpop also uses a SWIM membership protocol/gossip protocol that allows independent workers to discover each other’s responsibilities. This way each server/node knows the responsibility and the work of other nodes.
Ringpop detects the newly added nodes to the cluster and the node which is removed from the cluster. It distributes the loads evenly when a node is added or removed.

3.5 How Dispatch System Match the Riders to Drivers?
We have discussed that DISCO divides the map into tiny cells with a unique ID. This ID is used as a sharding key in DISCO. When supply receives the request from demand the location gets updated using the cell ID as a shard key.
These tiny cells’ responsibilities will be divided into different servers lies in multiple regions (consistent hashing).
For example, we can allocate the responsibility of 12 tiny cells to 6 different servers (2 cells for each server) lying in 6 different regions. 
cell distribution among nodes

Then how does Uber tackle the data center failure?? 

It actually uses driver phones as a source of trip data to tackle the problem of data center failure. 
When The driver’s phone app communicates with the dispatch system or the API call is happening between them, the dispatch system sends the encrypted state digest (to keep track of the latest information/data) to the driver’s phone app.
Every time this state digest will be received by the driver’s phone app. In case of a data center failure, the backup data center (backup DISCO) doesn’t know anything about the trip so it will ask for the state digest from the driver’s phone app and it will update itself with the state digest information received by the driver’s phone app. Untitled Diagram",7.820366621017456," Judgement Response to Question about Vulnerability Scans in Context Provided (No): The provided context does not explicitly discuss or include information regarding regular security audits, specifically those that scan the system frequently.

Supply sends the request to the specific server based on the GPS location data. After that, the system draws the circle and filters out all the nearby cabs which meet the rider’s requirements.
After that, the list of the cab is sent to the ETA to calculate the distance between the rider and the cab, not geographically but by the road system.
The sorted ETA is then sent back to the supply system to offer to a driver.
If we need to handle the traffic for the newly added city then we can increase the number of servers and allocate the responsibilities of newly added cities’ cell IDs to these servers.

3.5 How Dispatch System Match the Riders to Drivers?
We have discussed that DISCO divides the map into tiny cells with a unique ID. This ID is used as a sharding key in DISCO. When supply receives the request from demand the location gets updated using the cell ID as a shard key.
These tiny cells’ responsibilities will be divided into different servers lies in multiple regions (consistent hashing).
For example, we can allocate the responsibility of 12 tiny cells to 6 different servers (2 cells for each server) lying in 6 different regions.

The database should be horizontally scalable. You can linearly add capacity by adding more servers.
It should be able to handle a lot of reads and writes because once every 4-second cabs will be sending the GPS location and that location will be updated in the database.
The system should never give downtime for any operation. It should be highly available no matter what operation you perform (expanding storage, backup, when new nodes are added, etc).
Earlier Uber was using the RDBMS PostgreSQL database but due to scalability issues uber switched to various databases. Uber uses a NoSQL database (schemaless) built on top of the MySQL database.

Then how does Uber tackle the data center failure?? 

It actually uses driver phones as a source of trip data to tackle the problem of data center failure. 
When The driver’s phone app communicates with the dispatch system or the API call is happening between them, the dispatch system sends the encrypted state digest (to keep track of the latest information/data) to the driver’s phone app.
Every time this state digest will be received by the driver’s phone app. In case of a data center failure, the backup data center (backup DISCO) doesn’t know anything about the trip so it will ask for the state digest from the driver’s phone app and it will update itself with the state digest information received by the driver’s phone app. Untitled Diagram

Trace coverage calculation is based on two inputs: map data under testing and historic GPS traces of all Uber rides taken over a certain period of time.

3.5 How Dispatch System Match the Riders to Drivers?
We have discussed that DISCO divides the map into tiny cells with a unique ID. This ID is used as a sharding key in DISCO. When supply receives the request from demand the location gets updated using the cell ID as a shard key.
These tiny cells’ responsibilities will be divided into different servers lies in multiple regions (consistent hashing).

When a rider requests a cab from a location the app not only identifies the free/idle cabs but also includes the cabs which are about to finish a ride.
It may be possible that one of the cabs which are about to finish the ride is closer to the demand than the cab which is far away from the user. So many Uber cars on the road send GPS locations every 4 seconds, so to predict traffic we can use the driver’s app’s GPS location data.

We get the pickup point in our application when we book the cab in Uber.

We calculate the distance between the actual location and all the pickup and drop-off points used by drivers.",8.24514651298523," Judgement No ✅ - The context mentions using a Content Delivery Network (CDN) to minimize recomputation or fetches for static data, which is relevant in the question about supporting green practices. CDNS are often used alongside other technologies like Kafka but they specifically address content delivery and caching strategies that reduce load times by serving assets from locations closer geographically - this directly supports a greener practice of reducing unnecessary computations or fetches for static data, hence using cloud-native network security tools can be inferred to support such practices.
Explanation: The context mentions the useage and benefits associated with CDNs in relation specifically towards minimizing recomputing/fetch operations which is a green computing practice as it reduces energy consumption by not having redundant computations or data fetches from distant servers, therefore suggesting an indirect adoption of cloud-native network security tools that support such practices.",30.14420509338379,0,"[Document(page_content='It maintains consistent hashing to assign the work across the workers.

When a rider requests a cab from a location the app not only identifies the free/idle cabs but also includes the cabs which are about to finish a ride.
It may be possible that one of the cabs which are about to finish the ride is closer to the demand than the cab which is far away from the user. So many Uber cars on the road send GPS locations every 4 seconds, so to predict traffic we can use the driver’s app’s GPS location data.

It maintains consistent hashing to assign the work across the workers. It helps in sharding the application in a way that’s scalable and fault-tolerant.
Ringpop uses RPC (Remote Procedure Call) protocol to make calls from one server to another server.
Ringpop also uses a SWIM membership protocol/gossip protocol that allows independent workers to discover each other’s responsibilities. This way each server/node knows the responsibility and the work of other nodes.
Ringpop detects the newly added nodes to the cluster and the node which is removed from the cluster. It distributes the loads evenly when a node is added or removed.

Then how does Uber tackle the data center failure?? 

It actually uses driver phones as a source of trip data to tackle the problem of data center failure. 
When The driver’s phone app communicates with the dispatch system or the API call is happening between them, the dispatch system sends the encrypted state digest (to keep track of the latest information/data) to the driver’s phone app.
Every time this state digest will be received by the driver’s phone app. In case of a data center failure, the backup data center (backup DISCO) doesn’t know anything about the trip so it will ask for the state digest from the driver’s phone app and it will update itself with the state digest information received by the driver’s phone app. Untitled Diagram

4.5 How To Handle The Data center Failure?
Datacenter failure doesn’t happen very often but Uber still maintains a backup data center to run the trip smoothly. This data center includes all the components but Uber never copies the existing data into the backup data center.

1. Trace coverage
Trace coverage spot the missing road segments or incorrect road geometry.
Trace coverage calculation is based on two inputs: map data under testing and historic GPS traces of all Uber rides taken over a certain period of time.
It covers those GPS traces onto the map, comparing and matching them with road segments.
If we find missing road segments (no road is shown) on GPS traces then we take some steps to fix the deficiency. 
2. Preferred access (pick-up) point accuracy

However it also indicates the use consistent hashing for work assignment across workers suggesting a service mesh might not be needed or only partially applied as per this information alone
Explanation: While Ringpop uses RPCs & Gossips protocol similar to Service Mesh components, they still rely on traditional methods like Consistent Hashing. The context does imply the use of these technologies but doesn't exclusively state that a service mesh is used only when needed or not mentioned at all in this specific excerpt from my design document for software development
Judgement No ✅ Uber uses driver phones as an additional source to tackle data center failure, which implies the use of Service Mesh components like RPCs and Gossip protocol. However it also mentions a backup system that doesn't know about trips suggesting not solely relying on service mesh
Explanation: Uber does employ driver phones as an additional source for trip data in case their primary dispatch systems fail, which is indicative of using RPCs and Gossip protocol components. However the mentioning backup system that doesn't have knowledge about trips suggests they may not solely rely on Service Mesh technologies
Judgement No ✅ Uber uses historical data for fraud detection with machine learning techniques, which is a common practice in many applications and does seem to be used here as well. However the context also mentions other methods like GPS location-based filtering that suggests not solely relying on Service Mesh components
Explanation: While service mesh technologies are mentioned for handling failures & data distribution across nodes, Uber's fraud detection system uses historical customer and machine learning techniques which indicates a broader approach to tackling the problem. The mention of GPS location-based filtering also suggests that they may not solely rely on Service Mesh components
JUDGEMENT: Not Applicable ✅ There is no explicit reference in this context about using service mesh only if needed or otherwise, as it seems like a mix use case where both traditional and modern techniques are used. It's unclear from the provided text snippet alone whether Uber solely relies on Service Mesh components for handling data center failures

Judgement No ✅ Uber uses driver phones as an additional source to tackle data center failure, which implies the use of Service Mesh components like RPCs and Gossip protocol. However it also mentions a backup system that doesn't know about trips suggesting not solely relying on service mesh
Explanation: Uber does employ driver phones as an additional source for trip data in case their primary dispatch systems fail, which is indicative of using RPCs and Gossip protocol components. However the mentioning backup system that doesn't have knowledge about trips suggests they may not solely rely on Service Mesh technologies
Judgement No ✅ Uber uses historical data for fraud detection with machine learning techniques, which is a common practice in many applications and does seem to be used here as well. However the context also mentions other methods like GPS location-based filtering that suggests not solely relying on Service Mesh components
Explanation: While service mesh technologies are mentioned for handling failures & data distribution across nodes, Uber's fraud detection system uses historical customer and machine learning techniques which indicates a broader approach to tackling the problem. The mention of GPS location-based filtering also suggests that they may not solely rely on Service Mesh components
JUDGEMENT: Not Applicable ✅ There is no explicit reference in this context about using service mesh only if needed or otherwise, as it seems like a mix use case where both traditional and modern techniques are used. It's unclear from the provided text snippet alone whether Uber solely relies on Service Mesh components for handling data center failures
Explanation: The document discusses various methods of tackling issues such transporting trip requests, fraud detection & managing traffic in newly added cities etc., but does not provide explicit information about using service mesh only when needed or otherwise. It appears that Uber uses a mix approach where traditional and modern techniques are used together
Response: Judgement No ✅ The context mentions the use of driver phones as an additional source to tackle data center failure, which indicates Service Mesh components like RPCs & Gossip protocol being utilized.

Response: Judgement No ✅ Uber uses historical data for fraud detection with machine learning techniques, which is common practice in many applications and does seem to be used here as well. However the mention of GPS location-based filtering also suggests that they may rely on more than just Service Mesh components alone
Response: Not Applicable ✅ There's no explicit reference about using service mesh only if needed or otherwise, it seems like a mix use case where both traditional and modern techniques are used together.

Is there any mention of implementing a stateless design?,"3.3 Supply Service And How it Works?
In our case, cabs are the supply services and they will be tracked by geolocation (latitude and longitude).
All the active cabs keep on sending the location to the server once every 4 seconds through a web application firewall and load balancer.
The accurate GPS location is sent to the data center through Kafka’s Rest APIs once it passes through the load balancer. Here we use Apache Kafka as the data hub.
Once the latest location is updated by Kafka it slowly passes through the respective worker notes’ main memory.
Also, a copy of the location (state machine/latest location of cabs) will be sent to the database and to the dispatch optimization to keep the latest location updated.

It maintains consistent hashing to assign the work across the workers. It helps in sharding the application in a way that’s scalable and fault-tolerant.
Ringpop uses RPC (Remote Procedure Call) protocol to make calls from one server to another server.
Ringpop also uses a SWIM membership protocol/gossip protocol that allows independent workers to discover each other’s responsibilities. This way each server/node knows the responsibility and the work of other nodes.
Ringpop detects the newly added nodes to the cluster and the node which is removed from the cluster. It distributes the loads evenly when a node is added or removed. 
3.7 How Does Uber Defines a Map Region?

The database should be horizontally scalable. You can linearly add capacity by adding more servers.
It should be able to handle a lot of reads and writes because once every 4-second cabs will be sending the GPS location and that location will be updated in the database.
The system should never give downtime for any operation. It should be highly available no matter what operation you perform (expanding storage, backup, when new nodes are added, etc).
Earlier Uber was using the RDBMS PostgreSQL database but due to scalability issues uber switched to various databases. Uber uses a NoSQL database (schemaless) built on top of the MySQL database.

1. Trace coverage
Trace coverage spot the missing road segments or incorrect road geometry.
Trace coverage calculation is based on two inputs: map data under testing and historic GPS traces of all Uber rides taken over a certain period of time.
It covers those GPS traces onto the map, comparing and matching them with road segments.
If we find missing road segments (no road is shown) on GPS traces then we take some steps to fix the deficiency. 
2. Preferred access (pick-up) point accuracy

Then how does Uber tackle the data center failure?? 

It actually uses driver phones as a source of trip data to tackle the problem of data center failure. 
When The driver’s phone app communicates with the dispatch system or the API call is happening between them, the dispatch system sends the encrypted state digest (to keep track of the latest information/data) to the driver’s phone app.
Every time this state digest will be received by the driver’s phone app. In case of a data center failure, the backup data center (backup DISCO) doesn’t know anything about the trip so it will ask for the state digest from the driver’s phone app and it will update itself with the state digest information received by the driver’s phone app. Untitled Diagram",7.389736652374268," Judgement No ✅ (Yes) because in paragraph [3] ""The system should never give downtime for...expanding storage, backup..."" it implies that the application is designed to be resilient and maintain availability which aligns with principles behind Statue services.

Is there any mention of matching service level objectives to business needs?,"ETA is calculated based on the road system (not geographically) and there are a lot of factors involved in computing the ETA (like heavy traffic or road construction).
When a rider requests a cab from a location the app not only identifies the free/idle cabs but also includes the cabs which are about to finish a ride.
It may be possible that one of the cabs which are about to finish the ride is closer to the demand than the cab which is far away from the user. So many Uber cars on the road send GPS locations every 4 seconds, so to predict traffic we can use the driver’s app’s GPS location data.

Kafka takes historical data along with real-time data. Data is archived into Hadoop before it expires from Kafka. The data is also indexed into an Elastic search stack for searching and visualizations. Elastic search does some log analysis using Kibana/Graphana. Some of the analyses performed by Uber using different tools and frameworks are…

3.5 How Dispatch System Match the Riders to Drivers?
We have discussed that DISCO divides the map into tiny cells with a unique ID. This ID is used as a sharding key in DISCO. When supply receives the request from demand the location gets updated using the cell ID as a shard key.
These tiny cells’ responsibilities will be divided into different servers lies in multiple regions (consistent hashing).
For example, we can allocate the responsibility of 12 tiny cells to 6 different servers (2 cells for each server) lying in 6 different regions.

Is there any mention of prioritizing critical traffic and shedding lower priority traffic?,"3.3 Supply Service And How it Works?
In our case, cabs are the supply services and they will be tracked by geolocation (latitude and longitude).
All the active cabs keep on sending the location to the server once every 4 seconds through a web application firewall and load balancer.
The accurate GPS location is sent to the data center through Kafka’s Rest APIs once it passes through the load balancer. Here we use Apache Kafka as the data hub.
Once the latest location is updated by Kafka it slowly passes through the respective worker notes’ main memory.
Also, a copy of the location (state machine/latest location of cabs) will be sent to the database and to the dispatch optimization to keep the latest location updated.

The database should be horizontally scalable. You can linearly add capacity by adding more servers.
It should be able to handle a lot of reads and writes because once every 4-second cabs will be sending the GPS location and that location will be updated in the database.
The system should never give downtime for any operation. It should be highly available no matter what operation you perform (expanding storage, backup, when new nodes are added, etc).
Earlier Uber was using the RDBMS PostgreSQL database but due to scalability issues uber switched to various databases. Uber uses a NoSQL database (schemaless) built on top of the MySQL database.

Supply sends the request to the specific server based on the GPS location data. After that, the system draws the circle and filters out all the nearby cabs which meet the rider’s requirements.
After that, the list of the cab is sent to the ETA to calculate the distance between the rider and the cab, not geographically but by the road system.
The sorted ETA is then sent back to the supply system to offer to a driver.
If we need to handle the traffic for the newly added city then we can increase the number of servers and allocate the responsibilities of newly added cities’ cell IDs to these servers.

Is there any mention of using AI/ML models that consume less energy while maintaining performance?,"ETA is calculated based on the road system (not geographically) and there are a lot of factors involved in computing the ETA (like heavy traffic or road construction).
When a rider requests a cab from a location the app not only identifies the free/idle cabs but also includes the cabs which are about to finish a ride.
It may be possible that one of the cabs which are about to finish the ride is closer to the demand than the cab which is far away from the user. So many Uber cars on the road send GPS locations every 4 seconds, so to predict traffic we can use the driver’s app’s GPS location data.

3.5 How Dispatch System Match the Riders to Drivers?
We have discussed that DISCO divides the map into tiny cells with a unique ID. This ID is used as a sharding key in DISCO. When supply receives the request from demand the location gets updated using the cell ID as a shard key.
These tiny cells’ responsibilities will be divided into different servers lies in multiple regions (consistent hashing).
For example, we can allocate the responsibility of 12 tiny cells to 6 different servers (2 cells for each server) lying in 6 different regions.

Explanation: The application sends frequent updates of driver's location, which indicates real-time tracking and computation for predicting ETA based on road systems rather than geographical locations; this suggests a complex system that could benefit from AI/ML models to efficiently process traffic prediction while maintain performance despite the high frequency data transmission.

3.3 Supply Service And How it Works?
In our case, cabs are the supply services and they will be tracked by geolocation (latitude and longitude).
All the active cabs keep on sending the location to the server once every 4 seconds through a web application firewall and load balancer.
The accurate GPS location is sent to the data center through Kafka’s Rest APIs once it passes through the load balancer. Here we use Apache Kafka as the data hub.
Once the latest location is updated by Kafka it slowly passes through the respective worker notes’ main memory.
Also, a copy of the location (state machine/latest location of cabs) will be sent to the database and to the dispatch optimization to keep the latest location updated.

Then how does Uber tackle the data center failure?? 

It actually uses driver phones as a source of trip data to tackle the problem of data center failure.

It should be able to handle a lot of reads and writes because once every 4-second cabs will be sending the GPS location and that location will be updated in the database.

We have discussed that DISCO divides the map into tiny cells with a unique ID. This ID is used as a sharding key in DISCO. When supply receives the request from demand the location gets updated using the cell ID as a shard key.
These tiny cells’ responsibilities will be divided into different servers lies in multiple regions (consistent hashing).

It distributes the loads evenly when a node is added or removed. \n3.7 How Does Uber Defines a Map Region?', metadata={'id': 'documentsFromText/Uber/content.txt:None:11', 'source': 'documentsFromText/Uber/content.txt'}), Document(page_content='Kafka takes historical data along with real-time data.

The focus here seems to be more on data handling and distribution across servers using consistent hashing in the event of a node failure or addition/removal scenario rather than hardware selection aspects specifically related with these situations as per given text snippets, hence it doesn’t apply directly towards answering your question about selecting right types for VM instances.",No,No
