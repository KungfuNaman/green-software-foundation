Example Scenario¶
In this guide, we will use the fictional company Acme Widgets as a basis for the configuration examples. Acme Widgets has a product brochure website (assumed to reside at the domain www.acme.com) that performs very poorly. The content management software they chose takes an unbearable amount of time to generate pages on every request and their engineering team has chosen Traffic Server as a caching proxy layer to improve site performance.

Separately, Acme Widgets has decided to use Traffic Server to help improve the performance of their office’s Internet access, which is hobbled by their reliance on an aging leased line and certain employees’ predilection for extracurricular web browsing.

Finally, if Acme Widgets decides to secure their site with https, they will need two additional remap rules to handle the https requests. Traffic Server can translate an inbound https request to an http request to origin. So, they would have additional remap rules like:

map https://www.acme.com/ http://localhost:8080/
map https://static.acme.com/ https://origin-static.acme.com/
This will require installing a certificate, and adding a line to ssl_multicert.config. Assuming the cert has the static.acme.com alternate name, and that cert should be presented by default:

In our Acme Widgets scenario, they ultimately decide to deploy Traffic Server at which point, since they are running both Traffic Server and their origin web server on the same host, they reconfigure their origin service to listen on port 8080 instead of the default, and change Traffic Server to bind to 80 itself. Updating the remap is thus required, and it should now be:

map http://www.acme.com/ http://localhost:8080/
Now all requests made to www.acme.com are received by Traffic Server which knows to proxy those requests to localhost:8080 if it cannot already serve them from its cache. Because we enabled pristine host headers earlier, the origin service will continue to receive Host: www.acme.com in the HTTP request.

Transparent Proxy
A transparent proxy may be either a reverse or forward proxy (though nearly all reverse proxies are deployed transparently), the defining feature being the use of network routing to send requests through the proxy without any need for clients to configure themselves to do so, and often without the ability for those clients to bypass the proxy.

For a more complete list of definitions, please see the Glossary.

In our Acme Widgets scenario, they ultimately decide to deploy Traffic Server at which point, since they are running both Traffic Server and their origin web server on the same host, they reconfigure their origin service to listen on port 8080 instead of the default, and change Traffic Server to bind to 80 itself. Updating the remap is thus required, and it should now be:

map http://www.acme.com/ http://localhost:8080/
Now all requests made to www.acme.com are received by Traffic Server which knows to proxy those requests to localhost:8080 if it cannot already serve them from its cache.

Transparent Proxy
A transparent proxy may be either a reverse or forward proxy (though nearly all reverse proxies are deployed transparently), the defining feature being the use of network routing to send requests through the proxy without any need for clients to configure themselves to do so, and often without the ability for those clients to bypass the proxy.

For a more complete list of definitions, please see the Glossary.

Transparent Proxy
A transparent proxy may be either a reverse or forward proxy (though nearly all reverse proxies are deployed transparently), the defining feature being the use of network routing to send requests through the proxy without any need for clients to configure themselves to do so, and often without the ability for those clients to bypass the proxy.

For a more complete list of definitions, please see the Glossary.

---

With transparent proxying, clients require no configuration and may be given no option to bypass the proxy. This configuration requires your network to route all requests automatically to the proxy. The details of how to accomplish this routing are entirely dependent upon the layout of your network and the routing devices you use.

For a more detailed discussion of the options, and starting points for configuring each in your network environment, please refer to the Forward Proxy section of the Administrator’s Guide.

In our Acme Widgets scenario, they ultimately decide to deploy Traffic Server at which point, since they are running both Traffic Server and their origin web server on the same host, they reconfigure their origin service to listen on port 8080 instead of the default, and change Traffic Server to bind to 80 itself. Updating the remap is thus required, and it should now be:

map http://www.acme.com/ http://localhost:8080/
Now all requests made to www.acme.com are received by Traffic Server which knows to proxy those requests to localhost:8080 if it cannot already serve them from its cache. Because we enabled pristine host headers earlier, the origin service will continue to receive Host: www.acme.com in the HTTP request.",2.4026808738708496," The provided context does not include specific information about an application or framework tailoring its service level objectives (SLOs) to meet the actual needs of a business. It mainly discusses how Traffic Server, as part of Acme Widget's network infrastructure, is being used and configured in two scenarios: one for improving their public product brochure website performance by caching content on localhost port 8080 after reconfiguring it to listen on this non-default port; the second scenario focuses on enhancing office Internet access using Traffic Server.

Although these configurations aim to address specific needs, such as improving web page generation speed and optimizing network performance for certain employees' usage patterns within an organization (Acme Widgets), there is no explicit mention of service level objectives being tailored based on the actual business requirements beyond their immediate goals stated in this context.

Therefore:
- Answer: Based on the information provided, it cannot be confirmed that Traffic Server or any other application/framework specifically adapt its SLOs to meet Acme Widget's precise needs outside of performance and network optimization concerns.

The text discusses configuring Traffic Server as a caching proxy layer for improved website performance at Acme Widgets and enhancing office internet access by redirecting certain traffic through the server on port 80, which is associated with HTTP protocol operations rather than setting or adjusting service level objectives (SLO).

- Answer: The context does not mention anything about an application/framework regularly reviewing and aligning its Service Level Objectives to remain aligned with changing business goals. It mainly discusses Traffic Server configurations for website performance optimization at Acme Widgets, using port 80 as the default listening port instead of port 8080 in a scenario where both the origin service (web server) and Traffic Server are running on the same host machine. The primary focus is on improving web page generation speed by caching brochure pages that take an unbearable amount of time to generate, as well as enhancing office internet access using pristine Host headers in combination with proper proxy configuration through Traffic Server's remap setting (e.g., 'map http://www.acme.com/ http://localhost:8080/'). There is no information given about how the SLOs of an application are managed or reviewed, and therefore it cannot be inferred from this context whether they regularly adjust their objectives to remain aligned with evolving business goals.

Finally, if Acme Widgets decides to secure their site with https, they will need two additional remap rules to handle the https requests. Traffic Server can translate an inbound https request to an http request to origin. So, they would have additional remap rules like:

map https://www.acme.com/ http://localhost:8080/
map https://static.acme.com/ https://origin-static.acme.com/
This will require installing a certificate, and adding a line to ssl_multicert.config. Assuming the cert has the static.acme.com alternate name, and that cert should be presented by default:

Transparent Proxy
A transparent proxy may be either a reverse or forward proxy (though nearly all reverse proxies are deployed transparently), the defining feature being the use of network routing to send requests through the proxy without any need for clients to configure themselves to do so, and often without the ability for those clients to bypass the proxy.

For a more complete list of definitions, please see the Glossary.

---

With transparent proxying, clients require no configuration and may be given no option to bypass the proxy. This configuration requires your network to route all requests automatically to the proxy. The details of how to accomplish this routing are entirely dependent upon the layout of your network and the routing devices you use.

Configuration¶
We will be tackling two separate configuration scenarios in the following sections. The first is the most common application of a performance-enhancing caching proxy for externally-facing websites, a transparent and caching reverse proxy which forwards all requests presented to it to a single origin address and caches the responses based on their cache control headers (as well as some simple heuristics for specific content types when cache control headers are not present).",2.4166791439056396," Response:

Finally, if Acme Widgets decides to secure their site with https, they will need two additional remap rules to handle the https requests. Traffic Server can translate an inbound https request to an http request to origin. So, they would have additional remap rules like:

map https://www.acme.com/ http://localhost:8080/
map https://static.acme.com/ https://origin-static.acme.com/
This will require installing a certificate, and adding a line to ssl_multicert.config. Assuming the cert has the static.acme.com alternate name, and that cert should be presented by default:

In our Acme Widgets scenario, they ultimately decide to deploy Traffic Server at which point, since they are running both Traffic Server and their origin web server on the same host, they reconfigure their origin service to listen on port 8080 instead of the default, and change Traffic Server to bind to 80 itself. Updating the remap is thus required, and it should now be:

map http://www.acme.com/ http://localhost:8080/
Now all requests made to www.acme.com are received by Traffic Server which knows to proxy those requests to localhost:8080 if it cannot already serve them from its cache. Because we enabled pristine host headers earlier, the origin service will continue to receive Host: www.acme.com in the HTTP request.",2.5032565593719482," Response: Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of rate limiting or traffic filtering techniques being used in the application.

Finally, if Acme Widgets decides to secure their site with https, they will need two additional remap rules to handle the https requests. Traffic Server can translate an inbound https request to an http request to origin. So, they would have additional remap rules like:

map https://www.acme.com/ http://localhost:8080/
map https://static.acme.com/ https://origin-static.acme.com/
This will require installing a certificate, and adding a line to ssl_multicert.config. Assuming the cert has the static.acme.com alternate name, and that cert should be presented by default:

Transparent Proxy
A transparent proxy may be either a reverse or forward proxy (though nearly all reverse proxies are deployed transparently), the defining feature being the use of network routing to send requests through the proxy without any need for clients to configure themselves to do so, and often without the ability for those clients to bypass the proxy.

For a more complete list of definitions, please see the Glossary.

In our Acme Widgets scenario, they ultimately decide to deploy Traffic Server at which point, since they are running both Traffic Server and their origin web server on the same host, they reconfigure their origin service to listen on port 8080 instead of the default, and change Traffic Server to bind to 80 itself. Updating the remap is thus required, and it should now be:

map http://www.acme.com/ http://localhost:8080/
Now all requests made to www.acme.com are received by Traffic Server which knows to proxy those requests to localhost:8080 if it cannot already serve them from its cache. Because we enabled pristine host headers earlier, the origin service will continue to receive Host: www.acme.com in the HTTP request.",2.437960147857666," Response: No, based on the provided context there is no mention of adopting serverless cloud services like AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, or Google Cloud Functions.

Finally, if Acme Widgets decides to secure their site with https, they will need two additional remap rules to handle the https requests. Traffic Server can translate an inbound https request to an http request to origin. So, they would have additional remap rules like:

map https://www.acme.com/ http://localhost:8080/
map https://static.acme.com/ https://origin-static.acme.com/
This will require installing a certificate, and adding a line to ssl_multicert.config. Assuming the cert has the static.acme.com alternate name, and that cert should be presented by default:

Transparent Proxy
A transparent proxy may be either a reverse or forward proxy (though nearly all reverse proxies are deployed transparently), the defining feature being the use of network routing to send requests through the proxy without any need for clients to configure themselves to do so, and often without the ability for those clients to bypass the proxy.

For a more complete list of definitions, please see the Glossary.",2.406127691268921," Based on the provided context, it is not explicitly mentioned that the application or framework uses a single production environment for reducing resource usage. The text discusses how Traffic Server and an origin web server can run on the same host but listen to different ports (8080 vs 80), which suggests they are using separate environments within one physical machine, rather than consolidating into a single shared or dedicated production environment specifically for that purpose.

Response: No direct evidence is provided in the context about utilizing a single production environment solethyly to reduce resource usage across an application/framework. While Traffic Server and its origin web server are configured on one host, they operate independently by using different ports (8080 vs 80). This setup may imply efficient local network routing but doesn't specifically indicate that both services share a single production environment or the purpose of reducing resource usage through this sharing.

Example Scenario¶
In this guide, we will use the fictional company Acme Widgets as a basis for the configuration examples. Acme Widgets has a product brochure website (assumed to reside at the domain www.acme.com) that performs very poorly. The content management software they chose takes an unbearable amount of time to generate pages on every request and their engineering team has chosen Traffic Server as a caching proxy layer to improve site performance.

Separately, Acme Widgets has decided to use Traffic Server to help improve the performance of their office’s Internet access, which is hobbled by their reliance on an aging leased line and certain employees’ predilection for extracurricular web browsing.

Transparent Proxy
A transparent proxy may be either a reverse or forward proxy (though nearly all reverse proxies are deployed transparently), the defining feature being the use of network routing to send requests through the proxy without any need for clients to configure themselves to do so, and often without the ability for those clients to bypass the proxy.

With transparent proxying, clients require no configuration and may be given no option to bypass the proxy. This configuration requires your network to route all requests automatically to the proxy. The details of how to accomplish this routing are entirely dependent upon the layout of your network and the routing devices you use.

For a more detailed discussion of the options, and starting points for configuring each in your network environment, please refer to the Forward Proxy section of the Administrator’s Guide.

Finally, if Acme Widgets decides to secure their site with https, they will need two additional remap rules to handle the https requests. Traffic Server can translate an inbound https request to an http request to origin. So, they would have additional remap rules like:

map https://www.acme.com/ http://localhost:8080/
map https://static.acme.com/ https://origin-static.acme.com/
This will require installing a certificate, and adding a line to ssl_multicert.config. Assuming the cert has the static.acme.com alternate name, and that cert should be presented by default:

Separately, Acme Widgets has decided to use Traffic Server to help improve the performance of their office’s Internet access, which is hobbled by their reliance on an aging leased line and certain employees’ predilection for extracurricular web browsing.

In our Acme Widgets scenario, they ultimately decide to deploy Traffic Server at which point, since they are running both Traffic Server and their origin web server on the same host, they reconfigure their origin service to listen on port 8080 instead of the default, and change Traffic Server to bind to 80 itself. Updating the remap is thus required, and it should now be:

map http://www.acme.com/ http://localhost:8080/
Now all requests made to www.acme.com are received by Traffic Server which knows to proxy those requests to localhost:8080 if it cannot already serve them from its cache. Because we enabled pristine host headers earlier, the origin service will continue to receive Host: www.acme.com in the HTTP request.",2.5515716075897217," Response: Based on the context provided, there is no mention of Traffic Server or any application framework prioritizing critical tasks over non-urgent ones to manage peak loads. The scenario discussed involves using Traffic Server as a caching proxy layer for improving website performance and managing Internet access within an office environment that uses Acme Widgets' product brochure site (www.acme.com). There is no specific information about task prioritization or handling of critical tasks during peak loads in the given context, so we cannot conclude from this scenario whether Traffic Server has such a feature implemented based on it alone.

Finally, if Acme Widgets decides to secure their site with https, they will need two additional remap rules to handle the https requests. Traffic Server can translate an inbound https request to an http request to origin. So, they would have additional remap rules like:

map https://www.acme.com/ http://localhost:8080/
map https://static.acme.com/ https://origin-static.acme.com/

Transparent Proxy
A transparent proxy may be either a reverse or forward proxy (though nearly all reverse proxies are deployed transparently), the defining feature being the use of network routing to send requests through the proxy without any need for clients to configure themselves to do so, and often without the ability for those clients to bypass the proxy.

For a more complete list of definitions, please see the Glossary.

Transparent Proxy
A transparent proxy may be either a reverse or forward proxy (though nearly all reverse proxies are deployed transparently), the defining feature being the use of network routing to send requests through the proxy without any need for clients to configure themselves to do so, and often without the ability for those clients to bypass the proxy.

Finally, if Acme Widgets decides to secure their site with https, they will need two additional remap rules to handle the https requests. Traffic Server can translate an inbound https request to an http request to origin. So, they would have additional remap rules like:

map https://www.acme.com/ http://localhost:8080/
map https://static.acme.com/ https://origin-static.acme.com/
This will require installing a certificate, and adding a line to ssl_multicert.config. Assuming the cert has the static.acme.com alternate name, and that cert should be presented by default:

In our Acme Widgets scenario, they ultimately decide to deploy Traffic Server at which point, since they are running both Traffic Server and their origin web server on the same host, they reconfigure their origin service to listen on port 8080 instead of the default, and change Traffic Server to bind to 80 itself. Updating the remap is thus required, and it should now be:

map http://www.acme.com/ http://localhost:8080/
Now all requests made to www.acme.com are received by Traffic Server which knows to proxy those requests to localhost:8080 if it cannot already serve them from its cache.

In our Acme Widgets scenario, they ultimately decide to deploy Traffic Server at which point, since they are running both Traffic Server and their origin web server on the same host, they reconfigure their origin service to listen on port 8080 instead of the default, and change Traffic Server to bind to 80 itself.

In our Acme Widgets scenario, they ultimately decide to deploy Traffic Server at which point, since they are running both Traffic Server and their origin web server on the same host, they reconfigure their origin service to listen on port 8080 instead of the default, and change Traffic Server to bind to 80 itself. Updating the remap is thus required, and it should now be:

map http://www.acme.com/ http://localhost:8080/
Now all requests made to www.acme.com are received by Traffic Server which knows to proxy those requests to localhost:8080 if it cannot already serve them from its cache. Because we enabled pristine host headers earlier, the origin service will continue to receive Host: www.acme.com in the HTTP request.",2.5612659454345703," Response: Based on the provided context, there is no mention of Kubernetes cron job schedules or optimization of resource usage by running tasks at non-peak times.

With transparent proxying, clients require no configuration and may be given no option to bypass the proxy. This configuration requires your network to route all requests automatically to the proxy. The details of how to accomplish this routing are entirely dependent upon the layout of your network and the routing devices you use.

For a more detailed discussion of the options, and starting points for configuring each in your network environment, please refer to the Forward Proxy section of the Administrator’s Guide.

Transparent Proxy
A transparent proxy may be either a reverse or forward proxy (though nearly all reverse proxies are deployed transparently), the defining feature being the use of network routing to send requests through the proxy without any need for clients to configure themselves to do so, and often without the ability for those clients to bypass the proxy.

Transparent Proxy
A transparent proxy may be either a reverse or forward proxy (though nearly all reverse proxies are deployed transparently), the defining feature being the use of network routing to send requests through the proxy without any need for clients to configure themselves to do so, and often without the ability for those clients to bypass the proxy.

In our Acme Widgets scenario, they ultimately decide to deploy Traffic Server at which point, since they are running both Traffic Server and their origin web server on the same host, they reconfigure their origin service to listen on port 8080 instead of the default, and change Traffic Server to bind to 80 itself. Updating the remap is thus required, and it should now be:

map http://www.acme.com/ http://localhost:8080/
Now all requests made to www.acme.com are received by Traffic Server which knows to proxy those requests to localhost:8080 if it cannot already serve them from its cache. Because we enabled pristine host headers earlier, the origin service will continue to receive Host: www.acme.com in the HTTP request.

Finally, if Acme Widgets decides to secure their site with https, they will need two additional remap rules to handle the https requests. Traffic Server can translate an inbound https request to an http request to origin. So, they would have additional remap rules like:

map https://www.acme.com/ http://localhost:8080/
map https://static.acme.com/ https://origin-static.acme.com/
This will require installing a certificate, and adding a line to ssl_multicert.config. Assuming the cert has the static.acme.com alternate name, and that cert should be presented by default:

With transparent proxying, clients require no configuration and may be given no option to bypass the proxy. This configuration requires your network to route all requests automatically to the proxy. The details of how to accomplish this routing are entirely dependent upon the layout of your network and the routing devices you use.

Example Scenario¶
In this guide, we will use the fictional company Acme Widgets as a basis for the configuration examples. Acme Widgets has a product brochure website (assumed to reside at the domain www.acme.com) that performs very poorly. The content management software they chose takes an unbearable amount of time to generate pages on every request and their engineering team has chosen Traffic Server as a caching proxy layer to improve site performance.

Separately, Acme Widgets has decided to use Traffic Server to help improve the performance of their office’s Internet access, which is hobbled by their reliance on an aging leased line and certain employees’ predilection for extracurricular web browsing.",2.4179089069366455," Response: No, based on the provided context, there is no mention of AI accelerators such as TPUs or NPUs being utilized by Traffic Server for optimizing performance and reducing energy consumption. The focus in this scenario seems to be more on traditional caching proxy layers with transparent proxying capabilities using a network setup that routes all requests automatically towards the proxy without requiring client-side configuration, rather than specifically mentioning AI or specialized hardware acceleration at the edge devices.

Transparent Proxy
A transparent proxy may be either a reverse or forward proxy (though nearly all reverse proxies are deployed transparently), the defining feature being the use of network routing to send requests through the proxy without any need for clients to configure themselves to do so, and often without the ability for those clients to bypass the proxy.

In our Acme Widgets scenario, they ultimately decide to deploy Traffic Server at which point, since they are running both Traffic Server and their origin web server on the same host, they reconfigure their origin service to listen on port 8080 instead of the default, and change Traffic Server to bind to 80 itself. Updating the remap is thus required, and it should now be:

map http://www.acme.com/ http://localhost:8080/
Now all requests made to www.acme.com are received by Traffic Server which knows to proxy those requests to localhost:8080 if it cannot already serve them from its cache. Because we enabled pristine host headers earlier, the origin service will continue to receive Host: www.acme.com in the HTTP request.

As for whether these configurations impact privacy and security, proxy servers inherently act as intermediaries between clients (in the context of a web browser) and the services they request data from on the internet. They can be configured to enhance performance by caching content or managing access with rules that limit traffic based on certain criteria such as user location. However, this does not directly relate to privacy concerns unless sensitive information is being inadvertently exposed through these configurations (e.g., personal browsing data cached). Security risks could arise if the proxy server becomes a target for malicious activity or its configuration lacks proper authentication and encryption standards.

Example Scenario¶
In this guide, we will use the fictional company Acme Widgets as a basis for the configuration examples. Acme Widgets has a product brochure website (assumed to reside at the domain www.acme.com) that performs very poorly. The content management software they chose takes an unbearable amount of time to generate pages on every request and their engineering team has chosen Traffic Server as a caching proxy layer to improve site performance.

Separately, Acme Widgets has decided to use Traffic Server to help improve the performance of their office’s Internet access, which is hobbled by their reliance on an aging leased line and certain employees’ predilection for extracurricular web browsing.

---

In our Acme Widgets scenario, they ultimately decide to deploy Traffic Server at which point, since they are running both Traffic Server and their origin web server on the same host, they reconfigure their origin service to listen on port 8080 instead of the default, and change Traffic Server to bind to 80 itself. Updating the remap is thus required, and it should now be:

map http://www.acme.com/ http://localhost:8080/
Now all requests made to www.acme.com are received by Traffic Server which knows to proxy those requests to localhost:8080 if it cannot already serve them from its cache. Because we enabled pristine host headers earlier, the origin service will continue to receive Host: www.acme.com in the HTTP request.

Transparent Proxy

Finally, if Acme Widgets decides to secure their site with https, they will need two additional remap rules to handle the https requests. Traffic Server can translate an inbound https request to an http request to origin. So, they would have additional remap rules like:

map https://www.acme.com/ http://localhost:8080/
map https://static.acme.com/ https://origin-static.acme.com/
This will require installing a certificate, and adding a line to ssl_multicert.config. Assuming the cert has the static.acme.com alternate name, and that cert should be presented by default:

dest_ip=* ssl_cert_name=/path/to/secret/privatekey/acme.rsa
