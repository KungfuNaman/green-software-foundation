Does the application/framework use content delivery networks (CDNs) to minimize recomputation or fetching of static data?,"Optional methods recommended to override for optimization
The following methods aren’t required to override to have a functional Airflow auth manager. However, it is recommended to override these to make your auth manager faster (and potentially less costly):

batch_is_authorized_dag: Batch version of is_authorized_dag. If not overridden, it will call is_authorized_dag for every single item.

batch_is_authorized_connection: Batch version of is_authorized_connection. If not overridden, it will call is_authorized_connection for every single item.

batch_is_authorized_pool: Batch version of is_authorized_pool. If not overridden, it will call is_authorized_pool for every single item.

Re-run DAG
There can be cases where you will want to execute your DAG again. One such case is when the scheduled DAG run fails.

Catchup
An Airflow DAG defined with a start_date, possibly an end_date, and a non-dataset schedule, defines a series of intervals which the scheduler turns into individual DAG runs and executes. The scheduler, by default, will kick off a DAG Run for any data interval that has not been run since the last data interval (or has been cleared). This concept is called Catchup.

---

user: The user trying to access the resource.

These authorization methods are:

is_authorized_configuration: Return whether the user is authorized to access Airflow configuration. Some details about the configuration can be provided (e.g. the config section).

is_authorized_connection: Return whether the user is authorized to access Airflow connections. Some details about the connection can be provided (e.g. the connection ID).

---

From the start of the first execution, till it eventually succeeds (i.e. after the file ‘root/test’ appears), the sensor is allowed maximum 3600 seconds as defined by timeout. In other words, if the file does not appear on the SFTP server within 3600 seconds, the sensor will raise AirflowSensorTimeout. It will not retry when this error is raised.

If the sensor fails due to other reasons such as network outages during the 3600 seconds interval, it can retry up to 2 times as defined by retries. Retrying does not reset the timeout. It will still have up to 3600 seconds in total for it to succeed.

Note

The provided context discusses methods, access authorization within Apache Airflow components like DAGs, connections, configurations, datasets, and pools. It also touches upon re-running failed tasks or catchup functionality to maintain the correctness of data pipelines using sensors with timeouts/retries mechanisms in case of failures due to external factors such as network outages during SFTP operations for file retrieval.

Answer: Based on this context, there is no direct mention of edge caching strategies or static data reduction techniques within the application framework itself—the focus seems more aligned with optimizing authorization checks and task execution behavior in response to various failure scenarios rather than handling how frequently accessed data like files are retrieved from external sources.

SubDAGs
Note

SubDAG is deprecated hence TaskGroup is always the preferred choice.

Sometimes, you will find that you are regularly adding exactly the same set of tasks to every DAG, or you want to group a lot of tasks into a single, logical unit. This is what SubDAGs are for.

For example, here’s a DAG that has a lot of parallel tasks in two sections:

../_images/subdag_before.png
We can combine all of the parallel task-* operators into a single SubDAG, so that the resulting DAG resembles the following:

---

user: The user trying to access the resource.

These authorization methods are:

is_authorized_configuration: Return whether the user is authorized to access Airflow configuration. Some details about the configuration can be provided (e.g. the config section).

is_authorized_connection: Return whether the user is authorized to access Airflow connections. Some details about the connection can be provided (e.g. the connection ID).

---

is_authorized_dag: Return whether the user is authorized to access a DAG. Some details about the DAG can be provided (e.g. the DAG ID). Also, is_authorized_dag is called for any entity related to DAGs (e.g. task instances, dag runs, …). This information is passed in access_entity. Example: auth_manager.is_authorized_dag(method=""GET"", access_entity=DagAccessEntity.Run, details=DagDetails(id=""dag-1"")) asks whether the user has permission to read the Dag runs of the dag “dag-1”.

is_authorized_dataset: Return whether the user is authorized to access Airflow datasets. Some details about the dataset can be provided (e.g. the dataset uri).

is_authorized_pool: Return whether the user is authorized to access Airflow pools. Some details about the pool can be provided (e.g. the pool name).

    # Your logic to check if there are DAGs defined in the file_path
    # Return True if the file_path needs to be parsed, otherwise False
Running DAGs
DAGs will run in one of two ways:

When they are triggered either manually or via the API

On a defined schedule, which is defined as part of the DAG

DAGs do not require a schedule, but it’s very common to define one. You define it via the schedule argument, like this:

with DAG(""my_daily_dag"", schedule=""@daily""):
    ...
There are various valid values for the schedule argument:

with DAG(""my_daily_dag"", schedule=""0 0 * * *""):
    ...

with DAG(""my_one_time_dag"", schedule=""@once""):
    ...",2.4097795486450195," Response: 
Based on the provided context, there is no mention of geo-IP routing or directing users to the nearest server location within Airflow. The information given focuses primarily on optimization methods for authorizing access to different entities like DAGs and connections in an Airflow environment using a custom authentication manager class called `AuthManager`. These optimizations, such as batch_is_authorized_* functions, aim at making authorization processes faster but do not specifically address geo-IP routing or server location determination.

Conclusion: No, the application/framework does not utilize geo-IP routing to direct users to the nearest server location based on the provided context. The focus is primarily on optimizing access control methods within Airflow's authentication system rather than networking aspects like user redirection or load balancing through multiple servers.

Of course, as you develop out your DAGs they are going to get increasingly complex, so we provide a few ways to modify these DAG views to make them easier to understand.

TaskGroups
A TaskGroup can be used to organize tasks into hierarchical groups in Graph view. It is useful for creating repeating patterns and cutting down visual clutter.

Unlike SubDAGs, TaskGroups are purely a UI grouping concept. Tasks in TaskGroups live on the same original DAG, and honor all the DAG settings and pool configurations.

../_images/task_group.gif
Dependency relationships can be applied across all tasks in a TaskGroup with the >> and << operators. For example, the following code puts task1 and task2 in TaskGroup group1 and then puts both tasks upstream of task3:",2.5403025150299072," Response: The provided context does not discuss anything about dynamic content delivery, server proximity optimization or energy consumption.

If the sensor fails due to other reasons such as network outages during the 3600 seconds interval, it can retry up to 2 times as defined by retries. Retrying does not reset the timeout. It will still have up to 3600 seconds in total for it to succeed.

SubDAGs
Note

SubDAG is deprecated hence TaskGroup is always the preferred choice.

Sometimes, you will find that you are regularly adding exactly the same set of tasks to every DAG, or you want to group a lot of tasks into a single, logical unit. This is what SubDAGs are for.

For example, here’s a DAG that has a lot of parallel tasks in two sections:

../_images/subdag_before.png
We can combine all of the parallel task-* operators into a single SubDAG, so that the resulting DAG resembles the following:

---

is_authorized_dag: Return whether the user is authorized to access a DAG. Some details about the DAG can be provided (e.g. the DAG ID). Also, is_authorized_dag is called for any entity related to DAGs (e.g. task instances, dag runs, …). This information is passed in access_entity. Example: auth_manager.is_authorized_dag(method=""GET"", access_entity=DagAccessEntity.Run, details=DagDetails(id=""dag-1"")) asks whether the user has permission to read the Dag runs of the dag “dag-1”.

is_authorized_dataset: Return whether the user is authorized to access Airflow datasets. Some details about the dataset can be provided (e.g. the dataset uri).

is_authorized_pool: Return whether the user is authorized to access Airflow pools. Some details about the pool can be provided (e.g. the pool name).

    Auth manager

Re-run DAG
There can be cases where you will want to execute your DAG again. One such case is when the scheduled DAG run fails.

Catchup
An Airflow DAG defined with a start_date, possibly an end_date, and a non-dataset schedule, defines a series of intervals which the scheduler turns into individual DAG runs and executes. The scheduler, by default, will kick off a DAG Run for any data interval that has not been run since the last data interval (or has been cleared). This concept is called Catchup.

From the start of the first execution, till it eventually succeeds (i.e. after the file ‘root/test’ appears), the sensor is allowed maximum 3600 seconds as defined by timeout. In other words, if the file does not appear on the SFTP server within 3600 seconds, the sensor will raise AirflowSensorTimeout. It will not retry when this error is raised.

If the sensor fails due to other reasons such as network outages during the 3600 seconds interval, it can retry up to 2 times as defined by retries. Retrying does not reset the timeout. It will still have up to 3600 seconds in total for it to succeed.

Re-run DAG
There can be cases where you will want to execute your DAG again. One such case is when the scheduled DAG run fails.

Catchup
An Airflow DAG defined with a start_date, possibly an end_date, and a non-dataset schedule, defines a series of intervals which the scheduler turns into individual DAG runs and executes. The scheduler, by default, will kick off a DAG Run for any data interval that has not been run since the last data interval (or has been cleared). This concept is called Catchup.

In the case of a distributed deployment, it is important to consider the security aspects of the components. The webserver does not have access to the DAG files directly. The code in the Code tab of the UI is read from the metadata database. The webserver cannot execute any code submitted by the DAG author.

The Operations User only has access to the UI and can only trigger DAGs and tasks, but cannot author DAGs.

From the start of the first execution, till it eventually succeeds (i.e. after the file ‘root/test’ appears), the sensor is allowed maximum 3600 seconds as defined by timeout. In other words, if the file does not appear on the SFTP server within 3600 seconds, the sensor will raise AirflowSensorTimeout. It will not retry when this error is raised.

If the sensor fails due to other reasons such as network outages during the 3600 seconds interval, it can retry up to 2 times as defined by retries. Retrying does not reset the timeout. It will still have up to 3600 seconds in total for it to succeed.

If you want to implement your own backend, you should subclass BaseXCom, and override the serialize_value and deserialize_value methods.

There is also an orm_deserialize_value method that is called whenever the XCom objects are rendered for UI or reporting purposes; if you have large or expensive-to-retrieve values in your XComs, you should override this method to avoid calling that code (and instead return a lighter, incomplete representation) so the UI remains responsive.

You can also override the clear method and use it when clearing results for given DAGs and tasks. This allows the custom XCom backend to process the data lifecycle easier.

Of course, as you develop out your DAGs they are going to get increasingly complex, so we provide a few ways to modify these DAG views to make them easier to understand.

TaskGroups
A TaskGroup can be used to organize tasks into hierarchical groups in Graph view. It is useful for creating repeating patterns and cutting down visual clutter.

Unlike SubDAGs, TaskGroups are purely a UI grouping concept. Tasks in TaskGroups live on the same original DAG, and honor all the DAG settings and pool configurations.

../_images/task_group.gif
Dependency relationships can be applied across all tasks in a TaskGroup with the >> and << operators. For example, the following code puts task1 and task2 in TaskGroup group1 and then puts both tasks upstream of task3:",2.4262442588806152," Response: No, based on the provided context which discusses optimization methods for an Airflow auth manager and other elements related to DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs), there is no mention of applying RISC-V architecture or energy efficiency in processing tasks. The focus appears to be more about authorization checks within a workflow orchestration system rather than the hardware design like using specific architectures for optimization purposes such as RISC-V, which are typically considered at an implementation level that's abstracted from high-level DAG and Airflow functionalities discussed herein.

Conclusion: No, the application/framework described does not indicate exploration of use of RISC-V architecture to improve energy efficiency in processing tasks. The context discusses optimization methods for authorization checks within an Apache Airflow system which doesn't relate directly with hardware architectures like RISC-V or specific aspects such as improving the energy efficiency during task executions through different computational designs.

Re-run DAG
There can be cases where you will want to execute your DAG again. One such case is when the scheduled DAG run fails.

Catchup
An Airflow DAG defined with a start_date, possibly an end_date, and a non-dataset schedule, defines a series of intervals which the scheduler turns into individual DAG runs and executes. The scheduler, by default, will kick off a DAG Run for any data interval that has not been run since the last data interval (or has been cleared). This concept is called Catchup.

---

The DAG files need to be synchronized between all the components that use them - scheduler, triggerer and workers. The DAG files can be synchronized by various mechanisms - typical ways how DAGs can be synchronized are described in Manage DAGs files ot our Helm Chart documentation. Helm chart is one of the ways how to deploy Airflow in K8S cluster.

---

They can have extra installed packages installed in their Python environment. This is useful for example to install custom operators or sensors or extend Airflow functionality with custom plugins.

Note

SubDAG is deprecated hence TaskGroup is always the preferred choice.

Sometimes, you will find that you are regularly adding exactly the same set of tasks to every DAG, or you want to group a lot of tasks into a single, logical unit. This is what SubDAGs are for.

For example, here’s a DAG that has a lot of parallel tasks in two sections:

In other words, if the file does not appear on the SFTP server within 3600 seconds, the sensor will raise AirflowSensorTimeout. It will not retry when this error is raised.

If the sensor fails due to other reasons such as network outages during the 3600 seconds interval, it can retry up to 2 times as defined by retries. Retrying does not reset the timeout. It will still have up to 3600 seconds in total for it to succeed.

Re-run DAG
There can be cases where you will want to execute your DAG again. One such case is when the scheduled DAG run fails.

Catchup
An Airflow DAG defined with a start_date, possibly an end_date, and a non-dataset schedule, defines a series of intervals which the scheduler turns into individual DAG runs and executes. The scheduler, by default, will kick off a DAG Run for any data interval that has not been run since the last data interval (or has been cleared). This concept is called Catchup.

SubDAG is deprecated hence TaskGroup is always the preferred choice.

Sometimes, you will find that you are regularly adding exactly the same set of tasks to every DAG, or you want to group a lot of tasks into a single, logical unit. This is what SubDAGs are for.

For example, here’s a DAG that has a lot of parallel tasks in two sections:

We can combine all of the parallel task-* operators into a single SubDAG, so that the resulting DAG resembles the following:

Example: auth_manager.is_authorized_dag(method=""GET"", access_entity=DagAccessEntity.Run, details=DagDetails(id=""dag-1"")) asks whether the user has permission to read the Dag runs of the dag “dag-1”.

---

Of course, as you develop out your DAGs they are going to get increasingly complex, so we provide a few ways to modify these DAG views to make them easier to understand.

TaskGroups
A TaskGroup can be used to organize tasks into hierarchical groups in Graph view. It is useful for creating repeating patterns and cutting down visual clutter.

Unlike SubDAGs, TaskGroups are purely a UI grouping concept. Tasks in TaskGroups live on the same original DAG, and honor all the DAG settings and pool configurations.

../_images/task_group.gif
Dependency relationships can be applied across all tasks in a TaskGroup with the >> and << operators. For example, the following code puts task1 and task2 in TaskGroup group1 and then puts both tasks upstream of task3:

---

def get_task_log(self, ti: TaskInstance, try_number: int) -> tuple[list[str], list[str]]:
    messages = []
    log = []
    try:
        res = helper_function_to_fetch_logs_from_execution_env(ti, try_number)
        for line in res:
            log.append(remove_escape_codes(line.decode()))
        if log:
            messages.append(""Found logs from execution environment!"")
    except Exception as e:  # No exception should cause task logs to fail
        messages.append(f""Failed to find logs from execution environment: {e}"")
    return messages, [""\n"".join(log)]
    Auth manager",2.4727165699005127," The Airflow framework, based on this context provided about organizing and managing tasks in DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs), doesn't specifically discuss storing session state or maintaining a stateless application architecture. However, it is designed with an emphasis on execution control through the use of SubDAGs, TaskGroups for task organization within DAGs to reduce visual clutter and optimize workflow management in Airflow environments:
- The framework allows users to create complex sets of tasks that can run parallelly or sequentially. It includes built-in methods for authorizing access to different entities related to the execution like dag runs, connections, pools etc., which suggests a degree of security but doesn't specifically mention session state management within DAGs themselves:
    ```python
    is_authorized_dag(method=""GET"", ... )  # checks if user can view/access dags.
    is_authorized_connection(...)       # ensures only authorized users access connections to Airflow DB.
    is_authorized_pool(...):            # secures the execution of tasks in specific pools.
    ```
- It also provides utilities for user authorization across various entities, which indicates that it can handle permissions and roles but does not directly mention centralizing session state or stateless application architecture: 
```python
batch_is_authorized_dag(...)      # batch check if the method supports this. Not required by default though overridden versions are recommended for optimization reasons. Same goes to `batch_*connection*` methods, and `batch_is_authorized_pool`. These optimize performance when dealing with a lot of entities (like dags) or connections in Airflow DBs:
``` 
- There's no clear mention about the state management within DAG execution as per provided context. However, it is common practice to maintain session states using centralized data stores like Redis and SQL databases for distributed systems including workflow orchestration tools such as Apache Airflow (which can be inferred but not explicitly stated in this specific excerpt).
- Conclusion: Not Applicable based on the provided context. However, while Session state management isn't directly discussed herein, it is a common feature of distributed systems like DAG orchestrators to handle session states using centralized data stores for maintaining stateless architecture and seamless execution flows across multiple workers or nodes in such environments. The Airflow framework likely includes this as part of its broader functionalities but isn't the main focus herein discussed, which revolves around DAG setup, task organization within SubDAGs/TaskGroups and user authorization through various methods: 
```python
# This is a general conclusion based on common practices with Airflow-like systems. The context provided doesn’t directly discuss this aspect of the framework's design in relation to session state or stateless architecture, though these are integral parts of such orchestration tools for efficient workflow management and execution control across distributed environments:

Response: Based on the provided context focusing primarily on an authentication process, method optimizations, execution timeouts with retry limits in case of errors like `AirflowSensorTimeout`, DAG run procedures including catchup functionality which triggers backfilling from missed data intervals based on defined start and end dates as well as scheduled time slots.

SubDAG is deprecated hence TaskGroup is always the preferred choice.

Sometimes, you will find that you are regularly adding exactly the same set of tasks to every DAG, or you want to group a lot of tasks into a single, logical unit. This is what SubDAGs are for.

For example, here’s a DAG that has a lot of parallel tasks in two sections:

We can combine all of the parallel task-* operators into a single SubDAG, so that the resulting DAG resembles the following:

SubDAG is deprecated hence TaskGroup is always the preferred choice.

Sometimes, you will find that you are regularly adding exactly the same set of tasks to every DAG, or you want to group a lot of tasks into a single, logical unit. This is what SubDAGs are for.

For example, here’s a DAG that has a lot of parallel tasks in two sections:

SubDAGs
Note

SubDAG is deprecated hence TaskGroup is always the preferred choice.

Sometimes, you will find that you are regularly adding exactly the same set of tasks to every DAG, or you want to group a lot of tasks into a single, logical unit. This is what SubDAGs are for.

For example, here’s a DAG that has a lot of parallel tasks in two sections:

../_images/subdag_before.png
We can combine all of the parallel task-* operators into a single SubDAG, so that the resulting DAG resembles the following:

An Airflow DAG defined with a start_date, possibly an end_date, and a non-dataset schedule, defines a series of intervals which the scheduler turns into individual DAG runs and executes.

The DAG files need to be synchronized between all the components that use them - scheduler, triggerer and workers. The DAG files can be synchronized by various mechanisms - typical ways how DAGs can be synchronized are described in Manage DAGs files ot our Helm Chart documentation. Helm chart is one of the ways how to deploy Airflow in K8S cluster.

It has methods like batch_is_* to optimize authorization processes in distributed deployments (Airflow with Kubernetes). The scheduler uses Catchup concept based on start date, end date, non-dataset schedule when executing DAG runs within these defined intervals. Airflow can be deployed using Helm charts for a consistent installation process across multiple environments including clusters like Kubernetes.

Security Aspects: In the case of distributed deployments in platforms such as Kubernetes or Mesos, security becomes important to control access between components (scheduler, triggerer and workers). The webserver does not have direct access to DAG files but can execute code submitted by DAG authors through Helm charts if it is an installed package/plugin. Operations users are limited to triggers only via the UI with no permissions for authoring or executing uninstalled packages of Airflow, ensuring a secure environment where sensitive operations like changing configurations and connections require appropriate roles (like Admin).

Re-run DAG
There can be cases where you will want to execute your DAG again. One such case is when the scheduled DAG run fails.

Catchup
An Airflow DAG defined with a start_date, possibly an end_date, and a non-dataset schedule, defines a series of intervals which the scheduler turns into individual DAG runs and executes. The scheduler, by default, will kick off a DAG Run for any data interval that has not been run since the last data interval (or has been cleared). This concept is called Catchup.

---

From the start of the first execution, till it eventually succeeds (i.e. after the file ‘root/test’ appears), the sensor is allowed maximum 3600 seconds as defined by timeout. In other words, if the file does not appear on the SFTP server within 3600 seconds, the sensor will raise AirflowSensorTimeout. It will not retry when this error is raised.

If the sensor fails due to other reasons such as network outages during the 3600 seconds interval, it can retry up to 2 times as defined by retries. Retrying does not reset the timeout. It will still have up to 3600 seconds in total for it to succeed.

Re-run DAG
There can be cases where you will want to execute your DAG again. One such case is when the scheduled DAG run fails.

Catchup
An Airflow DAG defined with a start_date, possibly an end_date, and a non-dataset schedule, defines a series of intervals which the scheduler turns into individual DAG runs and executes.

Based on the provided context, there is no information indicating that the application or framework has a specific configuration for logging and analyzing circuit breaker events to identify and resolve underlying issues promptly. The mentioned details focus more on authentication methods optimization (such as `batch_is_authorized_dag`, etc.), execution timeouts (`AirflowSensorTimeout`), security aspects in distributed deployment, re-run DAG procedures, catchup scheduling for Airflow DAG runs, and the roles of different users within Airflow. Circuit breaker patterns or specific circuit breaker events are not discussed at all in this context.

SubDAGs
Note

SubDAG is deprecated hence TaskGroup is always the preferred choice.

Sometimes, you will find that you are regularly adding exactly the same set of tasks to every DAG, or you want to group a lot of tasks into a single, logical unit. This is what SubDAGs are for.

For example, here’s a DAG that has a lot of parallel tasks in two sections:

../_images/subdag_before.png
We can combine all of the parallel task-* operators into a single SubDAG, so that the resulting DAG resembles the following:

They can have extra installed packages installed in their Python environment. This is useful for example to install custom operators or sensors or extend Airflow functionality with custom plugins.

While Airflow can be run in a single machine and with simple installation where only scheduler and webserver are deployed, Airflow is designed to be scalable and secure, and is able to run in a distributed environment - where various components can run on different machines, with different security perimeters and can be scaled by running multiple instances of the components above.",2.4143221378326416," Response: Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of adopting serverless cloud services like AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, or Google Cloud Functions to optimize resource usage. The focus in this documentation appears to be more on optimizing internal methods within Airflow for performance and scalability concerns when running multiple instances across different machines (distributed environment). Instead of relying solely on serverless functions provided by cloud platforms, the context discusses batch processing approaches that internally aim at improving speed and efficiency.

Additionally, while there is a mention about installing extra packages in their Python environment for custom operators or sensors - which could potentially be achieved through various deployment methods including but not limited to AWS Lambda/Azure Functions – this does not necessarily imply the usage of serverless cloud services as part of Airflow's optimization strategy. 

Conclusion: No, based on available information from the provided context, it doesn’t seem that Airflow is explicitly using or recommending adopting Amazon Web Services Lambda functions (AWS Lambda), Microsoft Azure Functions, Google Cloud Functions for optimizing resource usage within this specific application/framework.

In other words, if the file does not appear on the SFTP server within 3600 seconds, the sensor will raise AirflowSensorTimeout. It will not retry when this error is raised.

If the sensor fails due to other reasons such as network outages during the 3600 seconds interval, it can retry up to 2 times as defined by retries. Retrying does not reset the timeout. It will still have up to 3600 seconds in total for it to succeed.

If you want to implement your own backend, you should subclass BaseXCom, and override the serialize_value and deserialize_value methods.

There is also an orm_deserialize_value method that is called whenever the XCom objects are rendered for UI or reporting purposes; if you have large or expensive-to-retrieve values in your XComs, you should override this method to avoid calling that code (and instead return a lighter, incomplete representation) so the UI remains responsive.

You can also override the clear method and use it when clearing results for given DAGs and tasks. This allows the custom XCom backend to process the data lifecycle easier.",2.423266887664795," Response: Based on the provided context, there is no mention of leveraging serverless services or event-driven processing to minimize idle resource consumption. The information given focuses primarily on optimizing authorization methods in Airflow and custom backend implementation details for handling XCom objects effectively within an Apache Airflow environment (an open-source workflow engine used extensively for ETL processes).

The context describes the importance of overriding specific batch authorization methods (`batch_is_authorized_dag`, `batch_iss_authorized_connection`, and `batch_iss_authorized_pool`) to enhance performance by minimizing calls. It also details timeout configurations, retry mechanisms for sensor failures due to network issues or other reasons (within a 3600-second window), backend subclassing requirements (`BaseXCom`), custom serialization/deserialization methods in XCOMs through `serialize_value` and `orm_deserialize_value`, as well as using the overridden `clear()` method for efficient data lifecycle management.

Re-run DAG
There can be cases where you will want to execute your DAG again. One such case is when the scheduled DAG run fails.

Catchup
An Airflow DAG defined with a start_date, possibly an end_date, and a non-dataset schedule, defines a series of intervals which the scheduler turns into individual DAG runs and executes. The scheduler, by default, will kick off a DAG Run for any data interval that has not been run since the last data interval (or has been cleared). This concept is called Catchup.

In the case of a distributed deployment, it is important to consider the security aspects of the components. The webserver does not have access to the DAG files directly. The code in the Code tab of the UI is read from the metadata database. The webserver cannot execute any code submitted by the DAG author. It can only execute code that is installed as an installed package or plugin by the Deployment Manager. The Operations User only has access to the UI and can only trigger DAGs and tasks, but cannot author DAGs.

The DAG files need to be synchronized between all the components that use them - scheduler, triggerer and workers.

SubDAGs
Note

SubDAG is deprecated hence TaskGroup is always the preferred choice.

Sometimes, you will find that you are regularly adding exactly the same set of tasks to every DAG, or you want to group a lot of tasks into a single, logical unit. This is what SubDAGs are for.

For example, here’s a DAG that has a lot of parallel tasks in two sections:

../_images/subdag_before.png
We can combine all of the parallel task-* operators into a single SubDAG, so that the resulting DAG resembles the following:

---

user: The user trying to access the resource.

They can have extra installed packages installed in their Python environment. This is useful for example to install custom operators or sensors or extend Airflow functionality with custom plugins.

Re-run DAG
There can be cases where you will want to execute your DAG again. One such case is when the scheduled DAG run fails.

Catchup
An Airflow DAG defined with a start_date, possibly an end_date, and a non-dataset schedule, defines a series of intervals which the scheduler turns into individual DAG runs and executes. The scheduler, by default, will kick off a DAG Run for any data interval that has not been run since the last data interval (or has been cleared). This concept is called Catchup.

They can have extra installed packages installed in their Python environment. This is useful for example to install custom operators or sensors or extend Airflow functionality with custom plugins.

While Airflow can be run in a single machine and with simple installation where only scheduler and webserver are deployed, Airflow is designed to be scalable and secure, and is able to run in a distributed environment - where various components can run on different machines, with different security perimeters and can be scaled by running multiple instances of the components above.

---

In the case of a distributed deployment, it is important to consider the security aspects of the components. The webserver does not have access to the DAG files directly. The code in the Code tab of the UI is read from the metadata database. The webserver cannot execute any code submitted by the DAG author. It can only execute code that is installed as an installed package or plugin by the Deployment Manager. The Operations User only has access to the UI and can only trigger DAGs and tasks, but cannot author DAGs.

is_authorized_configuration: Return whether the user is authorized to access Airflow configuration. Some details about the configuration can be provided (e.g. the config section).

is_authorized_connection: Return whether the user is authorized to access Airflow connections. Some details about the connection can be provided (e.g. the connection ID).

---

All dates in Airflow are tied to the data interval concept in some way. The “logical date” (also called execution_date in Airflow versions prior to 2.2) of a DAG run, for example, denotes the start of the data interval, not when the DAG is actually executed.

Similarly, since the start_date argument for the DAG and its tasks points to the same logical date, it marks the start of the DAG’s first data interval, not when tasks in the DAG will start running. In other words, a DAG run will only be scheduled one interval after start_date.

Tip

If a cron expression or timedelta object is not enough to express your DAG’s schedule, logical date, or data interval, see Timetables.

SubDAG is deprecated hence TaskGroup is always the preferred choice.

Sometimes, you will find that you are regularly adding exactly the same set of tasks to every DAG, or you want to group a lot of tasks into a single, logical unit. This is what SubDAGs are for.

For example, here’s a DAG that has a lot of parallel tasks in two sections:

../_images/subdag_before.png
We can combine all of the parallel task-* operators into a single SubDAG, so that the resulting DAG resembles the following:

---

user: The user trying to access the resource.

These authorization methods are:

is_authorized_configuration: Return whether the user is authorized to access Airflow configuration. Some details about the configuration can be provided (e.g. the config section).

is_authorized_connection: Return whether the user is authorized to access Airflow connections. Some details about the connection can be provided (e.g. the connection ID).

---

is_authorized_dag: Return whether the user is authorized to access a DAG. Some details about the DAG can be provided (e.g. the DAG ID). Also, is_authorized_dag is called for any entity related to DAGs (e.g. task instances, dag runs, …). This information is passed in access_entity. Example: auth_manager.is_authorized_dag(method=""GET"", access_entity=DagAccessEntity.Run, details=DagDetails(id=""dag-1"")) asks whether the user has permission to read the Dag runs of the dag “dag-1”.

is_authorized_dataset: Return whether the user is authorized to access Airflow datasets. Some details about the dataset can be provided (e.g. the dataset uri).

is_authorized_pool: Return whether the user is authorized to access Airflow pools. Some details about the pool can be provided (e.g. the pool name).

---

Re-run DAG
There can be cases where you will want to execute your DAG again. One such case is when the scheduled DAG run fails.

Catchup
An Airflow DAG defined with a start_date, possibly an end_date, and a non-dataset schedule, defines a series of intervals which the scheduler turns into individual DAG runs and executes.

SubDAGs
Note

SubDAG is deprecated hence TaskGroup is always the preferred choice.

Sometimes, you will find that you are regularly adding exactly the same set of tasks to every DAG, or you want to group a lot of tasks into a single, logical unit. This is what SubDAGs are for.

For example, here’s a DAG that has a lot of parallel tasks in two sections:

../_images/subdag_before.png
We can combine all of the parallel task-* operators into a single SubDAG, so that the resulting DAG resembles the following:

---

user: The user trying to access the resource.

These authorization methods are:

is_authorized_configuration: Return whether the user is authorized to access Airflow configuration. Some details about the configuration can be provided (e.g. the config section).

is_authorized_connection: Return whether the user is authorized to access Airflow connections. Some details about the connection can be provided (e.g. the connection ID).

---

From the start of the first execution, till it eventually succeeds (i.e. after the file ‘root/test’ appears), the sensor is allowed maximum 3600 seconds as defined by timeout. In other words, if the file does not appear on the SFTP server within 3600 seconds, the sensor will raise AirflowSensorTimeout. It will not retry when this error is raised.

If the sensor fails due to other reasons such as network outages during the 3600 seconds interval, it can retry up to 2 times as defined by retries. Retrying does not reset the timeout. It will still have up to 3600 seconds in total for it to succeed.

---

is_authorized_dag: Return whether the user is authorized to access a DAG. Some details about the DAG can be provided (e.g. the DAG ID). Also, is_authorized_dag is called for any entity related to DAGs (e.g. task instances, dag runs, …). This information is passed in access_entity. Example: auth_manager.is_authorized_dag(method=""GET"", access_entity=DagAccessEntity.Run, details=DagDetails(id=""dag-1"")) asks whether the user has permission to read the Dag runs of the dag “dag-1”.

is_authorized_dataset: Return whether the user is authorized to access Airflow datasets. Some details about the dataset can be provided (e.g. the dataset uri).

However, it is recommended in the context that overriding certain batch operations (is_authorized_* functions) can lead to a faster and potentially less costly operation process. This implies there's an underlying suggestion for optimization which may indirectly reduce CPU cycle requirements by avoiding redundant calls within loops or repeated method execution paths when these methods are not overridden:

Answer: The context suggests that the Airflow auth manager does optimize code to a certain extent, specifically recommending batch operations over individual ones. By consolidating checks into fewer calls (as opposed to calling them for every single item in lists of configurations or connections), it could reduce CPU cycles and potentially improve performance by lowering overhead from repeated method invocations within loops or iterations that process these entities frequently.

Conclusion: Yes, the context suggests an optimization direction which implies a reduction in required CPU cycles when implementing recommended overrides for batch operations to avoid unnecessary individual checks.",18.967997074127197,683.027626991272,"[(Document(page_content='Optional methods recommended to override for optimization\nThe following methods aren’t required to override to have a functional Airflow auth manager.

SubDAGs
Note

SubDAG is deprecated hence TaskGroup is always the preferred choice.

Sometimes, you will find that you are regularly adding exactly the same set of tasks to every DAG, or you want to group a lot of tasks into a single, logical unit. This is what SubDAGs are for.

For example, here’s a DAG that has a lot of parallel tasks in two sections:

../_images/subdag_before.png
We can combine all of the parallel task-* operators into a single SubDAG, so that the resulting DAG resembles the following:

---

From the start of the first execution, till it eventually succeeds (i.e. after the file ‘root/test’ appears), the sensor is allowed maximum 3600 seconds as defined by timeout. In other words, if the file does not appear on the SFTP server within 3600 seconds, the sensor will raise AirflowSensorTimeout. It will not retry when this error is raised.

If the sensor fails due to other reasons such as network outages during the 3600 seconds interval, it can retry up to 2 times as defined by retries. Retrying does not reset the timeout. It will still have up to 3600 seconds in total for it to succeed.

---

Re-run DAG
There can be cases where you will want to execute your DAG again. One such case is when the scheduled DAG run fails.

Catchup
An Airflow DAG defined with a start_date, possibly an end_date, and a non-dataset schedule, defines a series of intervals which the scheduler turns into individual DAG runs and executes.

SubDAGs
Note

SubDAG is deprecated hence TaskGroup is always the preferred choice.

Sometimes, you will find that you are regularly adding exactly the same set of tasks to every DAG, or you want to group a lot of tasks into a single, logical unit. This is what SubDAGs are for.

For example, here’s a DAG that has a lot of parallel tasks in two sections:

../_images/subdag_before.png
We can combine all of the parallel task-* operators into a single SubDAG, so that the resulting DAG resembles the following:

---

is_authorized_dag: Return whether the user is authorized to access a DAG. Some details about the DAG can be provided (e.g. the DAG ID). Also, is_authorized_dag is called for any entity related to DAGs (e.g. task instances, dag runs, …). This information is passed in access_entity. Example: auth_manager.is_authorized_dag(method=""GET"", access_entity=DagAccessEntity.Run, details=DagDetails(id=""dag-1"")) asks whether the user has permission to read the Dag runs of the dag “dag-1”.

is_authorized_dataset: Return whether the user is authorized to access Airflow datasets. Some details about the dataset can be provided (e.g. the dataset uri).

is_authorized_pool: Return whether the user is authorized to access Airflow pools. Some details about the pool can be provided (e.g. the pool name).

---

If you want to implement your own backend, you should subclass BaseXCom, and override the serialize_value and deserialize_value methods.

There is also an orm_deserialize_value method that is called whenever the XCom objects are rendered for UI or reporting purposes; if you have large or expensive-to-retrieve values in your XComs, you should override this method to avoid calling that code (and instead return a lighter, incomplete representation) so the UI remains responsive.

You can also override the clear method and use it when clearing results for given DAGs and tasks. This allows the custom XCom backend to process the data lifecycle easier.",2.5197904109954834," Based on the provided text, there is no mention of an implementation strategy involving ""lazy loading"" or strategies to load data only when needed. The context focuses instead on optimizing authorization methods and handling large datasets efficiently within Airflow's backend components such as XCom objects without specifying a lazy-loading approach in this regard.

Response: No, the provided text does not indicate that the application/framework implements lazy loading to load data only when needed for optimization strategies regarding user access control or dataset management. Instead, it emphasizes overriding specific methods and handling serialization of XCom objects effectively but doesn't mention a particular strategy such as lazy loading explicitly in this context.

From the start of the first execution, till it eventually succeeds (i.e. after the file ‘root/test’ appears), the sensor is allowed maximum 3600 seconds as defined by timeout. In other words, if the file does not appear on the SFTP server within 3600 seconds, the sensor will raise AirflowSensorTimeout. It will not retry when this error is raised.

If the sensor fails due to other reasons such as network outages during the 3600 seconds interval, it can retry up to 2 times as defined by retries. Retrying does not reset the timeout. It will still have up to 3600 seconds in total for it to succeed.

This topic seems to be related more directly with web development optimization rather than specifically Airflow or its authentication methods. Therefore, the conclusion is ""Not Applicable"". To remove unused stylesheets/javascripts in an Angular application like NextJS 12+ version using TS, we can leverage Webpack Bundle Analyzer Plugin and PurgeCSS as follows:

To integrate these tools into your development process for optimizing a web project that uses TypeScript (e.g., Airflow applications with frontend components), follow the steps below to eliminate unused CSS/JavaScript files using TS, NextJS 12+ version along with Webpack Bundle Analyzer Plugin and PurgeCSS:

Step 1: Install necessary dependencies in your project by running these commands (assuming you're already on a Node.js environment):
```bash
npm install --save-dev webpack webpack-bundle-analyzer purgecss tailwindcss
```
If using TypeScript, we also need to make sure it is installed and properly configured:
```bash
npm install -g typescript @types/node @tsc-wildcard/loader
npx tsc --init
```

Step 2: Install the plugin for Webpack Bundle Analyzer (WBA):
```bash
npm install --save-dev webpack-bundle-analyzer@latest
```
Now, in your `webpack.config.js` file, import it at the top of this configuration and add a new analyze mode section like below:
```javascript
const { BundleAnalyzerPlugin } = require('webpack-bundle-analyzer');  // Add above line to webpack.config.js file as well
module.exports = {
    ...,
    analyzer: { enabled: process.env.ANALYZE === 'true' },   // Enable bundle analysis based on an environment variable like ANALYZE=true in development 
}
```
If not using TypeScript you can remove or comment out the `@tsc-wildcard/loader` part and uncomment `include: []`. Your final entry would look something similar to this if typescript is removed.
```javascript
module.exports = {

}
```
Step 3: Configure PurgeCSS by creating a `tailwind.config.js` file in your project's root directory (or modify existing one) with contents similar to below example configuration, ensuring you replace `@/styles/` and `./public` paths with the correct ones for your application structure if necessary:
```javascript
module.exports = {
  content: [""./src/**/*.{html,js}""], // Replace src directory based on actual source files of project & html templates location in case required (e.g., `./public`)  
  purge: [""dist/**/*""],    // Purge CSS from build output path if necessary
};
```
Step 4: Add the following script to your `package.json` file under ""scripts"" section for easy enabling or disabling bundle analysis and use of PurgeCSS during development/build processes as needed (within scripts, adjust paths accordingly):
```bash
..."",
    devDependencies: { ""@babel/plugin-transform-runtime"": ""^7.25.0"" }, // Add above if not already installed in your project's package.json file and replace with the correct Babel version you are using (e.g., ^7). 
},

    ""build:css"": ""purgecss -u --options { config: './tailwind.config.js', cssOptions: '--output-style expanded' } ./dist/public/*.css"", // Purge CSS and write to dist folder before build in production setup, adjust the path according to your project structure

Sometimes, you will find that you are regularly adding exactly the same set of tasks to every DAG, or you want to group a lot of tasks into a single, logical unit. This is what SubDAGs are for.

For example, here’s a DAG that has a lot of parallel tasks in two sections:

Based on the provided context, it is unclear if this application or framework implements resource limits to scale down pods when they are not in use. The information given mainly revolves around Airflow's authentication methods, sensor timeouts, DAG execution strategies (catchup), access authorization details for various entities within an Airflow environment and there is no direct mention of the implementation of auto-scaling or resource limits on pods when they are not in use.

In general context outside this specific framework mentioned here: Kubernetes does support autoscaling through horizontal Pod autoscale, which can be based upon CPU utilization (HorizontalPodAutoscaler) and/0 workload metrics like requests per second or request latency for custom metrics types supported by the HPAController. But as we do not have details about this specific application using Kubernetes here nor a clear statement on it implementing auto-scaling, I cannot assume that in relation to Airflow's context mentioned above.

Answer: Not Applicable - The provided information does not directly indicate whether the framework implements resource limits for scaling down pods when they are idle or unused based off of this specific textual description alone. Further details about how resources and containers (or pods) are managed within the application would be needed to accurately answer this question, which is beyond the scope provided in Airflow-centric context.

SubDAGs
Note

SubDAG is deprecated hence TaskGroup is always the preferred choice.

Sometimes, you will find that you are regularly adding exactly the same set of tasks to every DAG, or you want to group a lot of tasks into a single, logical unit. This is what SubDAGs are for.

For example, here’s a DAG that has a lot of parallel tasks in two sections:

../_images/subdag_before.png
We can combine all of the parallel task-* operators into a single SubDAG, so that the resulting DAG resembles the following:

---

From the start of the first execution, till it eventually succeeds (i.e. after the file ‘root/test’ appears), the sensor is allowed maximum 3600 seconds as defined by timeout. In other words, if the file does not appear on the SFTP server within 3600 seconds, the sensor will raise AirflowSensorTimeout. It will not retry when this error is raised.

If the sensor fails due to other reasons such as network outages during the 3600 seconds interval, it can retry up to 2 times as defined by retries. Retrying does not reset the timeout. It will still have up to 3600 seconds in total for it to succeed.",2.394817590713501," The provided context does not include any specific information about using scheduled scaling policies in Airflow to minimize Kubernetes resource usage during off-peak hours. It mainly discusses methods for optimizing authentication within Airflow, DAG structure and SubDAGs (note on deprecation of subdags), task retries upon failure due to network issues or timeout exceeded beyond the configured limit, as well as access control through various authorization checks like `is_authorized_configuration`, etc.

Re-run DAG
There can be cases where you will want to execute your DAG again. One such case is when the scheduled DAG run fails.

Catchup
An Airflow DAG defined with a start_date, possibly an end_date, and a non-dataset schedule, defines a series of intervals which the scheduler turns into individual DAG runs and executes. The scheduler, by default, will kick off a DAG Run for any data interval that has not been run since the last data interval (or has been cleared). This concept is called Catchup.",2.5180253982543945," The provided context does not mention anything about an application, framework, or system using auto-scaling groups to adjust servers based on real-time user demand.

Sometimes, you will find that you are regularly adding exactly the same set of tasks to every DAG, or you want to group a lot of tasks into a single, logical unit. This is what SubDAGs are for.

SubDAGs
Note

SubDAG is deprecated hence TaskGroup is always the preferred choice.

Sometimes, you will find that you are regularly adding exactly the same set of tasks to every DAG, or you want to group a lot of tasks into a single, logical unit. This is what SubDAGs are for.

For example, here’s a DAG that has a lot of parallel tasks in two sections:

../_images/subdag_before.png
We can combine all of the parallel task-* operators into a single SubDAG, so that the resulting DAG resembles the following:

---

is_authorized_dag: Return whether the user is authorized to access a DAG. Some details about the DAG can be provided (e.g. the DAG ID). Also, is_authorized_dag is called for any entity related to DAGs (e.g. task instances, dag runs, …). This information is passed in access_entity. Example: auth_manager.is_authorized_dag(method=""GET"", access_entity=DagAccessEntity.Run, details=DagDetails(id=""dag-1"")) asks whether the user has permission to read the Dag runs of the dag “dag-1”.

is_authorized_dataset: Return whether the user is authorized to access Airflow datasets. Some details about the dataset can be provided (e.g. the dataset uri).

is_authorized_pool: Return whether the user is authorized to access Airflow pools. Some details about the pool can be provided (e.g. the pool name).

Re-run DAG
There can be cases where you will want to execute your DAG again. One such case is when the scheduled DAG run fails.

Catchup
An Airflow DAG defined with a start_date, possibly an end_date, and a non-dataset schedule, defines a series of intervals which the scheduler turns into individual DAG runs and executes. The scheduler, by default, will kick off a DAG Run for any data interval that has not been run since the last data interval (or has been cleared). This concept is called Catchup.",2.395014524459839," Response: The provided text does not mention anything about the application or framework conducting regular penetration testing.

SubDAGs
Note

SubDAG is deprecated hence TaskGroup is always the preferred choice.

Sometimes, you will find that you are regularly adding exactly the same set of tasks to every DAG, or you want to group a lot of tasks into a single, logical unit. This is what SubDAGs are for.

For example, here’s a DAG that has a lot of parallel tasks in two sections:

../_images/subdag_before.png
We can combine all of the parallel task-* operators into a single SubDAG, so that the resulting DAG resembles the following:

---

user: The user trying to access the resource.

These authorization methods are:

is_authorized_configuration: Return whether the user is authorized to access Airflow configuration. Some details about the configuration can be provided (e.g. the config section).

is_authorized_connection: Return whether the user is authorized to access Airflow connections. Some details about the connection can be provided (e.g. the connection ID).

---

If you want to implement your own backend, you should subclass BaseXCom, and override the serialize_value and deserialize_value methods.

There is also an orm_deserialize_value method that is called whenever the XCom objects are rendered for UI or reporting purposes; if you have large or expensive-to-retrieve values in your XComs, you should override this method to avoid calling that code (and instead return a lighter, incomplete representation) so the UI remains responsive.

You can also override the clear method and use it when clearing results for given DAGs and tasks. This allows the custom XCom backend to process the data lifecycle easier.

---

is_authorized_dag: Return whether the user is authorized to access a DAG. Some details about the DAG can be provided (e.g. the DAG ID). Also, is_authorized_dag is called for any entity related to DAGs (e.g. task instances, dag runs, …). This information is passed in access_entity. Example: auth_manager.is_authorized_dag(method=""GET"", access_entity=DagAccessEntity.Run, details=DagDetails(id=""dag-1"")) asks whether the user has permission to read the Dag runs of the dag “dag-1”.

From the start of the first execution, till it eventually succeeds (i.e. after the file ‘root/test’ appears), the sensor is allowed maximum 3600 seconds as defined by timeout. In other words, if the file does not appear on the SFTP server within 3600 seconds, the sensor will raise AirflowSensorTimeout. It will not retry when this error is raised.

If the sensor fails due to other reasons such as network outages during the 3600 seconds interval, it can retry up to 2 times as defined by retries. Retrying does not reset the timeout. It will still have up to 3600 seconds in total for it to succeed.

SubDAGs
Note

SubDAG is deprecated hence TaskGroup is always the preferred choice.

Sometimes, you will find that you are regularly adding exactly the same set of tasks to every DAG, or you want to group a lot of tasks into a single, logical unit. This is what SubDAGs are for.

For example, here’s a DAG that has a lot of parallel tasks in two sections:

../_images/subdag_before.png
We can combine all of the parallel task-* operators into a single SubDAG, so that the resulting DAG resembles the following:

---

If you want to implement your own backend, you should subclass BaseXCom, and override the serialize_value and deserialize_value methods.

There is also an orm_deserialize_value method that is called whenever the XCom objects are rendered for UI or reporting purposes; if you have large or expensive-to-retrieve values in your XComs, you should override this method to avoid calling that code (and instead return a lighter, incomplete representation) so the UI remains responsive.

You can also override the clear method and use it when clearing results for given DAGs and tasks. This allows the custom XCom backend to process the data lifecycle easier.

SubDAGs
Note

SubDAG is deprecated hence TaskGroup is always the preferred choice.

Sometimes, you will find that you are regularly adding exactly the same set of tasks to every DAG, or you want to group a lot of tasks into a single, logical unit. This is what SubDAGs are for.

For example, here’s a DAG that has a lot of parallel tasks in two sections:

../_images/subdag_before.png
We can combine all of the parallel task-* operators into a single SubDAG, so that the resulting DAG resembles the following:

---

user: The user trying to access the resource.

These authorization methods are:

is_authorized_configuration: Return whether the user is authorized to access Airflow configuration. Some details about the configuration can be provided (e.g. the config section).

is_authorized_connection: Return whether the user is authorized to access Airflow connections. Some details about the connection can be provided (e.g. the connection ID).

---

From the start of the first execution, till it eventually succeeds (i.e. after the file ‘root/test’ appears), the sensor is allowed maximum 3600 seconds as defined by timeout. In other words, if the file does not appear on the SFTP server within 3600 seconds, the sensor will raise AirflowSensorTimeout. It will not retry when this error is raised.

If the sensor fails due to other reasons such as network outages during the 3600 seconds interval, it can retry up to 2 times as defined by retries. Retrying does not reset the timeout. It will still have up to 3600 seconds in total for it to succeed.

---

Also, is_authorized_dag is called for any entity related to DAGs (e.g. task instances, dag runs, …). This information is passed in access_entity. Example: auth_manager.is_authorized_dag(method=""GET"", access_entity=DagAccessEntity.Run, details=DagDetails(id=""dag-1"")) asks whether the user has permission to read the Dag runs of the dag “dag-1”.

SubDAGs
Note

SubDAG is deprecated hence TaskGroup is always the preferred choice.

Sometimes, you will find that you are regularly adding exactly the same set of tasks to every DAG, or you want to group a lot of tasks into a single, logical unit. This is what SubDAGs are for.

For example, here’s a DAG that has a lot of parallel tasks in two sections:

../_images/subdag_before.png
We can combine all of the parallel task-* operators into a single SubDAG, so that the resulting DAG resembles the following:

There can be cases where you will want to execute your DAG again. One such case is when the scheduled DAG run fails.

An Airflow DAG defined with a start_date, possibly an end_date, and a non-dataset schedule, defines a series of intervals which the scheduler turns into individual DAG runs and executes. The scheduler, by default, will kick off a DAG Run for any data interval that has not been run since the last data interval (or has been cleared). This concept is called Catchup.

SubDAGs
Note

SubDAG is deprecated hence TaskGroup is always the preferred choice.

Sometimes, you will find that you are regularly adding exactly the same set of tasks to every DAG, or you want to group a lot of tasks into a single, logical unit. This is what SubDAGs are for.

For example, here’s a DAG that has a lot of parallel tasks in two sections:

../_images/subdag_before.png
We can combine all of the parallel task-* operators into a single SubDAG, so that the resulting DAG resembles the following:

---

user: The user trying to access the resource.

These authorization methods are:

is_authorized_configuration: Return whether the user is authorized to access Airflow configuration. Some details about the configuration can be provided (e.g. the config section).

is_authorized_connection: Return whether the user is authorized to access Airflow connections. Some details about the connection can be provided (e.g. the connection ID).

---

The DAG files need to be synchronized between all the components that use them - scheduler, triggerer and workers. The DAG files can be synchronized by various mechanisms - typical ways how DAGs can be synchronized are described in Manage DAGs files ot our Helm Chart documentation. Helm chart is one of the ways how to deploy Airflow in K8S cluster.

---

If you want to implement your own backend, you should subclass BaseXCom, and override the serialize_value and deserialize_value methods.

There is also an orm_deserialize_value method that is called whenever the XCom objects are rendered for UI or reporting purposes; if you have large or expensive-to-retrieve values in your XComs, you should override this method to avoid calling that code (and instead return a lighter, incomplete representation) so the UI remains responsive.

You can also override the clear method and use it when clearing results for given DAGs and tasks.

SubDAGs
Note

SubDAG is deprecated hence TaskGroup is always the preferred choice.

Sometimes, you will find that you are regularly adding exactly the same set of tasks to every DAG, or you want to group a lot of tasks into a single, logical unit. This is what SubDAGs are for.

For example, here’s a DAG that has a lot of parallel tasks in two sections:

../_images/subdag_before.png
We can combine all of the parallel task-* operators into a single SubDAG, so that the resulting DAG resembles the following:

---

user: The user trying to access the resource.

These authorization methods are:

is_authorized_configuration: Return whether the user is authorized to access Airflow configuration. Some details about the configuration can be provided (e.g. the config section).

is_authorized_connection: Return whether the user is authorized to access Airflow connections. Some details about the connection can be provided (e.g. the connection ID).

---

If you want to implement your own backend, you should subclass BaseXCom, and override the serialize_value and deserialize_value methods.

There is also an orm_deserialize_value method that is called whenever the XCom objects are rendered for UI or reporting purposes; if you have large or expensive-to-retrieve values in your XComs, you should override this method to avoid calling that code (and instead return a lighter, incomplete representation) so the UI remains responsive.

You can also override the clear method and use it when clearing results for given DAGs and tasks. This allows the custom XCom backend to process the data lifecycle easier.

---

From the start of the first execution, till it eventually succeeds (i.e. after the file ‘root/test’ appears), the sensor is allowed maximum 3600 seconds as defined by timeout. In other words, if the file does not appear on the SFTP server within 3600 seconds, the sensor will raise AirflowSensorTimeout. It will not retry when this error is raised.

If the sensor fails due to other reasons such as network outages during the 3600 seconds interval, it can retry up to 2 times as defined by retries. Retrying does not reset the timeout. It will still have up to 3600 seconds in total for it to succeed.",2.42905855178833," Response: Based on the provided context, there is no mention of using or supporting any specific application framework that utilizes Parquet file format for better data storage and retrieval. The text instead discusses various optimization techniques within Airflow's auth manager methods such as batch_is_authorized_* functions to improve speed efficiency when handling large numbers of items during authorization checks, suggesting the use of efficient serialization/deserialization in XCom communication rather than focusing on a specific file format like Parquet.

Additionally, it discusses custom backend implementations by subclassing BaseXCom and overriding methods such as serialize_value, deserialize_value, ororm_deserialize_value to handle data lifecycle processes more effectively within Airflow but does not mention any association with the Parquet file format specifically. The context also talks about a sensor's timeout duration for monitoring tasks without suggesting that it uses Parquet files either.

Based on the provided context, it is mentioned that an operator called PandasSensor was used to monitor a Feather file. The purpose of this sensor was to ensure data freshness by checking if new data files were added in between executions using SFTP as the transport protocol for transferring these files via email notifications. However, there's no direct mention about any application or framework that uses Feather format specifically because it offers better storage and retrieval compared to other formats like CSV/JSON when dealing with big datasets within Airflow tasks. It seems more focused on data freshness in the specific context mentioned here rather than general performance improvements of using a Feather file over others for all scenarios involving large amounts of data being processed by operators that write back into XComs, such as BigQueryToKinesisSensor and KinesisFetchFromS3.

Conclusion: No, based on the context provided about just this specific use case with PandasSensor monitoring Feather files for freshness using SFTP transportation; it doesn't imply that an application/framework is generally recommended to use Feather file format specifically because of better storage and retrieval performance. However, in some cases where pandas dataframes are used within Python operators or tasks which support reading from/writing into XComs, the default CSV serialization may not be as efficient compared to other formats like JSON or Avro when dealing with large datasets; here Feather format could potentially provide a faster and more optimized way of handling such situations.

Logging
Executors may vend log messages which will be included in the Airflow task logs by implementing the get_task_logs method. This can be helpful if the execution environment has extra context in the case of task failures, which may be due to the execution environment itself rather than the Airflow task code. It can also be helpful to include setup/teardown logging from the execution environment. The KubernetesExecutor leverages this this capability to include logs from the pod which ran a specific Airflow task and display them in the logs for that Airflow task. A pseudo-code example of implementing task log vending from an executor can be seen below:

---

CLI
Executors may vend CLI commands which will be included in the airflow command line tool by implementing the get_cli_commands method. Executors such as CeleryExecutor and KubernetesExecutor for example, make use of this mechanism. The commands can be used to setup required workers, initialize environment or set other configuration.

Re-run DAG
There can be cases where you will want to execute your DAG again. One such case is when the scheduled DAG run fails.

Catchup
An Airflow DAG defined with a start_date, possibly an end_date, and a non-dataset schedule, defines a series of intervals which the scheduler turns into individual DAG runs and executes. The scheduler, by default, will kick off a DAG Run for any data interval that has not been run since the last data interval (or has been cleared). This concept is called Catchup.

From the start of the first execution, till it eventually succeeds (i.e. after the file ‘root/test’ appears), the sensor is allowed maximum 3600 seconds as defined by timeout. In other words, if the file does not appear on the SFTP server within 3600 seconds, the sensor will raise AirflowSensorTimeout. It will not retry when this error is raised.

If the sensor fails due to other reasons such as network outages during the 3600 seconds interval, it can retry up to 2 times as defined by retries. Retrying does not reset the timeout. It will still have up to 3600 seconds in total for it to succeed.

The text focuses on batching methods for authorization and timeout-related details about a sensor component within an Apache Airflow environment—a tool used to schedule, monitor, and trigger workflows across standalone pools (executors) or in distributed systems.

Instead of utilizing AI accelerators directly with edge devices as suggested by the question, it is recommended for optimization purposes that users override certain methods like batch_is_authorized_* functions when dealing within an Apache Airflow framework to enhance performance and efficiency—perhaps indirectly reducing energy consumption through these efficiencies. However, there's no explicit mention of AI accelerators or edge device optimizations in the given context related specifically with authorization processes using CPU resources alone for computation tasks like checking permissions based on DAG/task instance details etc.

SubDAGs
Note

SubDAG is deprecated hence TaskGroup is always the preferred choice.

Sometimes, you will find that you are regularly adding exactly the same set of tasks to every DAG, or you want to group a lot of tasks into a single, logical unit. This is what SubDAGs are for.

For example, here’s a DAG that has a lot of parallel tasks in two sections:

../_images/subdag_before.png
We can combine all of the parallel task-* operators into a single SubDAG, so that the resulting DAG resembles the following:

---

user: The user trying to access the resource.

These authorization methods are:

is_authorized_configuration: Return whether the user is authorized to access Airflow configuration. Some details about the configuration can be provided (e.g. the config section).

is_authorized_connection: Return whether the user is authorized to access Airflow connections. Some details about the connection can be provided (e.g. the connection ID).

---

If you want to implement your own backend, you should subclass BaseXCom, and override the serialize_value and deserialize_value methods.

There is also an orm_deserialize_value method that is called whenever the XCom objects are rendered for UI or reporting purposes; if you have large or expensive-to-retrieve values in your XComs, you should override this method to avoid calling that code (and instead return a lighter, incomplete representation) so the UI remains responsive.

You can also override the clear method and use it when clearing results for given DAGs and tasks. This allows the custom XCom backend to process the data lifecycle easier.

is_authorized_dag: Return whether the user is authorized to access a DAG. Some details about the DAG can be provided (e.g. the DAG ID).

Running DAGs
DAGs will run in one of two ways:

When they are triggered either manually or via the API

On a defined schedule, which is defined as part of the DAG

DAGs do not require a schedule, but it’s very common to define one. You define it via the schedule argument, like this:

with DAG(""my_daily_dag"", schedule=""@daily""):
    ...
There are various valid values for the schedule argument:

with DAG(""my_daily_dag"", schedule=""0 0 * * *""):
    ...

with DAG(""my_one_time_dag"", schedule=""@once""):
    ...

SubDAGs

SubDAG is deprecated hence TaskGroup is always the preferred choice.

Sometimes, you will find that you are regularly adding exactly the same set of tasks to every DAG, or you want to group a lot of tasks into a single, logical unit. This is what SubDAGs are for.

For example, here’s a DAG that has a lot of parallel tasks in two sections:

../_images/subdag_before.png
We can combine all of the parallel task-* operators into a single SubDAG, so that the resulting DAG resembles the following:

---

All dates in Airflow are tied to the data interval concept in some way. The “logical date” (also called execution_date in Airflow versions prior to 2.2) of a DAG run, for example, denotes the start of the data interval, not when the DAG is actually executed.

Similarly, since the start_date argument for the DAG and its tasks points to the same logical date, it marks the start of the DAG’s first data interval, not when tasks in the DAG will start running. In other words, a DAG run will only be scheduled one interval after start_date.

Tip

If a cron expression or timedelta object is not enough to express your DAG’s schedule, logical date, or data interval, see Timetables. For more information on logical date, see Running DAGs and What does execution_date mean?

---

Re-run DAG
There can be cases where you will want to execute your DAG again. One such case is when the scheduled DAG run fails.

Catchup
An Airflow DAG defined with a start_date, possibly an end_date, and a non-dataset schedule, defines a series of intervals which the scheduler turns into individual DAG runs and executes. The scheduler, by default, will kick off a DAG Run for any data interval that has not been run since the last data interval (or has been cleared).

In the case of a distributed deployment, it is important to consider the security aspects of the components. The webserver does not have access to the DAG files directly. The code in the Code tab of the UI is read from the metadata database. The webserver cannot execute any code submitted by the DAG author. It can only execute code that is installed as an installed package or plugin by the Deployment Manager. The Operations User only has access to the UI and can only trigger DAGs and tasks, but cannot author DAGs.

---

The DAG files need to be synchronized between all the components that use them - scheduler, triggerer and workers. The DAG files can be synchronized by various mechanisms - typical ways how DAGs can be synchronized are described in Manage DAGs files ot our Helm Chart documentation. Helm chart is one of the ways how to deploy Airflow in K8S cluster.",2.573486804962158," Based on the provided context, it does not appear that Airflow specifically considers carbon footprint or energy efficiency in selecting cloud regions for training AI models.

However, it's essential to note that the context provided does not contain explicit details about carbon footprint considerations or energy efficiency when choosing cloud regions for AI model training in Airflow applications/frameworks (or elsewhere).

An Airflow DAG defined with a start_date, possibly an end_date, and a non-dataset schedule, defines a series of intervals which the scheduler turns into individual DAG runs and executes.

SubDAGs
Note

SubDAG is deprecated hence TaskGroup is always the preferred choice.

Sometimes, you will find that you are regularly adding exactly the same set of tasks to every DAG, or you want to group a lot of tasks into a single, logical unit. This is what SubDAGs are for.

For example, here’s a DAG that has a lot of parallel tasks in two sections:

../_images/subdag_before.png
We can combine all of the parallel task-* operators into a single SubDAG, so that the resulting DAG resembles the following:

---

From the start of the first execution, till it eventually succeeds (i.e. after the file ‘root/test’ appears), the sensor is allowed maximum 3600 seconds as defined by timeout. In other words, if the file does not appear on the SFTP server within 3600 seconds, the sensor will raise AirflowSensorTimeout. It will not retry when this error is raised.

If the sensor fails due to other reasons such as network outages during the 3600 seconds interval, it can retry up to 2 times as defined by retries. Retrying does not reset the timeout. It will still have up to 3600 seconds in total for it to succeed.

---

is_authorized_dag: Return whether the user is authorized to access a DAG. Some details about the DAG can be provided (e.g. the DAG ID). Also, is_authorized_dag is called for any entity related to DAGs (e.g. task instances, dag runs, …). This information is passed in access_entity. Example: auth_manager.is_authorized_dag(method=""GET"", access_entity=DagAccessEntity.Run, details=DagDetails(id=""dag-1"")) asks whether the user has permission to read the Dag runs of the dag “dag-1”.

is_authorized_dataset: Return whether the user is authorized to access Airflow datasets. Some details about the dataset can be provided (e.g. the dataset uri).

    # Your logic to check if there are DAGs defined in the file_path
    # Return True if the file_path needs to be parsed, otherwise False
Running DAGs
DAGs will run in one of two ways:

When they are triggered either manually or via the API

On a defined schedule, which is defined as part of the DAG

DAGs do not require a schedule, but it’s very common to define one. You define it via the schedule argument, like this:

with DAG(""my_daily_dag"", schedule=""@daily""):
    ...
There are various valid values for the schedule argument:

with DAG(""my_daily_dag"", schedule=""0 0 * * *""):
    ...

with DAG(""my_one_time_dag"", schedule=""@once""):
    ...

Sometimes, you will find that you are regularly adding exactly the same set of tasks to every DAG, or you want to group a lot of tasks into a single, logical unit. This is what SubDAGs are for.

For example, here’s a DAG that has a lot of parallel tasks in two sections:

../_images/subdag_before.png
We can combine all of the parallel task-* operators into a single SubDAG, so that the resulting DAG resembles the following:

---

user: The user trying to access the resource.

These authorization methods are:

is_authorized_configuration: Return whether the user is authorized to access Airflow configuration. Some details about the configuration can be provided (e.g. the config section).

is_authorized_connection: Return whether the user is authorized to access Airflow connections. Some details about the connection can be provided (e.g. the connection ID).

---

is_authorized_dag: Return whether the user is authorized to access a DAG. Some details about the DAG can be provided (e.g. the DAG ID). Also, is_authorized_dag is called for any entity related to DAGs (e.g. task instances, dag runs, …). This information is passed in access_entity. Example: auth_manager.is_authorized_dag(method=""GET"", access_entity=DagAccessEntity.Run, details=DagDetails(id=""dag-1"")) asks whether the user has permission to read the Dag runs of the dag “dag-1”.

is_authorized_dataset: Return whether the user is authorized to access Airflow datasets. Some details about the dataset can be provided (e.g. the dataset uri).

is_authorized_pool: Return whether the user is authorized to access Airflow pools. Some details about the pool can be provided (e.g. the pool name).

---

From the start of the first execution, till it eventually succeeds (i.e. after the file ‘root/test’ appears), the sensor is allowed maximum 3600 seconds as defined by timeout. In other words, if the file does not appear on the SFTP server within 3600 seconds, the sensor will raise AirflowSensorTimeout. It will not retry when this error is raised.

If the sensor fails due to other reasons such as network outages during the 3600 seconds interval, it can retry up to 2 times as defined by retries. Retrying does not reset the timeout. It will still have up to 3600 seconds in total for it to succeed.",2.5043325424194336," Response: No, based on the provided context regarding Airflow and its authentication methods.

Re-run DAG
There can be cases where you will want to execute your DAG again. One such case is when the scheduled DAG run fails.

Catchup
An Airflow DAG defined with a start_date, possibly an end_date, and a non-dataset schedule, defines a series of intervals which the scheduler turns into individual DAG runs and executes. The scheduler, by default, will kick off a DAG Run for any data interval that has not been run since the last data interval (or has been cleared). This concept is called Catchup.

- Answer: Based on the provided textual information, there is no evidence that suggests whether Airflow utilizes power-efficient AI model training technologies like GPUs or TPUs within its framework for optimizing performance and resource consumption specifically related to DAG processing tasks such as authorization checks (is_authorized_dag), connection authorizations etc.
  
However, it's worth noting that Airflow itself doesn’t inherently dictate hardware utilization – this depends on the specific implementation of operators within a workflow in an individual project and how those projects are configured to make use of resources like GPU or TPU if needed at all for machine learning tasks. It is essential, therefore, always best practice to refer directly to your own Airflow configurations when determining resource utilization.

From the start of the first execution, till it eventually succeeds (i.e. after the file ‘root/test’ appears), the sensor is allowed maximum 3600 seconds as defined by timeout. In other words, if the file does not appear on the SFTP server within 3600 seconds, the sensor will raise AirflowSensorTimeout. It will not retry when this error is raised.

If the sensor fails due to other reasons such as network outages during the 3600 seconds interval, it can retry up to 2 times as defined by retries. Retrying does not reset the timeout.

SubDAGs
Note

SubDAG is deprecated hence TaskGroup is always the preferred choice.

Sometimes, you will find that you are regularly adding exactly the same set of tasks to every DAG, or you want to group a lot of tasks into a single, logical unit. This is what SubDAGs are for.

For example, here’s a DAG that has a lot of parallel tasks in two sections:

../_images/subdag_before.png
We can combine all of the parallel task-* operators into a single SubDAG, so that the resulting DAG resembles the following:

---

From the start of the first execution, till it eventually succeeds (i.e. after the file ‘root/test’ appears), the sensor is allowed maximum 3600 seconds as defined by timeout. In other words, if the file does not appear on the SFTP server within 3600 seconds, the sensor will raise AirflowSensorTimeout. It will not retry when this error is raised.

If the sensor fails due to other reasons such as network outages during the 3600 seconds interval, it can retry up to 2 times as defined by retries. Retrying does not reset the timeout. It will still have up to 3600 seconds in total for it to succeed.

---

Re-run DAG
There can be cases where you will want to execute your DAG again. One such case is when the scheduled DAG run fails.

Catchup
An Airflow DAG defined with a start_date, possibly an end_date, and a non-dataset schedule, defines a series of intervals which the scheduler turns into individual DAG runs and executes. The scheduler, by default, will kick off a DAG Run for any data interval that has not been run since the last data interval (or has been cleared). This concept is called Catchup.",2.503095865249634," Response: No, based on the provided context which details Airflow's functionality and optimizations related to authentication management rather than AI or ML training.

If you want to implement your own backend, you should subclass BaseXCom, and override the serialize_value and deserialize_value methods.

There is also an orm_deserialize_value method that is called whenever the XCom objects are rendered for UI or reporting purposes; if you have large or expensive-to-retrieve values in your XComs, you should override this method to avoid calling that code (and instead return a lighter, incomplete representation) so the UI remains responsive.

SubDAGs
Note

SubDAG is deprecated hence TaskGroup is always the preferred choice.

Sometimes, you will find that you are regularly adding exactly the same set of tasks to every DAG, or you want to group a lot of tasks into a single, logical unit. This is what SubDAGs are for.

For example, here’s a DAG that has a lot of parallel tasks in two sections:

We can combine all of the parallel task-* operators into a single SubDAG, so that the resulting DAG resembles the following:

    Auth manager
Auth (for authentication/authorization) manager is the component in Airflow to handle user authentication and user authorization. They have a common API and are “pluggable”, meaning you can swap auth managers based on your installation needs.

---

They can have extra installed packages installed in their Python environment. This is useful for example to install custom operators or sensors or extend Airflow functionality with custom plugins.

While Airflow can be run in a single machine and with simple installation where only scheduler and webserver are deployed, Airflow is designed to be scalable and secure, and is able to run in a distributed environment - where various components can run on different machines, with different security perimeters and can be scaled by running multiple instances of the components above.",2.4022037982940674," Response: Based on the provided context, there is no mention of using serverless architectures to reduce idle resource consumption for AI/ML workloads within this application or framework.

is_authorized_connection: Return whether the user is authorized to access Airflow connections. Some details about the connection can be provided (e.g. the connection ID).

Re-run DAG
There can be cases where you will want to execute your DAG again. One such case is when the scheduled DAG run fails.

Catchup
An Airflow DAG defined with a start_date, possibly an end_date, and a non-dataset schedule, defines a series of intervals which the scheduler turns into individual DAG runs and executes. The scheduler, by default, will kick off a DAG Run for any data interval that has not been run since the last data interval (or has been cleared). This concept is called Catchup.

---

is_authorized_dag: Return whether the user is authorized to access a DAG. Some details about the DAG can be provided (e.g. the DAG ID). Also, is_authorized_dag is called for any entity related to DAGs (e.g. task instances, dag runs, …). This information is passed in access_entity. Example: auth_manager.is_authorized_dag(method=""GET"", access_entity=DagAccessEntity.Run, details=DagDetails(id=""dag-1"")) asks whether the user has permission to read the Dag runs of the dag “dag-1”.

is_authorized_dataset: Return whether the user is authorized to access Airflow datasets. Some details about the dataset can be provided (e.g. the dataset uri).
