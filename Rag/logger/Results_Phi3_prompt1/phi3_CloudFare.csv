Both user groups will connect to Cloudflare through the closest and fastest access point of Cloudflare’s globally distributed network, resulting in a high quality experience for all users no matter where they are.",2.5769219398498535," Application/Framework Details Based on Context Provided: Cloudflare Load Balancing, Cloudflare Tunnel (cloudflared), and their technical aspects. It also touches upon user experience regarding access points in the global network of over 310 cities across more than 120 countries with interconnection to other networks including core Internet exchanges which suggests a robust content delivery mechanism but does not explicitly mention CDNs or recomputation minimization strategies for static data.

Response: The context provided primarily discusses Cloudflare Load Balancing, its global network infrastructure aimed at delivering low RTT endpoint selection and the use of Tunnel (cloudflared) technology that enables users to access private endpoints through a single outbound connection to Cloudflare with transport methods for public or private visibility. While it implies efficiency in routing traffic due to an extensive, optimized network presence across multiple cities and core Internet exchanges globally - often associated with CDN capabilities like reduced latency – the specific mention of using content delivery networks (CDNs) is not provided nor does it detail strategies for recomputation or fetching static data.

Conclusion: Not Applicable based on the given context, as there's no explicit information about whether this application/framework uses CDNs to minimize recomputation or fetching of static data. However, Cloudflare’inherent characteristics such as a large network presence and low RTT selection could be indicative of efficient content delivery mechanisms that are typically associated with the use of CDNs but is not explicitly confirmed in the provided context.",20.953065156936646,1733.0477077960968,"[(Document(page_content='Cloudflare Load Balancing is built on Cloudflare’s connectivity cloud, \u200b\u200ba unified, intelligent platform of programmable cloud-native services that enable secure any-to-any connectivity between all networks (enterprise and Internet), cloud environments, applications, and users.

The provided context does not mention anything about using Kubernetes, container orchestration tools like Docker Swarm or Mesosphere DC/OS.

Cloudflare Tunnel (cloudflared) can be installed directly on the endpoint or any server with IP connectivity to the endpoint. And because the connection to Cloudflare is initiated from where Cloudflare Tunnel was installed to Cloudflare, the only access needed is outbound access to Cloudflare. A single Cloudflare Tunnel can transport traffic to one or many different endpoints in one of two different ways, one which results in the endpoint being publicly accessible and one which keeps the endpoint completely only accessible privately.

​​Hash steering
Hash steering is an endpoint steering algorithm that uses endpoint weight and the request’s source IP address to select an endpoint. The result is that every request from the same IP address will always steer to the same endpoint. It’s important to note that altering the order of endpoints or adding or removing endpoints from the endpoint pool could result in different outcomes when using the hash algorithm.

It integrates with various identity providers such as Okta using SAML or OIDC protocols in an SSO process facilitated by the platform's connectivity cloud. This integration ensures secure access control, wherein group information can be synchronized via SCIM into Cloudflare to establish specific access controls within applications and services connected through its network infrastructure.

Additionally, it provides advanced security measures like TLS-termination for encrypted traffic (mTLS), JWT token validation as part of the authentication process, schema validation ensuring that only well-formed requests are processed by the backend systems while protecting against malicious payload injection attacks. Rate limiting and volumet0ric abuse protection mechanisms help safeguard resources from overwhelming traffic or DDoS attack patterns commonly aimed at web applications, further reinforced with GraphQL protections where needed to mitigate complex query-based threats that may arise in dynamic data fetches.

Given the context provided: Cloudflare's array of security measures and protocol integrations indicates a reliance on cloud-native tools for network communications protection within its ecosystem, which can be extended by using these services as an extension to any application or framework seeking robustness against potential threats. Thus it is clear that the platform supports leveraging such built-in capabilities provided through Cloudflare's suite of features and integrations aimed at securing network communications effectively within its managed environment, while also offering direct benefits for enterprises managing their own infrastructure independently.

Cloudflare supports integrations with multiple identity providers, including of the same type. So if you manage an Okta instance for your employees, but may have acquired another company with its own Okta instance, both can be integrated with Cloudflare. Cloudflare then acts as a proxy for the SSO process. Applications are configured using SAML and OIDC to use Cloudflare for authentication and then Cloudflare in turn redirects users through the authentication flow of an integrated IdP. Group information can also be synchronized via SCIM into Cloudflare to be used in access control policies.

And because the connection to Cloudflare is initiated from where Cloudflare Tunnel was installed to Cloudflare, the only access needed is outbound access to Cloudflare. A single Cloudflare Tunnel can transport traffic to one or many different endpoints in one of two different ways, one which results in the endpoint being publicly accessible and one which keeps the endpoint completely only accessible privately.

With the Cloudflare CDN, Argo Smart Routing is used when:",2.395470142364502," Based on the provided context, Cloudflare Load Balancing is indeed built as a component of Cloudflare's comprehensive connectivity cloud platform. The system employs intelligent services that enable secure connections between various networks and environments by utilizing programmable capabilities for any-to-any networking requirements in over 310 cities across more than 120 countries, alongside its significant interconnection with around 13,000 other networks.

The Argo Smart Routing is explicitly used when employing the Cloudflare CDN (Content Delivery Network) for load balancing purposes in this scenario: it dynamically distributes user requests across multiple servers based on current conditions such as traffic levels and server health to optimize performance, enhance security through protective measures against various forms of API abuse like rate limiting and sequence mitigation along with GraphQL protections.

Therefore, for applications or frameworks using Cloudflare's CDN service: 

Response: Yes, the application/framework employs load balancers to distribute user load across multiple servers dynamically through Argo Smart Routing when utilizing the Cloudflare CDN. This helps in managing traffic efficiently and securing the APIs against potential abuse. The integration with various identity providers for secure single sign-on processes also suggests that access control policies are likely managed effectively using group information synchronized via SCIM, further contributing to a robust security posture within this distributed system infrastructure.

In response to your request regarding additional information related specifically about Cloudflare Tunnel (cloudflared) and its capabilities, here is more detailed insight: The context states that the installation of CloudFlare's tunneling service can occur directly on an endpoint or any server with IP connectivity. This system utilizes a connection from where it was installed back to the Cloudflare network for all traffic routing. Moreover, within this tunnel setup using cloudflared, there are two ways that allow one-to-one communication between endpoints:
1. The endpoint becomes publicly accessible while still maintaining security policies enforced by CloudFlare Tunnel's infrastructure and features like mTLS (Mutual Transport Layer Security). This means traffic to the endpoint is secured, with identity verification through protocols such as JWT validation or schema validations.
2. The second mode keeps communication between endpoints strictly private while still ensuring secure transportation of data via CloudFlare Tunnel's capabilities. In this case, only outbound access from Cloudflare to the tunnel is needed for accessing other services and vice vers0-versa - inward traffic remains localized within a specific network or geographic area designated by an organization using cloudflared as part of their infrastructure strategy.

Regarding rate limiting, volumetric abuse protection (to prevent denial-of-service attacks), sequence mitigation for safeguarding against various exploits in communication protocols like WebSockets and HTTP/2, along with GraphQL protections to secure the data exchange format - CloudFlare Tunnel incorporates these features. These security measures are aimed at ensuring robust protection across all transport mediums (IPv4 or IPv6), application programming interfaces (APIs) exposed through cloudflared tunnels, and also extending them for internal networks via SCIM technology to enforce access control policies effectively within an organization's ecosystem.

Furthermore, the context hints at Cloudflare’s extensive presence in global data centers (over 310 cities across more than 120 countries) and interconnecting with around 13,000 other networks worldwide through core Internet exchanges, suggesting an underlying capability to distribute resources efficiently for scalable solutions like Cloudflare Tunnels. However, the context does not elaborate on specifics regarding automated storage retention policies or deletion of old data after a certain period within this scope - that would require information beyond what's provided in these excerpts from various documents discussing different aspects and services offered by Cloudflare related to networking security and connectivity solutions. For details about CloudFlare Tunnel’s full capabilities, including any potential automated storage retention policies or mechanisms for data deletion based on age criteria within this service scope, one would need access to specific documentation dedicated solely to the management of such features by cloudflared technology as part of a broader Cloudflare suite.

The context underscores CloudFlare's strategic positioning in offering secure and intelligent networking solutions for organizations seeking robust connectivity, application security measures via authentication protocols like SAML or OIDC integration with single sign-on processes that facilitate centralized identity management across disparate Okta instances. However, this does not specifically address the nuances of automated data retention policies related to storage services managed by Cloudflare as part of its broader suite - which would typically be detailed in dedicated documentation covering CloudFlare's Storage and Object Storage Service capabilities.

In summary, while Cloudflare offers a comprehensive platform with various integrations for connectivity security enhancements across networks through networking protocols like mTLS authentication methods alongside JWT validation as part of application layer security measures (such as schema validations), along with its extensive global network presence and advanced features to combat API abuse, the specific details on automated storage retention policies or data deletion mechanisms based upon age criteria within Cloudflare’s scope remain beyond what is addressed in this provided context.",70.26961946487427,1733.0477077960968,"[(Document(page_content='Customers can enable a positive security model using mTLS, JWT validation, and schema validation and protect against additional API abuse with rate limiting and volumetric abuse protection as well as sequence mitigation and GraphQL protections.', metadata={'id': 'documentsFromText/CloudFare/content.txt:None:551', 'source': 'documentsFromText/CloudFare/content.txt'}), 1471.858154296875), (Document(page_content='Cloudflare Load Balancing is built on Cloudflare’s connectivity cloud, \u200b\u200ba unified, intelligent platform of programmable cloud-native services that enable secure any-to-any connectivity between all networks (enterprise and Internet), cloud environments, applications, and users.

Cloudflare supports integrations with multiple identity providers, including of the same type. So if you manage an Okta instance for your employees, but may have acquired another company with its own Okta instance, both can be integrated with Cloudflare. Cloudflare then acts as a proxy for the SSO process. Applications are configured using SAML and OIDC to use Cloudflare for authentication and then Cloudflare in turn redirects users through the authentication flow of an integrated IdP. Group information can also be synchronized via SCIM into Cloudflare to be used in access control policies.

The main difference between Smart Tiered Cache and Global tiered cache is the number of upper tiers that can talk to the origin servers. With Smart Tiered Cache the closest upper tier to the origin is selected using Argo performance and routing data. This means that all requests that experience a cache MISS at a lower tier will funnel through this single upper tier and have a higher percentage chance of a cache HIT to avoid sending traffic to an origin server. However, the downside to this architecture is that the lower tier could be located across the globe from the upper tier.
