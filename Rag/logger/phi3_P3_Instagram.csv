Is there any mention of minimizing the total number of deployed environments?,"Microservices – also known as the microservice architecture – is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of services that are:

Independently deployable
Loosely coupled
Organized around business capabilities
Owned by a small team
The microservice architecture enables an organization to deliver large, complex applications rapidly, frequently, reliably and sustainably – a necessity for competing and winning in today’s world.

API Endpoints:

GET /posts/{post_id}: Retrieves details of a post, including the number of likes/dislikes.
POST /posts/{post_id}/like: Registers a like for the post by the authenticated user.
POST /posts/{post_id}/dislike: Registers a dislike for the post by the authenticated user.
DELETE /posts/{post_id}/like: Removes the like for the post by the authenticated user (if previously done).
DELETE /posts/{post_id}/dislike: Removes the dislike for the post by the authenticated user (if previously done).

Post photos and videos: The users can post photos and videos on Instagram.
Follow and unfollow users: The users can follow and unfollow other users on Instagram.
Like or dislike posts: The users can like or dislike posts of the accounts they follow.
Search photos and videos: The users can search photos and videos based on captions and location.
Generate news feed: The users can view the news feed consisting of the photos and videos (in chronological order) from all the users they follow.
2.2 Non-Functional requirements for Instagram System Design
Scalability: The system should be scalable to handle millions of users in terms of computational resources and storage.
Latency: The latency to generate a news feed should be low.
Availability: The system should be highly available.

At a high level, Instagram can be viewed as a system with the following key components and interactions:

Reliability: Our databases handle replication and redundancy, so our system stays reliable and data is not lost. The load balancing layer routes requests around failed servers.
11. Conclusion
In this article we have discussed about instagram design in which how discussed about the save post and videos, like and dislike the post, show feeds, posting the post or videos, how we can put the hashtags. nstagram’s system design is a complex and sophisticated architecture that prioritizes scalability, availability, security, and user experience. The platform’s success is not only attributed to its user-friendly interface but also to the robust backend infrastructure that supports its massive user base and dynamic content",8.654298305511475," Response: No
Judgement explanation (less than 3 sentences): The context provided does not discuss or suggest strategies for reducing deployments, such as containerization techniques like Docker. It instead focuses on aspects related to user interaction and system reliability within Instagram's architecture without addressing the minimizing of deployed environments directly in terms mentioned technologies (either explicitly through microservices deployment patterns that aim at minimalism or implicitly by discussions around scaling, availability).",10.229979753494263,0,"[Document(page_content='Microservices – also known as the microservice architecture – is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of services that are:\n\nIndependently deployable\nLoosely coupled\nOrganized around business capabilities\nOwned by a small team\nThe microservice architecture enables an organization to deliver large, complex applications rapidly, frequently, reliably and sustainably – a necessity for competing and winning in today’s world.', metadata={'id': 'documentsFromText/Instagram/content.txt:None:24', 'source': 'documentsFromText/Instagram/content.txt'}), Document(page_content='API Endpoints:\n\nGET /posts/{post_id}: Retrieves details of a post, including the number of likes/dislikes.\nPOST /posts/{post_id}/like: Registers a like for the post by the authenticated user.\nPOST /posts/{post_id}/dislike: Registers a dislike for the post by the authenticated user.\nDELETE /posts/{post_id}/like: Removes the like for the post by the authenticated user (if previously done).\nDELETE /posts/{post_id}/dislike: Removes the dislike for the post by the authenticated user (if previously done).', metadata={'id': 'documentsFromText/Instagram/content.txt:None:19', 'source': 'documentsFromText/Instagram/content.txt'}), Document(page_content='Post photos and videos: The users can post photos and videos on Instagram.\nFollow and unfollow users: The users can follow and unfollow other users on Instagram.\nLike or dislike posts: The users can like or dislike posts of the accounts they follow.\nSearch photos and videos: The users can search photos and videos based on captions and location.\nGenerate news feed: The users can view the news feed consisting of the photos and videos (in chronological order) from all the users they follow.\n2.2 Non-Functional requirements for Instagram System Design\nScalability: The system should be scalable to handle millions of users in terms of computational resources and storage.\nLatency: The latency to generate a news feed should be low.\nAvailability: The system should be highly available.', metadata={'id': 'documentsFromText/Instagram/content.txt:None:3', 'source': 'documentsFromText/Instagram/content.txt'}), Document(page_content='At a high level, Instagram can be viewed as a system with the following key components and interactions:\n\ndesign-instagram-hld', metadata={'id': 'documentsFromText/Instagram/content.txt:None:11', 'source': 'documentsFromText/Instagram/content.txt'}), Document(page_content='Reliability: Our databases handle replication and redundancy, so our system stays reliable and data is not lost.
