8. Database Design for Instagram Database Design
We need the following tables to store our data:

---

Availability: The system should be highly available.
Durability: Any uploaded content (photos and videos) should never get lost.
Consistency: We can compromise a little on consistency. It is acceptable if the content (photos or videos) takes time to show in followers’ feeds located in a distant region.
Reliability: The system must be able to tolerate hardware and software failures.
3. Capacity Estimation for Instagram System Design
We have 1 billion users, with 500 million as daily active users. Assume 60 million photos and 35 million videos are shared on Instagram per day. We can consider 3 MB as the maximum size of each photo and 150 MB as the maximum size of each video uploaded on Instagram.On average, each user sends 20 requests (of any type) per day to our service.

# Like a post
response_like = requests.post(url_like, headers=headers)
 
# Unlike a post
response_unlike = requests.delete(url_unlike, headers=headers)
7.4 Search photos and videos

Availability: The system should be highly available.
Durability: Any uploaded content (photos and videos) should never get lost.
Consistency: We can compromise a little on consistency. It is acceptable if the content (photos or videos) takes time to show in followers’ feeds located in a distant region.
Reliability: The system must be able to tolerate hardware and software failures.
3. Capacity Estimation for Instagram System Design
We have 1 billion users, with 500 million as daily active users. Assume 60 million photos and 35 million videos are shared on Instagram per day. We can consider 3 MB as the maximum size of each photo and 150 MB as the maximum size of each video uploaded on Instagram.On average, each user sends 20 requests (of any type) per day to our service.

Feed Generation adjusts based on changed relationships.
User monitors activity:
Client checks notifications feed.
Notifications provide updates on relevant events.
Key Design Considerations:

---

Post photos and videos: The users can post photos and videos on Instagram.
Follow and unfollow users: The users can follow and unfollow other users on Instagram.
Like or dislike posts: The users can like or dislike posts of the accounts they follow.
Search photos and videos: The users can search photos and videos based on captions and location.
Generate news feed: The users can view the news feed consisting of the photos and videos (in chronological order) from all the users they follow.
2.2 Non-Functional requirements for Instagram System Design
Scalability: The system should be scalable to handle millions of users in terms of computational resources and storage.
Latency: The latency to generate a news feed should be low.
Availability: The system should be highly available.

3.1 Storage Per Day
Photos: 60 million photos/day * 3 MB = 180 TeraBytes / day
Videos: 35 million videos/day * 150 MB = 5250 TB / day
Total content size = 180 + 5250 = 5430 TB
The Total Space required for a Year:
5430 TB/day * 365 (days a year) = 1981950 TB = 1981.95 PetaBytes

3.2 Bandwidth Estimation
5430 TB/(24 * 60* 60) = 5430 TB/86400 sec ~= 62.84 GB/s ~= 502.8 Gbps

At a high level, Instagram can be viewed as a system with the following key components and interactions:

This design approach allows for independent deployment, scalability and fault tolerance within the system components (mircoservices).
The Instagram application architecture consists primarily microservice-based designs with multiple layers including: 1) Frontend Layer - handles user interactions through web or mobile interfaces; this layer communicates directly only to backend services.  2*BackEnd Services *Layer comprises all the business logic and data storage needs of an active social media platform like Instagram (e g likes disliked posts, comments etc). This service is responsible for handling requests from both frontend layers as well those coming through API endpoints; it also includes features such has user authentication validation verification before allowing access to any feature on the site.
The *Microservices* layer houses all of Instagram's core functionality including photo/video uploading sharing likes disliked comments etc., while maintaining a consistent interface between services so they can communicate effectively when needed (e g posting comment). 3) Database Layer - stores and retrieves data from various sources such as user profiles posts photos videos, messages conversations. This layer provides access to all the necessary information required by other layers within Instagram's architecture; it also ensures that this critical component remains highly available even under heavy loads or failover scenarios (e g backup database).
The *API Endpoints* are used for communicating between different services in an application, including those defined above. These end points provide a standardized way of interacting with various microservices within Instagram's architecture; they allow developers to create custom integrations that can be easily integrated into their applications without needing direct access or knowledge about specific implementation details (e g creating posts likes disliked comments).
In summary, the design approach used by insta gram is primarily based on a microservices architectural style with multiple layers working together seamlessly to create an active social media platform that can handle millions of users worldwide while providing high availability scalabilty security throughout its entire lifecycle.",26.345876932144165,0,"[Document(page_content='API Endpoints:\n\nGET /posts/{post_id}: Retrieves details of a post, including the number of likes/dislikes.\nPOST /posts/{post_id}/like: Registers a like for the post by the authenticated user.\nPOST /posts/{post_id}/dislike: Registers a dislike for the post by the authenticated user.\nDELETE /posts/{post_id}/like: Removes the like for the post by the authenticated user (if previously done).\nDELETE /posts/{post_id}/dislike: Removes the dislike for the post by the authenticated user (if previously done).', metadata={'id': 'documentsFromText/Instagram/content.txt:None:19', 'source': 'documentsFromText/Instagram/content.txt'}), Document(page_content='Microservices – also known as the microservice architecture – is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of services that are:\n\nIndependently deployable\nLoosely coupled\nOrganized around business capabilities\nOwned by a small team\nThe microservice architecture enables an organization to deliver large, complex applications rapidly, frequently, reliably and sustainably – a necessity for competing and winning in today’s world.', metadata={'id': 'documentsFromText/Instagram/content.txt:None:24', 'source': 'documentsFromText/Instagram/content.txt'}), Document(page_content='Post photos and videos: The users can post photos and videos on Instagram.\nFollow and unfollow users: The users can follow and unfollow other users on Instagram.\nLike or dislike posts: The users can like or dislike posts of the accounts they follow.\nSearch photos and videos: The users can search photos and videos based on captions and location.\nGenerate news feed: The users can view the news feed consisting of the photos and videos (in chronological order) from all the users they follow.\n2.2 Non-Functional requirements for Instagram System Design\nScalability: The system should be scalable to handle millions of users in terms of computational resources and storage.\nLatency: The latency to generate a news feed should be low.\nAvailability: The system should be highly available.', metadata={'id': 'documentsFromText/Instagram/content.txt:None:3', 'source': 'documentsFromText/Instagram/content.txt'}), Document(page_content='2.

10. Scalability for Instagram System Design
Scalability refers to the ability of an organization (or a system, such as a computer network) to perform well under an increased or expanding workload. A system that scales well will be able to maintain or increase its level of performance even as it is tested by larger and larger operational demands.

We can add more servers to application service layers to make the scalability better and handle numerous requests from the clients. We can also increase the number of databases to store the growing users’ data.

3.1 Storage Per Day
Photos: 60 million photos/day * 3 MB = 180 TeraBytes / day
Videos: 35 million videos/day * 150 MB = 5250 TB / day
Total content size = 180 + 5250 = 5430 TB
The Total Space required for a Year:
5430 TB/day * 365 (days a year) = 1981950 TB = 1981.95 PetaBytes

3.2 Bandwidth Estimation
5430 TB/(24 * 60* 60) = 5430 TB/86400 sec ~= 62.84 GB/s ~= 502.8 Gbps

Durability: Any uploaded content (photos and videos) should never get lost.
Consistency: We can compromise a little on consistency. It is acceptable if the content (photos or videos) takes time to show in followers’ feeds located in a distant region.
Reliability: The system must be able to tolerate hardware and software failures.

3.1 Storage Per Day
Photos: 60 million photos/day * 3 MB = 180 TeraBytes / day
Videos: 35 million videos/day * 150 MB = 5250 TB / day
Total content size = 180 + 5250 = 5430 TB
The Total Space required for a Year:
5430 TB/day * 365 (days a year) = 1981950 TB = 1981.95 PetaBytes

3.2 Bandwidth Estimation
5430 TB/(24 * 60* 60) = 5430 TB/86400 sec ~= 62.84 GB/s ~= 502.8 Gbps
Incoming bandwidth ~= 502.8 Gbps

Required outgoing bandwidth ~= 100 * 502.8 Gbps ~= 50.28 Tbps

The author notes how a smaller model can be beneficial for deployment purposes by mentioning the following points about Instagram's system design which prioritizes scalability and user experience over other factors like performance:
* Reducer replication is used instead of single-instances, allowing multiple reducers to work together on different parts. This allows them to scale more easily with additional resources if needed in the future without having too many servers running at once when not required by users' needs or requests from other services within their system architecture;
* The author also mentions how they use a single instance for each service, which means that there will always be only one copy of any given function available across all regions. This allows them to easily scale up resources as needed without worrying about overloading servers with too many functions running at once when not required by users' needs or requests from other services within their system architecture;

3.1 Storage Per Day
Photos: 60 million photos/day * 3 MB = 180 TeraBytes / day
Videos: 35 million videos/day * 150 MB = 5250 TB / day
Total content size = 180 + 5250 = 5430 TB
The Total Space required for a Year:
5430 TB/day * 365 (days a year) = 1981950 TB = 1981.95 PetaBytes

3.2 Bandwidth Estimation
5430 TB/(24 * 60* 60) = 5430 TB/86400 sec ~= 62.84 GB/s ~= 502.8 Gbps
Incoming bandwidth ~= 502.8 Gbps
Let’s say the ratio of readers to writers is 100:1.
Required outgoing bandwidth ~= 100 * 502.8 Gbps ~= 50.28 Tbps

10. Scalability for Instagram System Design
Scalability refers to the ability of an organization (or a system, such as a computer network) to perform well under an increased or expanding workload. A system that scales well will be able to maintain or increase its level of performance even as it is tested by larger and larger operational demands.

We can add more servers to application service layers to make the scalability better and handle numerous requests from the clients. We can also increase the number of databases to store the growing users’ data.

Is there any mention of training AI models in cloud regions with lower carbon intensity?,"These requirements has been covered:
Scalability: We can add more servers to application service layers to make the scalability better and handle numerous requests from the clients. We can also increase the number of databases to store the growing users’ data.
Latency: The use of cache and CDNs have reduced the content fetching time.
Availability: We have made the system available to the users by using the storage and databases that are replicated across the globe.
Durability: We have persistent storage that maintains the backup of the data so any uploaded content (photos and videos) never gets lost.
Consistency: We have used storage like blob stores and databases to keep our data consistent globally.

Is there any mention of selecting the right hardware or VM instance types?,"Notification Service:
Informs users about relevant events like likes, comments, mentions, and follows.
Pushes notifications to mobile devices through platforms like Firebase Cloud Messaging or Amazon SNS.
Leverages a queueing system for asynchronous notification delivery.
Analytics Service:
Tracks user engagement, post performance, and overall platform usage.
Gathers data on views, likes, comments, shares, and clicks.
Provides insights to improve user experience, optimize content recommendations, and target advertising.
Why we need caching for storing the data?
Cache the data to handle millions of reads. It improves the user experience by making the fetching process fast. We’ll also opt for lazy loading, which minimizes the client’s waiting time.
