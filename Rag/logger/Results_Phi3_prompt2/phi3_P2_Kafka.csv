In Kafka, the main unit of data is the topic. Users can create and name each topic. They can also delete them, but it is not possible to rename a topic directly. Instead, to rename a topic, the user must create a new topic, move the messages from the original topic to the new, and then delete the original.

In Kafka, the main unit of data is the topic. Users can create and name each topic. They can also delete them, but it is not possible to rename a topic directly. Instead, to rename a topic, the user must create a new topic, move the messages from the original topic to the new, and then delete the original. With this in mind, it is recommended to define logical spaces, based on an hierarchical topic naming structure. This setup can then be combined with security features, such as prefixed ACLs, to isolate different spaces and tenants, while also minimizing the administrative overhead for securing the data in the cluster.

It is recommended to perform this verification after installing or changing plugin versions, and the verification can be done automatically in a Continuous Integration environment.

In Kafka, the main unit of data is the topic. Users can create and name each topic. They can also delete them, but it is not possible to rename a topic directly. Instead, to rename a topic, the user must create a new topic, move the messages from the original topic to the new, and then delete the original. With this in mind, it is recommended to define logical spaces, based on an hierarchical topic naming structure. This setup can then be combined with security features, such as prefixed ACLs, to isolate different spaces and tenants, while also minimizing the administrative overhead for securing the data in the cluster.

In Kafka, the main unit of data is the topic. Users can create and name each topic. They can also delete them, but it is not possible to rename a topic directly.

In Kafka, the main unit of data is the topic. Users can create and name each topic. They can also delete them, but it is not possible to rename a topic directly.

In Kafka, the main unit of data is the topic. Users can create and name each topic. They can also delete them, but it is not possible to rename a topic directly. Instead, to rename a topic, the user must create a new topic, move the messages from the original topic to the new, and then delete the original. With this in mind, it is recommended to define logical spaces, based on an hierarchical topic naming structure. This setup can then be combined with security features, such as prefixed ACLs, to isolate different spaces and tenants, while also minimizing the administrative overhead for securing the data in the cluster.

In Kafka, the main unit of data is the topic. Users can create and name each topic. They can also delete them, but it is not possible to rename a topic directly. Instead, to rename a topic, the user must create a new topic, move the messages from the original topic to the new, and then delete the original. With this in mind, it is recommended to define logical spaces, based on an hierarchical topic naming structure. This setup can then be combined with security features, such as prefixed ACLs, to isolate different spaces and tenants, while also minimizing the administrative overhead for securing the data in the cluster.

Instead, to rename a topic, the user must create a new topic, move the messages from the original topic to the new, and then delete the original. With this in mind, it is recommended to define logical spaces, based on an hierarchical topic naming structure. This setup can then be combined with security features, such as prefixed ACLs, to isolate different spaces and tenants, while also minimizing the administrative overhead for securing the data in the cluster.

Our protocol for allowing a replica to rejoin the ISR ensures that before rejoining, it must fully re-sync again even if it lost unflushed data in its crash.

When used together, min.insync.replicas and acks allow you to enforce greater durability guarantees. A typical scenario would be to create a topic with a replication factor of 3, set min.insync.replicas to 2, and produce with acks of ""all"". This will ensure that the producer raises an exception if a majority of replicas do not receive a write.
