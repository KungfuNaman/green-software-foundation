Does the application/framework use content delivery networks (CDNs) to minimize recomputation or fetching of static data?,"To summarize, metadata checkpointing is primarily needed for recovery from driver failures, whereas data or RDD checkpointing is necessary even for basic functioning if stateful transformations are used.

---

The stateful operations in Structured Streaming queries rely on the preferred location feature of Spark’s RDD to run the state store provider on the same executor. If in the next batch the corresponding state store provider is scheduled on this executor again, it could reuse the previous states and save the time of loading checkpointed states.

---

In specific cases where the amount of data that needs to be retained for the streaming application is not large, it may be feasible to persist data (both types) as deserialized objects without incurring excessive GC overheads. For example, if you are using batch intervals of a few seconds and no window operations, then you can try disabling serialization in persisted data by explicitly setting the storage level accordingly. This would reduce the CPU overheads due to serialization, potentially improving performance without too much GC overheads.

The mask operator constructs a subgraph by returning a graph that contains the vertices and edges that are also found in the input graph.
