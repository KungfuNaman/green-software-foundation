10. Scalability for Instagram System Design
Scalability refers to the ability of an organization (or a system, such as a computer network) to perform well under an increased or expanding workload. A system that scales well will be able to maintain or increase its level of performance even as it is tested by larger and larger operational demands.

We can add more servers to application service layers to make the scalability better and handle numerous requests from the clients. We can also increase the number of databases to store the growing users’ data.

Notification Service:
Informs users about relevant events like likes, comments, mentions, and follows.
Pushes notifications to mobile devices through platforms like Firebase Cloud Messaging or Amazon SNS.
Leverages a queueing system for asynchronous notification delivery.
Analytics Service:
Tracks user engagement, post performance, and overall platform usage.
Gathers data on views, likes, comments, shares, and clicks.
Provides insights to improve user experience, optimize content recommendations, and target advertising.
Why we need caching for storing the data?
Cache the data to handle millions of reads. It improves the user experience by making the fetching process fast. We’ll also opt for lazy loading, which minimizes the client’s waiting time.

8.5 Which Database we should select for Data storing?
It is essential to choose the right kind of database for our Instagram system, but which is the right choice — SQL or NoSQL? Our data is inherently relational, and we need an order for the data (posts should appear in chronological order) and no data loss even in case of failures (data durability). Moreover, in our case, we would benefit from relational queries like fetching the followers or images based on a user ID. Hence, SQL-based databases fulfill these requirements.

10. Scalability for Instagram System Design
Scalability refers to the ability of an organization (or a system, such as a computer network) to perform well under an increased or expanding workload. A system that scales well will be able to maintain or increase its level of performance even as it is tested by larger and larger operational demands.

We can add more servers to application service layers to make the scalability better and handle numerous requests from the clients. We can also increase the number of databases to store the growing users’ data.

10. Scalability for Instagram System Design
Scalability refers to the ability of an organization (or a system, such as a computer network) to perform well under an increased or expanding workload. A system that scales well will be able to maintain or increase its level of performance even as it is tested by larger and larger operational demands.

We can add more servers to application service layers to make the scalability better and handle numerous requests from the clients. We can also increase the number of databases to store the growing users’ data.

Our data is inherently relational, and we need an order for the data (posts should appear in chronological order) and no data loss even in case of failures (data durability). Moreover, in our case, we would benefit from relational queries like fetching the followers or images based on a user ID. Hence, SQL-based databases fulfill these requirements.

Scalability refers to the ability of an organization (or a system, such as a computer network) to perform well under an increased or expanding workload. A system that scales well will be able to maintain or increase its level of performance even as it is tested by larger and larger operational demands.

We can add more servers to application service layers to make the scalability better and handle numerous requests from the clients. We can also increase the number of databases to store the growing users’ data.

8.5 Which Database we should select for Data storing?
It is essential to choose the right kind of database for our Instagram system, but which is the right choice — SQL or NoSQL? Our data is inherently relational, and we need an order for the data (posts should appear in chronological order) and no data loss even in case of failures (data durability). Moreover, in our case, we would benefit from relational queries like fetching the followers or images based on a user ID. Hence, SQL-based databases fulfill these requirements.

Notification Service:
Informs users about relevant events like likes, comments, mentions, and follows.
Pushes notifications to mobile devices through platforms like Firebase Cloud Messaging or Amazon SNS.
Leverages a queueing system for asynchronous notification delivery.
Analytics Service:
Tracks user engagement, post performance, and overall platform usage.
Gathers data on views, likes, comments, shares, and clicks.
Provides insights to improve user experience, optimize content recommendations, and target advertising.
Why we need caching for storing the data?
Cache the data to handle millions of reads. It improves the user experience by making the fetching process fast. We’ll also opt for lazy loading, which minimizes the client’s waiting time.

8.5 Which Database we should select for Data storing?
It is essential to choose the right kind of database for our Instagram system, but which is the right choice — SQL or NoSQL? Our data is inherently relational, and we need an order for the data (posts should appear in chronological order) and no data loss even in case of failures (data durability). Moreover, in our case, we would benefit from relational queries like fetching the followers or images based on a user ID. Hence, SQL-based databases fulfill these requirements.

8.5 Which Database we should select for Data storing?
It is essential to choose the right kind of database for our Instagram system, but which is the right choice — SQL or NoSQL? Our data is inherently relational, and we need an order for the data (posts should appear in chronological order) and no data loss even in case of failures (data durability). Moreover, in our case, we would benefit from relational queries like fetching the followers or images based on a user ID. Hence, SQL-based databases fulfill these requirements.

10. Scalability for Instagram System Design
Scalability refers to the ability of an organization (or a system, such as a computer network) to perform well under an increased or expanding workload. A system that scales well will be able to maintain or increase its level of performance even as it is tested by larger and larger operational demands.

We can add more servers to application service layers to make the scalability better and handle numerous requests from the clients. We can also increase the number of databases to store the growing users’ data.

10. Scalability for Instagram System Design
Scalability refers to the ability of an organization (or a system, such as a computer network) to perform well under an increased or expanding workload. A system that scales well will be able to maintain or increase its level of performance even as it is tested by larger and larger operational demands.

We can add more servers to application service layers to make the scalability better and handle numerous requests from the clients. We can also increase the number of databases to store the growing users’ data.

8.5 Which Database we should select for Data storing?
It is essential to choose the right kind of database for our Instagram system, but which is the right choice — SQL or NoSQL? Our data is inherently relational, and we need an order for the data (posts should appear in chronological order) and no data loss even in case of failures (data durability). Moreover, in our case, we would benefit from relational queries like fetching the followers or images based on a user ID. Hence, SQL-based databases fulfill these requirements.

Scalability refers to the ability of an organization (or a system, such as a computer network) to perform well under an increased or expanding workload. A system that scales well will be able to maintain or increase its level of performance even as it is tested by larger and larger operational demands.

We can add more servers to application service layers to make the scalability better and handle numerous requests from the clients. We can also increase the number of databases to store the growing users’ data.

Microservices – also known as the microservice architecture – is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of services that are:

Independently deployable
Loosely coupled
Organized around business capabilities
Owned by a small team
The microservice architecture enables an organization to deliver large, complex applications rapidly, frequently, reliably and sustainably – a necessity for competing and winning in today’s world.

Reliability: The system must be able to tolerate hardware and software failures.
3. Capacity Estimation for Instagram System Design
We have 1 billion users, with 500 million as daily active users. Assume 60 million photos and 35 million videos are shared on Instagram per day. We can consider 3 MB as the maximum size of each photo and 150 MB as the maximum size of each video uploaded on Instagram.On average, each user sends 20 requests (of any type) per day to our service.

---

It allows us to load the content when the user scrolls and therefore save the bandwidth and focus on loading the content the user is currently viewing. It improves the latency to view or search a particular photo or video on Instagram.
6. High-Level Design(HLD) for Instagram System Design
Our system should allow us to upload, view, and search images and videos at a high level. To upload images and videos, we need to store them, and upon fetching, we need to retrieve the data from the storage. Moreover, the users should also be allowed to follow each other.

---

3.1 Storage Per Day
Photos: 60 million photos/day * 3 MB = 180 TeraBytes / day
Videos: 35 million videos/day * 150 MB = 5250 TB / day
Total content size = 180 + 5250 = 5430 TB
The Total Space required for a Year:
5430 TB/day * 365 (days a year) = 1981950 TB = 1981.95 PetaBytes

3.2 Bandwidth Estimation
5430 TB/(24 * 60* 60) = 5430 TB/86400 sec ~= 62.84 GB/s ~= 502.8 Gbps
Incoming bandwidth ~= 502.8 Gbps
Let’s say the ratio of readers to writers is 100:1.
Required outgoing bandwidth ~= 100 * 502.8 Gbps ~= 50.28 Tbps
