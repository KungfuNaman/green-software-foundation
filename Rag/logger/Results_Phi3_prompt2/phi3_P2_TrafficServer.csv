Example Scenario¶
In this guide, we will use the fictional company Acme Widgets as a basis for the configuration examples. Acme Widgets has a product brochure website (assumed to reside at the domain www.acme.com) that performs very poorly. The content management software they chose takes an unbearable amount of time to generate pages on every request and their engineering team has chosen Traffic Server as a caching proxy layer to improve site performance.

Separately, Acme Widgets has decided to use Traffic Server to help improve the performance of their office’s Internet access, which is hobbled by their reliance on an aging leased line and certain employees’ predilection for extracurricular web browsing.

In our Acme Widgets scenario, they ultimately decide to deploy Traffic Server at which point, since they are running both Traffic Server and their origin web server on the same host, they reconfigure their origin service to listen on port 8080 instead of the default, and change Traffic Server to bind to 80 itself. Updating the remap is thus required, and it should now be:

Now all requests made to www.acme.com are received by Traffic Server which knows to proxy those requests to localhost:8080 if it cannot already serve them from its cache.

Finally, if Acme Widgets decides to secure their site with https, they will need two additional remap rules to handle the https requests. Traffic Server can translate an inbound https request to an http request to origin. So, they would have additional remap rules like:

In our Acme Widgets scenario, they ultimately decide to deploy Traffic Server at which point, since they are running both Traffic Server and their origin web server on the same host, they reconfigure their origin service to listen on port 8080 instead of the default, and change Traffic Server to bind to 80 itself. Updating the remap is thus required, and it should now be:

map http://www.acme.com/ http://localhost:8080/
Now all requests made to www.acme.com are received by Traffic Server which knows to proxy those requests to localhost:8080 if it cannot already serve them from its cache. Because we enabled pristine host headers earlier, the origin service will continue to receive Host: www.acme.com in the HTTP request.

In our Acme Widgets scenario, they ultimately decide to deploy Traffic Server at which point, since they are running both Traffic Server and their origin web server on the same host, they reconfigure their origin service to listen on port 8080 instead of the default, and change Traffic Server to bind to 80 itself.

Transparent Proxy
A transparent proxy may be either a reverse or forward proxy (though nearly all reverse proxies are deployed transparently), the defining feature being the use of network routing to send requests through the proxy without any need for clients to configure themselves to do so, and often without the ability for those clients to bypass the proxy.

For a more complete list of definitions, please see the Glossary.

Finally, if Acme Widgets decides to secure their site with https, they will need two additional remap rules to handle the https requests. Traffic Server can translate an inbound https request to an http request to origin. So, they would have additional remap rules like:

map https://www.acme.com/ http://localhost:8080/
map https://static.acme.com/ https://origin-static.acme.com/
This will require installing a certificate, and adding a line to ssl_multicert.config. Assuming the cert has the static.acme.com alternate name, and that cert should be presented by default:

dest_ip=* ssl_cert_name=/path/to/secret/privatekey/acme.rsa

---

Example Scenario¶
In this guide, we will use the fictional company Acme Widgets as a basis for the configuration examples. Acme Widgets has a product brochure website (assumed to reside at the domain www.acme.com) that performs very poorly. The content management software they chose takes an unbearable amount of time to generate pages on every request and their engineering team has chosen Traffic Server as a caching proxy layer to improve site performance.

Separately, Acme Widgets has decided to use Traffic Server to help improve the performance of their office’s Internet access, which is hobbled by their reliance on an aging leased line and certain employees’ predilection for extracurricular web browsing.

---

In our Acme Widgets scenario, they ultimately decide to deploy Traffic Server at which point, since they are running both Traffic Server and their origin web server on the same host, they reconfigure their origin service to listen on port 8080 instead of the default, and change Traffic Server to bind to 80 itself. Updating the remap is thus required, and it should now be:

map http://www.acme.com/ http://localhost:8080/
Now all requests made to www.acme.com are received by Traffic Server which knows to proxy those requests to localhost:8080 if it cannot already serve them from its cache. Because we enabled pristine host headers earlier, the origin service will continue to receive Host: www.acme.com in the HTTP request.",2.3993282318115234," Judgement: Not Applicable

Transparent Proxy
A transparent proxy may be either a reverse or forward proxy (though nearly all reverse proxies are deployed transparently), the defining feature being the use of network routing to send requests through the proxy without any need for clients to configure themselves to do so, and often without the ability for those clients to bypass the proxy.

For a more complete list of definitions, please see the Glossary.

---

With transparent proxying, clients require no configuration and may be given no option to bypass the proxy. This configuration requires your network to route all requests automatically to the proxy.

Finally, if Acme Widgets decides to secure their site with https, they will need two additional remap rules to handle the https requests. Traffic Server can translate an inbound https request to an http request to origin. So, they would have additional remap rules like:

map https://www.acme.com/ http://localhost:8080/
map https://static.acme.com/ https://origin-static.acme.com/
This will require installing a certificate, and adding a line to ssl_multicert.config. Assuming the cert has the static.acme.com alternate name, and that cert should be presented by default:

Acme Widgets has a product brochure website (assumed to reside at the domain www.acme.com) that performs very poorly. The content management software they chose takes an unbearable amount of time to generate pages on every request and their engineering team has chosen Traffic Server as a caching proxy layer to improve site performance.

Separately, Acme Widgets has decided to use Traffic Server to help improve the performance of their office’s Internet access, which is hobbled by their reliance on an aging leased line and certain employees’ predilection for extracurricular web browsing.

In our Acme Widgets scenario, they ultimately decide to deploy Traffic Server at which point, since they are running both Traffic Server and their origin web server on the same host, they reconfigure their origin service to listen on port 8080 instead of the default, and change Traffic Server to bind to 80 itself. Updating the remap is thus required, and it should now be:

map http://www.acme.com/ http://localhost:8080/
Now all requests made to www.acme.com are received by Traffic Server which knows to proxy those requests to localhost:8080 if it cannot already serve them from its cache. Because we enabled pristine host headers earlier, the origin service will continue to receive Host: www.acme.com in the HTTP request.

Finally, if Acme Widgets decides to secure their site with https, they will need two additional remap rules to handle the https requests. Traffic Server can translate an inbound https request to an http request to origin. So, they would have additional remap rules like:

map https://www.acme.com/ http://localhost:8080/

Finally, if Acme Widgets decides to secure their site with https, they will need two additional remap rules to handle the https requests. Traffic Server can translate an inbound https request to an http request to origin. So, they would have additional remap rules like:

map https://www.acme.com/ http://localhost:8080/
map https://static.acme.com/ https://origin-static.acme.com/
This will require installing a certificate, and adding a line to ssl_multicert.config. Assuming the cert has the static.acme.com alternate name, and that cert should be presented by default:

dest_ip=* ssl_cert_name=/path/to/secret/privatekey/acme.rsa
Further information about configuring Traffic Server for TLS can be found Basic SSL Termination section of the documentation.

With transparent proxying, clients require no configuration and may be given no option to bypass the proxy. This configuration requires your network to route all requests automatically to the proxy.

Transparent Proxy
A transparent proxy may be either a reverse or forward proxy (though nearly all reverse proxies are deployed transparently), the defining feature being the use of network routing to send requests through the proxy without any need for clients to configure themselves to do so, and often without the ability for those clients to bypass the proxy.

For a more complete list of definitions, please see the Glossary.

This configures Traffic Server to bind itself to the port 8080 for HTTP traffic, for both IPv4 and IPv6.

Configure Origin Location¶

This is achieved by writing remap rules, which make use of the core Configuration Remap Plugin.

Transparent Proxy
A transparent proxy may be either a reverse or forward proxy (though nearly all reverse proxies are deployed transparently), the defining feature being the use of network routing to send requests through the proxy without any need for clients to configure themselves to do so, and often without the ability for those clients to bypass the proxy.

For a more complete list of definitions, please see the Glossary.

---

With transparent proxying, clients require no configuration and may be given no option to bypass the proxy. This configuration requires your network to route all requests automatically to the proxy.

Finally, if Acme Widgets decides to secure their site with https, they will need two additional remap rules to handle the https requests. Traffic Server can translate an inbound https request to an http request to origin. So, they would have additional remap rules like:

map https://www.acme.com/ http://localhost:8080/
map https://static.acme.com/ https://origin-static.acme.com/
This will require installing a certificate, and adding a line to ssl_multicert.config. Assuming the cert has the static.acme.com alternate name, and that cert should be presented by default:

Example Scenario¶
In this guide, we will use the fictional company Acme Widgets as a basis for the configuration examples. Acme Widgets has a product brochure website (assumed to reside at the domain www.acme.com) that performs very poorly. The content management software they chose takes an unbearable amount of time to generate pages on every request and their engineering team has chosen Traffic Server as a caching proxy layer to improve site performance.

Separately, Acme Widgets has decided to use Traffic Server to help improve the performance of their office’s Internet access, which is hobbled by their reliance on an aging leased line and certain employees’ predilection for extracurricular web browsing.

---

In our Acme Widgets scenario, they ultimately decide to deploy Traffic Server at which point, since they are running both Traffic Server and their origin web server on the same host, they reconfigure their origin service to listen on port 8080 instead of the default, and change Traffic Server to bind to 80 itself. Updating the remap is thus required, and it should now be:

map http://www.acme.com/ http://localhost:8080/
Now all requests made to www.acme.com are received by Traffic Server which knows to proxy those requests to localhost:8080 if it cannot already serve them from its cache.

Example Scenario¶
In this guide, we will use the fictional company Acme Widgets as a basis for the configuration examples. Acme Widgets has a product brochure website (assumed to reside at the domain www.acme.com) that performs very poorly. The content management software they chose takes an unbearable amount of time to generate pages on every request and their engineering team has chosen Traffic Server as a caching proxy layer to improve site performance.

Separately, Acme Widgets has decided to use Traffic Server to help improve the performance of their office’s Internet access, which is hobbled by their reliance on an aging leased line and certain employees’ predilection for extracurricular web browsing.

Finally, if Acme Widgets decides to secure their site with https, they will need two additional remap rules to handle the https requests. Traffic Server can translate an inbound https request to an http request to origin. So, they would have additional remap rules like:

The content management software they chose takes an unbearable amount of time to generate pages on every request and their engineering team has chosen Traffic Server as a caching proxy layer to improve site performance.

Separately, Acme Widgets has decided to use Traffic Server to help improve the performance of their office’s Internet access, which is hobbled by their reliance on an aging leased line and certain employees’ predilection for extracurricular web browsing.

In our Acme Widgets scenario, they ultimately decide to deploy Traffic Server at which point, since they are running both Traffic Server and their origin web server on the same host, they reconfigure their origin service to listen on port 8080 instead of the default, and change Traffic Server to bind to 80 itself. Updating the remap is thus required, and it should now be:

map http://www.acme.com/ http://localhost:8080/
Now all requests made to www.acme.com are received by Traffic Server which knows to proxy those requests to localhost:8080 if it cannot already serve them from its cache. Because we enabled pristine host headers earlier, the origin service will continue to receive Host: www.acme.com in the HTTP request.

---

map http://www.acme.com/ http://localhost:80/
With this mapping rule, all paths that Traffic Server receives with a Host: header of www.acme.com will be proxied to localhost:80.

Finally, if Acme Widgets decides to secure their site with https, they will need two additional remap rules to handle the https requests. Traffic Server can translate an inbound https request to an http request to origin. So, they would have additional remap rules like:

map https://www.acme.com/ http://localhost:8080/
map https://static.acme.com/ https://origin-static.acme.com/

Example Scenario¶
In this guide, we will use the fictional company Acme Widgets as a basis for the configuration examples. Acme Widgets has a product brochure website (assumed to reside at the domain www.acme.com) that performs very poorly. The content management software they chose takes an unbearable amount of time to generate pages on every request and their engineering team has chosen Traffic Server as a caching proxy layer to improve site performance.

Separately, Acme Widgets has decided to use Traffic Server to help improve the performance of their office’s Internet access, which is hobbled by their reliance on an aging leased line and certain employees’ predilection for extracurricular web browsing.

In our Acme Widgets scenario, they ultimately decide to deploy Traffic Server at which point, since they are running both Traffic Server and their origin web server on the same host, they reconfigure their origin service to listen on port 8080 instead of the default, and change Traffic Server to bind to 80 itself. Updating the remap is thus required, and it should now be:

Finally, if Acme Widgets decides to secure their site with https, they will need two additional remap rules to handle the https requests. Traffic Server can translate an inbound https request to an http request to origin. So, they would have additional remap rules like:

map https://www.acme.com/ http://localhost:8080/
map https://static.acme.com/ https://origin-static.acme.com/
This will require installing a certificate, and adding a line to ssl_multicert.config. Assuming the cert has the static.acme.com alternate name, and that cert should be presented by default:

dest_ip=* ssl_cert_name=/path/to/secret/privatekey/acme.rsa

In our Acme Widgets scenario, they ultimately decide to deploy Traffic Server at which point, since they are running both Traffic Server and their origin web server on the same host, they reconfigure their origin service to listen on port 8080 instead of the default, and change Traffic Server to bind to 80 itself.

Transparent Proxy
A transparent proxy may be either a reverse or forward proxy (though nearly all reverse proxies are deployed transparently), the defining feature being the use of network routing to send requests through the proxy without any need for clients to configure themselves to do so, and often without the ability for those clients to bypass the proxy.

For a more complete list of definitions, please see the Glossary.

Finally, if Acme Widgets decides to secure their site with https, they will need two additional remap rules to handle the https requests. Traffic Server can translate an inbound https request to an http request to origin. So, they would have additional remap rules like:

map https://www.acme.com/ http://localhost:8080/
map https://static.acme.com/ https://origin-static.acme.com/

In this guide, we will use the fictional company Acme Widgets as a basis for the configuration examples. Acme Widgets has a product brochure website (assumed to reside at the domain www.acme.com) that performs very poorly. The content management software they chose takes an unbearable amount of time to generate pages on every request and their engineering team has chosen Traffic Server as a caching proxy layer to improve site performance.

In our Acme Widgets scenario, they ultimately decide to deploy Traffic Server at which point, since they are running both Traffic Server and their origin web server on the same host, they reconfigure their origin service to listen on port 8080 instead of the default, and change Traffic Server to bind to 80 itself. Updating the remap is thus required, and it should now be:

map http://www.acme.com/ http://localhost:8080/
Now all requests made to www.acme.com are received by Traffic Server which knows to proxy those requests to localhost:8080 if it cannot already serve them from its cache.

Finally, if Acme Widgets decides to secure their site with https, they will need two additional remap rules to handle the https requests. Traffic Server can translate an inbound https request to an http request to origin. So, they would have additional remap rules like:

map https://www.acme.com/ http://localhost:8080/
map https://static.acme.com/ https://origin-static.acme.com/

In this guide, we will use the fictional company Acme Widgets as a basis for the configuration examples. Acme Widgets has a product brochure website (assumed to reside at the domain www.acme.com) that performs very poorly. The content management software they chose takes an unbearable amount of time to generate pages on every request and their engineering team has chosen Traffic Server as a caching proxy layer to improve site performance.

Separately, Acme Widgets has decided to use Traffic Server to help improve the performance of their office’s Internet access, which is hobbled by their reliance on an aging leased line and certain employees’ predilection for extracurricular web browsing.

proxy.config.http.server_ports
This configures Traffic Server to bind itself to the port 8080 for HTTP traffic, for both IPv4 and IPv6.

Configure Origin Location¶
The previous settings enable reverse proxying (and prevent flagrant abuse of it), but now Traffic Server needs to know what to proxy. This is achieved by writing remap rules, which make use of the core Configuration Remap Plugin.

Example Scenario¶
In this guide, we will use the fictional company Acme Widgets as a basis for the configuration examples. Acme Widgets has a product brochure website (assumed to reside at the domain www.acme.com) that performs very poorly. The content management software they chose takes an unbearable amount of time to generate pages on every request and their engineering team has chosen Traffic Server as a caching proxy layer to improve site performance.

Separately, Acme Widgets has decided to use Traffic Server to help improve the performance of their office’s Internet access, which is hobbled by their reliance on an aging leased line and certain employees’ predilection for extracurricular web browsing.

In our Acme Widgets scenario, they ultimately decide to deploy Traffic Server at which point, since they are running both Traffic Server and their origin web server on the same host, they reconfigure their origin service to listen on port 8080 instead of the default, and change Traffic Server to bind to 80 itself. Updating the remap is thus required, and it should now be:

map http://www.acme.com/ http://localhost:8080/
Now all requests made to www.acme.com are received by Traffic Server which knows to proxy those requests to localhost:8080 if it cannot already serve them from its cache. Because we enabled pristine host headers earlier, the origin service will continue to receive Host: www.acme.com in the HTTP request.

Finally, if Acme Widgets decides to secure their site with https, they will need two additional remap rules to handle the https requests. Traffic Server can translate an inbound https request to an http request to origin. So, they would have additional remap rules like:

map https://www.acme.com/ http://localhost:8080/
map https://static.acme.com/ https://origin-static.acme.com/
This will require installing a certificate, and adding a line to ssl_multicert.config. Assuming the cert has the static.acme.com alternate name, and that cert should be presented by default:

In our Acme Widgets scenario, they ultimately decide to deploy Traffic Server at which point, since they are running both Traffic Server and their origin web server on the same host, they reconfigure their origin service to listen on port 8080 instead of the default, and change Traffic Server to bind to 80 itself. Updating the remap is thus required, and it should now be:

map http://www.acme.com/ http://localhost:8080/
Now all requests made to www.acme.com are received by Traffic Server which knows to proxy those requests to localhost:8080 if it cannot already serve them from its cache. Because we enabled pristine host headers earlier, the origin service will continue to receive Host: www.acme.com in the HTTP request.

Transparent Proxy
