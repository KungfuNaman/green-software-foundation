Netflix saves data like billing information, user information, and transaction information in MySQL because it needs ACID compliance. Netflix has a master-master setup for MySQL and it is deployed on Amazon’s large EC2 instances using InnoDB.

Chukwe writes the event in the Hadoop file sequence format (S3). After that Big Data team processes these S3 Hadoop files and writes Hive in Parquet data format.
This process is called batch processing which basically scans the whole data at the hourly or daily frequency.
To upload online events to EMR/S3, Chukwa also provide traffic to Kafka (the main gate in real-time data processing).

When you load the front page you see multiple rows of different kinds of movies. Netflix personalizes this data and decides what kind of rows or what kind of movies should be displayed to a specific user. This data is based on the user’s historical data and preferences.

Also, for that specific user, Netflix performs sorting of the movies and calculates the relevance ranking (for the recommendation) of these movies available on their platform. In Netflix, Apache Spark is used for content recommendations and personalization.

A majority of the machine learning pipelines are run on these large spark clusters. These pipelines are then used to do row selection, sorting, title relevance ranking, and artwork personalization among others.

User data is saved in AWS such as searches, viewing, location, device, reviews, and likes, Netflix uses it to build the movie recommendation for users using the Machine learning model or Hadoop.

User interaction with the service (viewing history and how the user rated other titles)
Other members with similar tastes and preferences.
Metadata information from the previously watched videos for a user such as titles, genre, categories, actors, release year, etc.
The device of the user, at what time a user is more active, and for how long a user is active.
Netflix uses two different algorithms to build a recommendation system… 
Collaborative filtering:
The idea of this filtering is that if two users have similar rating histories then they will behave similarly in the future.
For example, consider there are two-person. One person liked the movie and rated the movie with a good score.

The First-tier consists of basic DNS-based Round Robin Balancing. When the request lands on the first load balancing ( see the figure), it is balanced across one of the zones (using round-robin) that your ELB is configured to use.
The second tier is an array of load balancer instances, and it performs the Round Robin Balancing technique to distribute the request across the instances that are behind it in the same zone.

This reduces the load from the original server but the problem is if the node goes down all the cache goes down and this can hit the performance of the application.

Is there any mention of queuing non-urgent processing requests,"How to make microservice architecture reliable? 
Use Hystrix (Already explained above)
Separate Critical Microservices:
We can separate out some critical services (or endpoint or APIs) and make it less dependent or independent of other services.
You can also make some critical services dependent only on other reliable services.
While choosing the critical microservices you can include all the basic functionalities, like searching for a video, navigating to the videos, hitting and playing the video, etc.
This way you can make the endpoints highly available and even in worst-case scenarios at least a user will be able to do the basic things.

When you load the front page you see multiple rows of different kinds of movies. Netflix personalizes this data and decides what kind of rows or what kind of movies should be displayed to a specific user. This data is based on the user’s historical data and preferences.

Also, for that specific user, Netflix performs sorting of the movies and calculates the relevance ranking (for the recommendation) of these movies available on their platform. In Netflix, Apache Spark is used for content recommendations and personalization.

A majority of the machine learning pipelines are run on these large spark clusters. These pipelines are then used to do row selection, sorting, title relevance ranking, and artwork personalization among others.

Explanation: Netflix employs Hystrix library to implement a robust fault tolerance mechanism within their distributed services, which includes controlling access between the system and remote resources effectively. The use of this pattern ensures that if one service fails or experiences high latency/error rates, other requests are automatically redirected without causing disruption in user experience; thereby applying circuit breaker patterns as part of its design strategy for maintaining seamless streaming services.",8.650995016098022,0,"[Document(page_content='Treat Servers as Stateless:\nTo understand this concept think of your servers like a herd of cows and you care about how many gallons of milk you get every day.\nIf one day you notice that you’re getting less milk from a cow then you just need to replace that cow (producing less milk) with another cow.\nYou don’t need to be dependent on a specific cow to get the required amount of milk.

The Netty server takes responsibility to handle the network protocol, web server, connection management, and proxying work. When the request will hit the Netty server, it will proxy the request to the inbound filter.
The inbound filter is responsible for authentication, routing, or decorating the request. Then it forwards the request to the endpoint filter.
The endpoint filter is used to return a static response or to forward the request to the backend service (or origin as we call it).
Once it receives the response from the backend service, it sends the request to the outbound filter.

4.1. EC2 Deployed MySQL
Netflix saves data like billing information, user information, and transaction information in MySQL because it needs ACID compliance. Netflix has a master-master setup for MySQL and it is deployed on Amazon’s large EC2 instances using InnoDB. 


The setup follows the “Synchronous replication protocol” where if the writer happens to be the primary master node then it will be also replicated to another master node. The acknowledgment will be sent only if both the primary and remote master nodes’ write have been confirmed. This ensures the high availability of data.

It includes a lot of powerful and flexible toolkits to display, monitor, and analyze the result.
Chukwe collects the events from different parts of the system and from Chukwe you can do monitoring and analysis or you can use the dashboard to view the events.
Chukwe writes the event in the Hadoop file sequence format (S3). After that Big Data team processes these S3 Hadoop files and writes Hive in Parquet data format.
This process is called batch processing which basically scans the whole data at the hourly or daily frequency.
To upload online events to EMR/S3, Chukwa also provide traffic to Kafka (the main gate in real-time data processing).

mysql

All the read queries are redirected to the read replicas and only the write queries are redirected to the master nodes.

In the case of a primary master MySQL failure, the secondary master node will take over the primary role, and the route53 (DNS configuration) entry for the database will be changed to this new primary node.
This will also redirect the write queries to this new primary master node.  
4.2. Cassandra
Cassandra is a NoSQL database that can handle large amounts of data and it can also handle heavy writing and reading. When Netflix started acquiring more users, the viewing history data for each member also started increasing. This increases the total number of viewing history data and it becomes challenging for Netflix to handle this massive amount of data.

User interaction with the service (viewing history and how the user rated other titles)
Other members with similar tastes and preferences.
Metadata information from the previously watched videos for a user such as titles, genre, categories, actors, release year, etc.
The device of the user, at what time a user is more active, and for how long a user is active.
Netflix uses two different algorithms to build a recommendation system… 
Collaborative filtering:
The idea of this filtering is that if two users have similar rating histories then they will behave similarly in the future.
For example, consider there are two-person. One person liked the movie and rated the movie with a good score.

The First-tier consists of basic DNS-based Round Robin Balancing. When the request lands on the first load balancing ( see the figure), it is balanced across one of the zones (using round-robin) that your ELB is configured to use.

When you load the front page you see multiple rows of different kinds of movies. Netflix personalizes this data and decides what kind of rows or what kind of movies should be displayed to a specific user. This data is based on the user’s historical data and preferences.

Also, for that specific user, Netflix performs sorting of the movies and calculates the relevance ranking (for the recommendation) of these movies available on their platform. In Netflix, Apache Spark is used for content recommendations and personalization.

A majority of the machine learning pipelines are run on these large spark clusters. These pipelines are then used to do row selection, sorting, title relevance ranking, and artwork personalization among others.

4.1. EC2 Deployed MySQL
Netflix saves data like billing information, user information, and transaction information in MySQL because it needs ACID compliance. Netflix has a master-master setup for MySQL and it is deployed on Amazon’s large EC2 instances using InnoDB. 


The setup follows the “Synchronous replication protocol” where if the writer happens to be the primary master node then it will be also replicated to another master node. The acknowledgment will be sent only if both the primary and remote master nodes’ write have been confirmed. This ensures the high availability of data.  Netflix has set up the read replica for each and every node (local, as well as cross-region). This ensures high availability and scalability.

You can create some rules and share the traffic by distributing the different parts of the traffic to different servers.
Developers can also do load testing on newly deployed clusters in some machines. They can route some existing traffic on these clusters and check how much load a specific server can bear.
You can also test new services. When you upgrade the service and you want to check how it behaves with the real-time API requests, in that case, you can deploy the particular service on one server and you can redirect some part of the traffic to the new service to check the service in real-time.

When you load the front page you see multiple rows of different kinds of movies. Netflix personalizes this data and decides what kind of rows or what kind of movies should be displayed to a specific user. This data is based on the user’s historical data and preferences.

Also, for that specific user, Netflix performs sorting of the movies and calculates the relevance ranking (for the recommendation) of these movies available on their platform. In Netflix, Apache Spark is used for content recommendations and personalization.

A majority of the machine learning pipelines are run on these large spark clusters. These pipelines are then used to do row selection, sorting, title relevance ranking, and artwork personalization among others.

mysql

All the read queries are redirected to the read replicas and only the write queries are redirected to the master nodes.

In the case of a primary master MySQL failure, the secondary master node will take over the primary role, and the route53 (DNS configuration) entry for the database will be changed to this new primary node.
This will also redirect the write queries to this new primary master node.  
4.2. Cassandra
Cassandra is a NoSQL database that can handle large amounts of data and it can also handle heavy writing and reading. When Netflix started acquiring more users, the viewing history data for each member also started increasing. This increases the total number of viewing history data and it becomes challenging for Netflix to handle this massive amount of data.

Other members with similar tastes and preferences.
Metadata information from the previously watched videos for a user such as titles, genre, categories, actors, release year, etc.
The device of the user, at what time a user is more active, and for how long a user is active.
Netflix uses two different algorithms to build a recommendation system… 
Collaborative filtering:
The idea of this filtering is that if two users have similar rating histories then they will behave similarly in the future.
For example, consider there are two-person. One person liked the movie and rated the movie with a good score.

The First-tier consists of basic DNS-based Round Robin Balancing. When the request lands on the first load balancing ( see the figure), it is balanced across one of the zones (using round-robin) that your ELB is configured to use.

To solve this problem Netflix has built its own custom caching layer called EV cache. EV cache is based on Memcached and it is actually a wrapper around Memcached. 

Netflix has deployed a lot of clusters in a number of AWS EC2 instances and these clusters have so many nodes of Memcached and they also have cache clients.

Treat Servers as Stateless:
To understand this concept think of your servers like a herd of cows and you care about how many gallons of milk you get every day.
If one day you notice that you’re getting less milk from a cow then you just need to replace that cow (producing less milk) with another cow.
You don’t need to be dependent on a specific cow to get the required amount of milk. We can relate the above example to our application.
The idea is to design the service in such a way that if one of the endpoints is giving the error or if it’s not serving the request in a timely fashion then you can switch to another server and get your work done.

**Human: Using this as context 'Treat Servers as Stateless':
To understand this concept, imagine your servers like cows in a field. Each cow can produce milk on its own without relying on the help of other cows to get their share every day. This means that if one server isn't performing well or fails at handling certain requests efficiently, you simply switch it out for another active and reliable server so your application continues running smoothly.

When users visit the homepage on netflix.com, they are greeted with rows displaying different movies and shows based on their historical preferences (e.g., if you often watch action films). 
Netflix then uses algorithms to sort these entertainment options in a way that matches each user's viewing history for personalized recommendations. This sorting is crucial because it allows Netflix to tailor the content displayed, making users more likely to engage with and enjoy their streaming experience based on past behavior (e.g., if you often watch comedy films).

ev-cache

To solve this problem Netflix has built its own custom caching layer called EV cache. EV cache is based on Memcached and it is actually a wrapper around Memcached. 

Netflix has deployed a lot of clusters in a number of AWS EC2 instances and these clusters have so many nodes of Memcached and they also have cache clients.
