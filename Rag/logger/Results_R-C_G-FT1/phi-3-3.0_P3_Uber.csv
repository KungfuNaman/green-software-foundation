Is there any mention of minimizing the total number of deployed environments?,"Supply sends the request to the specific server based on the GPS location data. After that, the system draws the circle and filters out all the nearby cabs which meet the rider’s requirements.
After that, the list of the cab is sent to the ETA to calculate the distance between the rider and the cab, not geographically but by the road system.
The sorted ETA is then sent back to the supply system to offer to a driver.
If we need to handle the traffic for the newly added city then we can increase the number of servers and allocate the responsibilities of newly added cities’ cell IDs to these servers.

It maintains consistent hashing to assign the work across the workers. It helps in sharding the application in a way that’s scalable and fault-tolerant.
Ringpop uses RPC (Remote Procedure Call) protocol to make calls from one server to another server.
Ringpop also uses a SWIM membership protocol/gossip protocol that allows independent workers to discover each other’s responsibilities. This way each server/node knows the responsibility and the work of other nodes.
Ringpop detects the newly added nodes to the cluster and the node which is removed from the cluster. It distributes the loads evenly when a node is added or removed.

1. Trace coverage
Trace coverage spot the missing road segments or incorrect road geometry.
Trace coverage calculation is based on two inputs: map data under testing and historic GPS traces of all Uber rides taken over a certain period of time.
It covers those GPS traces onto the map, comparing and matching them with road segments.
If we find missing road segments (no road is shown) on GPS traces then we take some steps to fix the deficiency.

3.5 How Dispatch System Match the Riders to Drivers?
We have discussed that DISCO divides the map into tiny cells with a unique ID. This ID is used as a sharding key in DISCO. When supply receives the request from demand the location gets updated using the cell ID as a shard key.
These tiny cells’ responsibilities will be divided into different servers lies in multiple regions (consistent hashing).
For example, we can allocate the responsibility of 12 tiny cells to 6 different servers (2 cells for each server) lying in 6 different regions.

The database should be horizontally scalable. You can linearly add capacity by adding more servers.
It should be able to handle a lot of reads and writes because once every 4-second cabs will be sending the GPS location and that location will be updated in the database.
The system should never give downtime for any operation. It should be highly available no matter what operation you perform (expanding storage, backup, when new nodes are added, etc).

Supply sends the request to the specific server based on the GPS location data. After that, the system draws the circle and filters out all the nearby cabs which meet the rider’s requirements.
After that, the list of the cab is sent to the ETA to calculate the distance between the rider and the cab, not geographically but by the road system.
The sorted ETA is then sent back to the supply system to offer to a driver.
If we need to handle the traffic for the newly added city then we can increase the number of servers and allocate the responsibilities of newly added cities’ cell IDs to these servers.

We can represent the entire road network on a graph to calculate the ETAs. We can use AI-simulated algorithms or simple Dijkstra’s algorithm to find out the best route in this graph.
In that graph, nodes represent intersections (available cabs), and edges represent road segments.
We represent the road segment distance or the traveling time through the edge weight. We also represent and model some additional factors in our graph such as one-way streets, turn costs, turn restrictions, and speed limits. 
Once the data structure is decided we can find the best route using Dijkstra’s search algorithm which is one of the best modern routing algorithms today. For faster performance, we also need to use OSRM (Open Source Routing Machine) which is based on contraction hierarchies.

The database should be horizontally scalable. You can linearly add capacity by adding more servers.
It should be able to handle a lot of reads and writes because once every 4-second cabs will be sending the GPS location and that location will be updated in the database.
The system should never give downtime for any operation. It should be highly available no matter what operation you perform (expanding storage, backup, when new nodes are added, etc).
Earlier Uber was using the RDBMS PostgreSQL database but due to scalability issues uber switched to various databases. Uber uses a NoSQL database (schemaless) built on top of the MySQL database.

Is there any mention of adopting serverless cloud services?,"ETA is calculated based on the road system (not geographically) and there are a lot of factors involved in computing the ETA (like heavy traffic or road construction).
When a rider requests a cab from a location the app not only identifies the free/idle cabs but also includes the cabs which are about to finish a ride.
It may be possible that one of the cabs which are about to finish the ride is closer to the demand than the cab which is far away from the user. So many Uber cars on the road send GPS locations every 4 seconds, so to predict traffic we can use the driver’s app’s GPS location data.

3.5 How Dispatch System Match the Riders to Drivers?
We have discussed that DISCO divides the map into tiny cells with a unique ID. This ID is used as a sharding key in DISCO. When supply receives the request from demand the location gets updated using the cell ID as a shard key.
These tiny cells’ responsibilities will be divided into different servers lies in multiple regions (consistent hashing).
For example, we can allocate the responsibility of 12 tiny cells to 6 different servers (2 cells for each server) lying in 6 different regions.

In our case, cabs are the supply services and they will be tracked by geolocation (latitude and longitude).
All the active cabs keep on sending the location to the server once every 4 seconds through a web application firewall and load balancer.
The accurate GPS location is sent to the data center through Kafka’s Rest APIs once it passes through the load balancer. Here we use Apache Kafka as the data hub.
Once the latest location is updated by Kafka it slowly passes through the respective worker notes’ main memory.
Also, a copy of the location (state machine/latest location of cabs) will be sent to the database and to the dispatch optimization to keep the latest location updated.

The database should be horizontally scalable. You can linearly add capacity by adding more servers.
It should be able to handle a lot of reads and writes because once every 4-second cabs will be sending the GPS location and that location will be updated in the database.
The system should never give downtime for any operation. It should be highly available no matter what operation you perform (expanding storage, backup, when new nodes are added, etc).

Supply sends the request to the specific server based on the GPS location data. After that, the system draws the circle and filters out all the nearby cabs which meet the rider’s requirements.
After that, the list of the cab is sent to the ETA to calculate the distance between the rider and the cab, not geographically but by the road system.
The sorted ETA is then sent back to the supply system to offer to a driver.
If we need to handle the traffic for the newly added city then we can increase the number of servers and allocate the responsibilities of newly added cities’ cell IDs to these servers.

Is there any mention of regularly scanning for and fixing vulnerabilities?,"ETA is calculated based on the road system (not geographically) and there are a lot of factors involved in computing the ETA (like heavy traffic or road construction).
When a rider requests a cab from a location the app not only identifies the free/idle cabs but also includes the cabs which are about to finish a ride.
It may be possible that one of the cabs which are about to finish the ride is closer to the demand than the cab which is far away from the user. So many Uber cars on the road send GPS locations every 4 seconds, so to predict traffic we can use the driver’s app’s GPS location data.

3.5 How Dispatch System Match the Riders to Drivers?
We have discussed that DISCO divides the map into tiny cells with a unique ID. This ID is used as a sharding key in DISCO. When supply receives the request from demand the location gets updated using the cell ID as a shard key.
These tiny cells’ responsibilities will be divided into different servers lies in multiple regions (consistent hashing).
For example, we can allocate the responsibility of 12 tiny cells to 6 different servers (2 cells for each server) lying in 6 different regions.

Then how does Uber tackle the data center failure?? 

It actually uses driver phones as a source of trip data to tackle the problem of data center failure. 
When The driver’s phone app communicates with the dispatch system or the API call is happening between them, the dispatch system sends the encrypted state digest (to keep track of the latest information/data) to the driver’s phone app.
Every time this state digest will be received by the driver’s phone app. In case of a data center failure, the backup data center (backup DISCO) doesn’t know anything about the trip so it will ask for the state digest from the driver’s phone app and it will update itself with the state digest information received by the driver’s phone app. Untitled Diagram",4.318723917007446, No,5.874614000320435,0,"[Document(page_content='ETA is calculated based on the road system (not geographically) and there are a lot of factors involved in computing the ETA (like heavy traffic or road construction).\nWhen a rider requests a cab from a location the app not only identifies the free/idle cabs but also includes the cabs which are about to finish a ride.\nIt may be possible that one of the cabs which are about to finish the ride is closer to the demand than the cab which is far away from the user.

Supply sends the request to the specific server based on the GPS location data. After that, the system draws the circle and filters out all the nearby cabs which meet the rider’s requirements.
After that, the list of the cab is sent to the ETA to calculate the distance between the rider and the cab, not geographically but by the road system.
The sorted ETA is then sent back to the supply system to offer to a driver.

It may be possible that one of the cabs which are about to finish the ride is closer to the demand than the cab which is far away from the user. So many Uber cars on the road send GPS locations every 4 seconds, so to predict traffic we can use the driver’s app’s GPS location data.

The database should be horizontally scalable. You can linearly add capacity by adding more servers.
It should be able to handle a lot of reads and writes because once every 4-second cabs will be sending the GPS location and that location will be updated in the database.
The system should never give downtime for any operation. It should be highly available no matter what operation you perform (expanding storage, backup, when new nodes are added, etc).
Earlier Uber was using the RDBMS PostgreSQL database but due to scalability issues uber switched to various databases. Uber uses a NoSQL database (schemaless) built on top of the MySQL database.

Then how does Uber tackle the data center failure?? 

It actually uses driver phones as a source of trip data to tackle the problem of data center failure. 
When The driver’s phone app communicates with the dispatch system or the API call is happening between them, the dispatch system sends the encrypted state digest (to keep track of the latest information/data) to the driver’s phone app.
Every time this state digest will be received by the driver’s phone app. In case of a data center failure, the backup data center (backup DISCO) doesn’t know anything about the trip so it will ask for the state digest from the driver’s phone app and it will update itself with the state digest information received by the driver’s phone app. Untitled Diagram

It may be possible that one of the cabs which are about to finish the ride is closer to the demand than the cab which is far away from the user. So many Uber cars on the road send GPS locations every 4 seconds, so to predict traffic we can use the driver’s app’s GPS location data.

All the active cabs keep on sending the location to the server once every 4 seconds through a web application firewall and load balancer.
The accurate GPS location is sent to the data center through Kafka’s Rest APIs once it passes through the load balancer. Here we use Apache Kafka as the data hub.
Once the latest location is updated by Kafka it slowly passes through the respective worker notes’ main memory.
Also, a copy of the location (state machine/latest location of cabs) will be sent to the database and to the dispatch optimization to keep the latest location updated.

It maintains consistent hashing to assign the work across the workers. It helps in sharding the application in a way that’s scalable and fault-tolerant.
Ringpop uses RPC (Remote Procedure Call) protocol to make calls from one server to another server.
Ringpop also uses a SWIM membership protocol/gossip protocol that allows independent workers to discover each other’s responsibilities. This way each server/node knows the responsibility and the work of other nodes.
Ringpop detects the newly added nodes to the cluster and the node which is removed from the cluster. It distributes the loads evenly when a node is added or removed. 
3.7 How Does Uber Defines a Map Region?

The database should be horizontally scalable. You can linearly add capacity by adding more servers.
It should be able to handle a lot of reads and writes because once every 4-second cabs will be sending the GPS location and that location will be updated in the database.
The system should never give downtime for any operation. It should be highly available no matter what operation you perform (expanding storage, backup, when new nodes are added, etc).
Earlier Uber was using the RDBMS PostgreSQL database but due to scalability issues uber switched to various databases. Uber uses a NoSQL database (schemaless) built on top of the MySQL database.

1. Trace coverage
Trace coverage spot the missing road segments or incorrect road geometry.
Trace coverage calculation is based on two inputs: map data under testing and historic GPS traces of all Uber rides taken over a certain period of time.
It covers those GPS traces onto the map, comparing and matching them with road segments.
If we find missing road segments (no road is shown) on GPS traces then we take some steps to fix the deficiency.

Then how does Uber tackle the data center failure?? 

It actually uses driver phones as a source of trip data to tackle the problem of data center failure. 
When The driver’s phone app communicates with the dispatch system or the API call is happening between them, the dispatch system sends the encrypted state digest (to keep track of the latest information/data) to the driver’s phone app.
Every time this state digest will be received by the driver’s phone app. In case of a data center failure, the backup data center (backup DISCO) doesn’t know anything about the trip so it will ask for the state digest from the driver’s phone app and it will update itself with the state digest information received by the driver’s phone app. Untitled Diagram",6.106688022613525," In judgement,

Supply sends the request to the specific server based on the GPS location data. After that, the system draws the circle and filters out all the nearby cabs which meet the rider’s requirements.

When a rider requests a cab from a location the app not only identifies the free/idle cabs but also includes the cabs which are about to finish a ride.
It may be possible that one of the cabs which are about to finish the ride is closer to the demand than the cab which is far away from the user. So many Uber cars on the road send GPS locations every 4 seconds, so to predict traffic we can use the driver’s app’s GPS location data.

3.5 How Dispatch System Match the Riders to Drivers?
We have discussed that DISCO divides the map into tiny cells with a unique ID. This ID is used as a sharding key in DISCO. When supply receives the request from demand the location gets updated using the cell ID as a shard key.
These tiny cells’ responsibilities will be divided into different servers lies in multiple regions (consistent hashing).
For example, we can allocate the responsibility of 12 tiny cells to 6 different servers (2 cells for each server) lying in 6 different regions.

It actually uses driver phones as a source of trip data to tackle the problem of data center failure. 
When The driver’s phone app communicates with the dispatch system or the API call is happening between them, the dispatch system sends the encrypted state digest (to keep track of the latest information/data) to the driver’s phone app.

Supply sends the request to the specific server based on the GPS location data. After that, the system draws the circle and filters out all the nearby cabs which meet the rider’s requirements.
After that, the list of the cab is sent to the ETA to calculate the distance between the rider and the cab, not geographically but by the road system.
The sorted ETA is then sent back to the supply system to offer to a driver.
If we need to handle the traffic for the newly added city then we can increase the number of servers and allocate the responsibilities of newly added cities’ cell IDs to these servers.

3.3 Supply Service And How it Works?
In our case, cabs are the supply services and they will be tracked by geolocation (latitude and longitude).
All the active cabs keep on sending the location to the server once every 4 seconds through a web application firewall and load balancer.
The accurate GPS location is sent to the data center through Kafka’s Rest APIs once it passes through the load balancer. Here we use Apache Kafka as the data hub.
Once the latest location is updated by Kafka it slowly passes through the respective worker notes’ main memory.
Also, a copy of the location (state machine/latest location of cabs) will be sent to the database and to the dispatch optimization to keep the latest location updated.

"Is there any mention of selecting a more energy-efficient AI/ML framework, such as those built on programming languages like C/C++?","Earth has a spherical shape so it’s difficult to do summarization and approximation by using latitude and longitude. To solve this problem Uber uses the Google S2 library. This library divides the map data into tiny cells (for example 3km) and gives a unique ID to each cell. This is an easy way to spread data in the distributed system and store it easily.
S2 library gives coverage for any given shape easily. Suppose you want to figure out all the supplies available within a 3km radius of a city.
Using the S2 libraries you can draw a circle of 3km radius and it will filter out all the cells with IDs that lie in that particular circle.
This way you can easily match the rider to the driver and you can easily find out the number of cars(supply) available in a particular region.

Ringpop uses RPC (Remote Procedure Call) protocol to make calls from one server to another server.
Ringpop also uses a SWIM membership protocol/gossip protocol that allows independent workers to discover each other’s responsibilities. This way each server/node knows the responsibility and the work of other nodes.
Ringpop detects the newly added nodes to the cluster and the node which is removed from the cluster. It distributes the loads evenly when a node is added or removed.

The database should be horizontally scalable. You can linearly add capacity by adding more servers.
It should be able to handle a lot of reads and writes because once every 4-second cabs will be sending the GPS location and that location will be updated in the database.
The system should never give downtime for any operation. It should be highly available no matter what operation you perform (expanding storage, backup, when new nodes are added, etc).
Earlier Uber was using the RDBMS PostgreSQL database but due to scalability issues uber switched to various databases. Uber uses a NoSQL database (schemaless) built on top of the MySQL database.

1. Trace coverage
Trace coverage spot the missing road segments or incorrect road geometry.
Trace coverage calculation is based on two inputs: map data under testing and historic GPS traces of all Uber rides taken over a certain period of time.
It covers those GPS traces onto the map, comparing and matching them with road segments.
If we find missing road segments (no road is shown) on GPS traces then we take some steps to fix the deficiency.

Then how does Uber tackle the data center failure?? 

It actually uses driver phones as a source of trip data to tackle the problem of data center failure. 
When The driver’s phone app communicates with the dispatch system or the API call is happening between them, the dispatch system sends the encrypted state digest (to keep track of the latest information/data) to the driver’s phone app.
Every time this state digest will be received by the driver’s phone app. In case of a data center failure, the backup data center (backup DISCO) doesn’t know anything about the trip so it will ask for the state digest from the driver’s phone app and it will update itself with the state digest information received by the driver’s phone app. Untitled Diagram",7.734852075576782," In judgement

Supply sends the request to the specific server based on the GPS location data. After that, the system draws the circle and filters out all the nearby cabs which meet the rider’s requirements.
After that, the list of the cab is sent to the ETA to calculate the distance between the rider and the cab, not geographically but by the road system.
The sorted ETA is then sent back to the supply system to offer to a driver.
If we need to handle the traffic for the newly added city then we can increase the number of servers and allocate the responsibilities of newly added cities’ cell IDs to these servers.

3.5 How Dispatch System Match the Riders to Drivers?
