"If the replication factor is greater than 3, the placement of the 4th and following replicas are determined randomly while keeping the number of replicas per rack below the upper limit (which is basically (replicas - 1) / racks + 2).

Because the NameNode does not allow DataNodes to have multiple replicas of the same block, maximum number of replicas created is the total number of DataNodes at that time.

The existence of a single NameNode in a cluster greatly simplifies the architecture of the system. The NameNode is the arbitrator and repository for all HDFS metadata. The system is designed in such a way that user data never flows through the NameNode.

The File System Namespace
HDFS supports a traditional hierarchical file organization. A user or an application can create directories and store files inside these directories. The file system namespace hierarchy is similar to most other existing file systems; one can create and remove files, move a file from one directory to another, or rename a file. HDFS supports user quotas and access permissions. HDFS does not support hard links or soft links. However, the HDFS architecture does not preclude implementing these features.

---

Replica Selection
To minimize global bandwidth consumption and read latency, HDFS tries to satisfy a read request from a replica that is closest to the reader. If there exists a replica on the same rack as the reader node, then that replica is preferred to satisfy the read request. If HDFS cluster spans multiple data centers, then a replica that is resident in the local data center is preferred over any remote replica.

The time-out to mark DataNodes dead is conservatively long (over 10 minutes by default) in order to avoid replication storm caused by state flapping of DataNodes. Users can set shorter interval to mark DataNodes as stale and avoid stale nodes on reading and/or writing by configuration for performance sensitive workloads.

Cluster Rebalancing
The HDFS architecture is compatible with data rebalancing schemes. A scheme might automatically move data from one DataNode to another if the free space on a DataNode falls below a certain threshold. In the event of a sudden high demand for a particular file, a scheme might dynamically create additional replicas and rebalance other data in the cluster. These types of data rebalancing schemes are not yet implemented.

While HDFS follows naming convention of the FileSystem, some paths and names (e.g. /.reserved and .snapshot ) are reserved. Features such as transparent encryption and snapshot use reserved paths.

The NameNode maintains the file system namespace. Any change to the file system namespace or its properties is recorded by the NameNode. An application can specify the number of replicas of a file that should be maintained by HDFS. The number of copies of a file is called the replication factor of that file.

Introduction
The Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) is a distributed file system designed to run on commodity hardware. It has many similarities with existing distributed file systems.

HDFS provides high throughput access to application data and is suitable for applications that have large data sets.

With this policy, the replicas of a block do not evenly distribute across the racks. Two replicas are on different nodes of one rack and the remaining replica is on a node of one of the other racks. This policy improves write performance without compromising data reliability or read performance.

FS shell is targeted for applications that need a scripting language to interact with the stored data.

DFSAdmin
The DFSAdmin command set is used for administering an HDFS cluster. These are commands that are used only by an HDFS administrator. Here are some sample action/command pairs:","What is the maximum number of replicas created if the total number of DataNodes exceeds the replication factor of 3?
",The maximum number of replicas created is the total number of DataNodes at that time.,2.0,"The provided context provides information about HDFS, its architecture, and some of its properties like replication factor and replica selection. However, it doesn't specify the maximum number of DataNodes in a given cluster or how many replicas are created when the total number of DataNodes exceeds the replication factor of 3.

",3.0,"This question is not directly related to building NLP applications with the Hugging Face ecosystem, as it seems to be about distributed systems and their scaling factors. However, understanding the concepts of scalability, replication, and distributed computing can indirectly benefit developers when designing large-scale NLP models or infrastructure for data processing.

",4.0,"This question can be understood without additional context as it refers to a concept (replication factor, replicas) that is commonly used in distributed systems and data management. However, it assumes familiarity with certain terminologies like DataNodes.
