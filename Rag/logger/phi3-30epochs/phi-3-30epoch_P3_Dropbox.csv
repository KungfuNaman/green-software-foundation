It gives a notification to the indexer and chunker if any action is performed in the files or folders.
Chunker breaks the files into multiple small pieces called chunks and uploads them to the cloud storage with a unique id or hash of these chunks.
To recreate the files these chunks can be joined together. For any changes in the files, the chunking algorithm detects the specific chunk which is modified and only saves that specific part/chunk to the cloud storage.
It reduces bandwidth usage, synchronization time, and storage space in the cloud.
Indexer is responsible for updating the internal database when it receives the notification from the watcher (for any action performed in folders/files).

Horizontal Scaling
We can add more servers behind the load balancer to increase the capacity of each service. This is known as Horizontal Scaling and each service can be independently scaled horizontally in our design.
Database Sharding
Metadata DB is sharded based on object_id. Our hash function will map each object_id to a random server where we can store the file/folder metadata. To query for a particular object_id, service can determine the database server using same hash function and query for data. This approach will distribute our database load to multiple servers making it scalable.

It gives a notification to the indexer and chunker if any action is performed in the files or folders.
Chunker breaks the files into multiple small pieces called chunks and uploads them to the cloud storage with a unique id or hash of these chunks.
To recreate the files these chunks can be joined together. For any changes in the files, the chunking algorithm detects the specific chunk which is modified and only saves that specific part/chunk to the cloud storage.
It reduces bandwidth usage, synchronization time, and storage space in the cloud.
Indexer is responsible for updating the internal database when it receives the notification from the watcher (for any action performed in folders/files).

It handles tasks like routing queries to the appropriate shard, managing transactions across shards, and abstracting the underlying complexities of database sharding.
ORM, within the edge wrapper, enables the application to interact with the database using high-level programming constructs, reducing the need for developers to write complex SQL queries.
This combination of edge wrapper and ORM simplifies database management, making it easier to scale the application horizontally with sharded databases while maintaining a cohesive and developer-friendly interface.

You just need to save the chunk which is updated (this will take less memory and time). It will be easier to keep the different versions of the files in various chunks.
We have considered one file which is divided into various chunks. If there are multiple files then we need to know which chunks belong to which file.
To keep this information we will create one more file named a metadata file. This file contains the indexes of the chunks (chunk names and order information).
You need to mention the hash of the chunks (or some reference) in this metadata file and you need to sync this file into the cloud. We can download the metadata file from the cloud whenever we want and we can recreate the file using various chunks.

Chunker breaks the files into multiple small pieces called chunks and uploads them to the cloud storage with a unique id or hash of these chunks.
To recreate the files these chunks can be joined together. For any changes in the files, the chunking algorithm detects the specific chunk which is modified and only saves that specific part/chunk to the cloud storage.

Request Queue:
This will be a global request queue shared among all the clients.
Whenever a client receives any update or changes in the files/folder it sends the request through the request queue.
This request is received by the synchronization service to update the metadata database.
Response Queue:
There will be an individual response queue corresponding to the individual clients.
The synchronization service broadcast the update through this response queue and this response queue will deliver the updated messages to each client and then these clients will update their respective files accordingly.
The message will never be lost even if the client will be disconnected from the internet (the benefit of using the messaging queue service).

Chunker breaks the files into multiple small pieces called chunks and uploads them to the cloud storage with a unique id or hash of these chunks.

It gives a notification to the indexer and chunker if any action is performed in the files or folders.
Chunker breaks the files into multiple small pieces called chunks and uploads them to the cloud storage with a unique id or hash of these chunks.
To recreate the files these chunks can be joined together. For any changes in the files, the chunking algorithm detects the specific chunk which is modified and only saves that specific part/chunk to the cloud storage.
It reduces bandwidth usage, synchronization time, and storage space in the cloud.
Indexer is responsible for updating the internal database when it receives the notification from the watcher (for any action performed in folders/files).

These basic components are Watcher, Chunker, Indexer, and Internal DB. We have considered only one client but there can be multiple clients belonging to the same user with the same basic components.

Request Queue:
This will be a global request queue shared among all the clients.
Whenever a client receives any update or changes in the files/folder it sends the request through the request queue.
This request is received by the synchronization service to update the metadata database.
Response Queue:
There will be an individual response queue corresponding to the individual clients.
The synchronization service broadcast the update through this response queue and this response queue will deliver the updated messages to each client and then these clients will update their respective files accordingly.
The message will never be lost even if the client will be disconnected from the internet (the benefit of using the messaging queue service).

You just need to save the chunk which is updated (this will take less memory and time). It will be easier to keep the different versions of the files in various chunks.
We have considered one file which is divided into various chunks. If there are multiple files then we need to know which chunks belong to which file.
To keep this information we will create one more file named a metadata file. This file contains the indexes of the chunks (chunk names and order information).
You need to mention the hash of the chunks (or some reference) in this metadata file and you need to sync this file into the cloud. We can download the metadata file from the cloud whenever we want and we can recreate the file using various chunks.

It gives a notification to the indexer and chunker if any action is performed in the files or folders.
Chunker breaks the files into multiple small pieces called chunks and uploads them to the cloud storage with a unique id or hash of these chunks.
To recreate the files these chunks can be joined together. For any changes in the files, the chunking algorithm detects the specific chunk which is modified and only saves that specific part/chunk to the cloud storage.

Non Functional Requirements:
Availability: Availability means what percentage of the time the system is available to take a user’s request. We generally mention availability as 5 Nine’s, 4 Nine’s, etc. 5 Nine’s means 99.999% availability, 4 Nine means 99.99% availability, and so on.
Durability: Durability means the data uploaded by the user should be permanently stored in the database even in case of database failure. Our System should ensure the files uploaded by the user should be permanently stored on the drive without any data loss.
Reliability: Reliability means how many times the system gives the expected output for the same input.
Scalability: With the growing number of users our system should be capable enough to handle the increasing traffic.
