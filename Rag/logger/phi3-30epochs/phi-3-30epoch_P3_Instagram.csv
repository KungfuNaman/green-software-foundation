8. Database Design for Instagram Database Design
We need the following tables to store our data:

---

Availability: The system should be highly available.
Durability: Any uploaded content (photos and videos) should never get lost.
Consistency: We can compromise a little on consistency. It is acceptable if the content (photos or videos) takes time to show in followers’ feeds located in a distant region.
Reliability: The system must be able to tolerate hardware and software failures.
3. Capacity Estimation for Instagram System Design
We have 1 billion users, with 500 million as daily active users. Assume 60 million photos and 35 million videos are shared on Instagram per day. We can consider 3 MB as the maximum size of each photo and 150 MB as the maximum size of each video uploaded on Instagram.On average, each user sends 20 requests (of any type) per day to our service.

Availability: The system should be highly available.
Durability: Any uploaded content (photos and videos) should never get lost.
Consistency: We can compromise a little on consistency. It is acceptable if the content (photos or videos) takes time to show in followers’ feeds located in a distant region.
Reliability: The system must be able to tolerate hardware and software failures.
3. Capacity Estimation for Instagram System Design
We have 1 billion users, with 500 million as daily active users. Assume 60 million photos and 35 million videos are shared on Instagram per day. We can consider 3 MB as the maximum size of each photo and 150 MB as the maximum size of each video uploaded on Instagram.On average, each user sends 20 requests (of any type) per day to our service.

Feed Generation adjusts based on changed relationships.
User monitors activity:
Client checks notifications feed.
Notifications provide updates on relevant events.
Key Design Considerations:

---

Post photos and videos: The users can post photos and videos on Instagram.
Follow and unfollow users: The users can follow and unfollow other users on Instagram.
Like or dislike posts: The users can like or dislike posts of the accounts they follow.
Search photos and videos: The users can search photos and videos based on captions and location.
Generate news feed: The users can view the news feed consisting of the photos and videos (in chronological order) from all the users they follow.
2.2 Non-Functional requirements for Instagram System Design
Scalability: The system should be scalable to handle millions of users in terms of computational resources and storage.
Latency: The latency to generate a news feed should be low.

3.1 Storage Per Day
Photos: 60 million photos/day * 3 MB = 180 TeraBytes / day
Videos: 35 million videos/day * 150 MB = 5250 TB / day
Total content size = 180 + 5250 = 5430 TB
The Total Space required for a Year:
5430 TB/day * 365 (days a year) = 1981950 TB = 1981.95 PetaBytes

3.2 Bandwidth Estimation
5430 TB/(24 * 60* 60) = 5430 TB/86400 sec ~= 62.84 GB/s ~= 502.8 Gbps

10. Scalability for Instagram System Design
Scalability refers to the ability of an organization (or a system, such as a computer network) to perform well under an increased or expanding workload. A system that scales well will be able to maintain or increase its level of performance even as it is tested by larger and larger operational demands.

We can add more servers to application service layers to make the scalability better and handle numerous requests from the clients. We can also increase the number of databases to store the growing users’ data.

3.1 Storage Per Day
Photos: 60 million photos/day * 3 MB = 180 TeraBytes / day
Videos: 35 million videos/day * 150 MB = 5250 TB / day
Total content size = 180 + 5250 = 5430 TB
The Total Space required for a Year:
5430 TB/day * 365 (days a year) = 1981950 TB = 1981.95 PetaBytes

3.2 Bandwidth Estimation
5430 TB/(24 * 60* 60) = 5430 TB/86400 sec ~= 62.84 GB/s ~= 502.8 Gbps
Incoming bandwidth ~= 502.8 Gbps

3.1 Storage Per Day
Photos: 60 million photos/day * 3 MB = 180 TeraBytes / day
Videos: 35 million videos/day * 150 MB = 5250 TB / day
Total content size = 180 + 5250 = 5430 TB
The Total Space required for a Year:
5430 TB/day * 365 (days a year) = 1981950 TB = 1981.95 PetaBytes

3.2 Bandwidth Estimation
5430 TB/(24 * 60* 60) = 5430 TB/86400 sec ~= 62.84 GB/s ~= 502.8 Gbps
Incoming bandwidth ~= 502.8 Gbps

In the above Diagram we have discussed about the use case diagram of Instagram:

---

Availability: The system should be highly available.
Durability: Any uploaded content (photos and videos) should never get lost.
Consistency: We can compromise a little on consistency. It is acceptable if the content (photos or videos) takes time to show in followers’ feeds located in a distant region.
Reliability: The system must be able to tolerate hardware and software failures.
3. Capacity Estimation for Instagram System Design
We have 1 billion users, with 500 million as daily active users. Assume 60 million photos and 35 million videos are shared on Instagram per day. We can consider 3 MB as the maximum size of each photo and 150 MB as the maximum size of each video uploaded on Instagram.On average, each user sends 20 requests (of any type) per day to our service.

3.1 Storage Per Day
Photos: 60 million photos/day * 3 MB = 180 TeraBytes / day
Videos: 35 million videos/day * 150 MB = 5250 TB / day
Total content size = 180 + 5250 = 5430 TB
The Total Space required for a Year:
5430 TB/day * 365 (days a year) = 1981950 TB = 1981.95 PetaBytes

3.2 Bandwidth Estimation
5430 TB/(24 * 60* 60) = 5430 TB/86400 sec ~= 62.84 GB/s ~= 502.8 Gbps
Incoming bandwidth ~= 502.8 Gbps
Let’s say the ratio of readers to writers is 100:1.
Required outgoing bandwidth ~= 100 * 502.8 Gbps ~= 50.28 Tbps

3.1 Storage Per Day
Photos: 60 million photos/day * 3 MB = 180 TeraBytes / day
Videos: 35 million videos/day * 150 MB = 5250 TB / day
Total content size = 180 + 5250 = 5430 TB
The Total Space required for a Year:
5430 TB/day * 365 (days a year) = 1981950 TB = 1981.95 PetaBytes

3.2 Bandwidth Estimation
5430 TB/(24 * 60* 60) = 5430 TB/86400 sec ~= 62.84 GB/s ~= 502.8 Gbps
Incoming bandwidth ~= 502.8 Gbps

10. Scalability for Instagram System Design
Scalability refers to the ability of an organization (or a system, such as a computer network) to perform well under an increased or expanding workload. A system that scales well will be able to maintain or increase its level of performance even as it is tested by larger and larger operational demands.

We can add more servers to application service layers to make the scalability better and handle numerous requests from the clients. We can also increase the number of databases to store the growing users’ data.

Is there any mention of selecting the right hardware or VM instance types?,"Notification Service:
Informs users about relevant events like likes, comments, mentions, and follows.
Pushes notifications to mobile devices through platforms like Firebase Cloud Messaging or Amazon SNS.
Leverages a queueing system for asynchronous notification delivery.
Analytics Service:
Tracks user engagement, post performance, and overall platform usage.
Gathers data on views, likes, comments, shares, and clicks.
Provides insights to improve user experience, optimize content recommendations, and target advertising.
Why we need caching for storing the data?
Cache the data to handle millions of reads. It improves the user experience by making the fetching process fast. We’ll also opt for lazy loading, which minimizes the client’s waiting time.

API Endpoints:

GET /posts/{post_id}: Retrieves details of a post, including the number of likes/dislikes.
POST /posts/{post_id}/like: Registers a like for the post by the authenticated user.
POST /posts/{post_id}/dislike: Registers a dislike for the post by the authenticated user.
DELETE /posts/{post_id}/like: Removes the like for the post by the authenticated user (if previously done).
DELETE /posts/{post_id}/dislike: Removes the dislike for the post by the authenticated user (if previously done).
