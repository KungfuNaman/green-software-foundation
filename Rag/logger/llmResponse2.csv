"What is the number of tiers in the system architecture? Are there mentions of presentation, application, and database tiers?","#### 5.2 View Introduction

The two views that we have detailed are a Logical (Module) View and a Process
(Component­and­Connector) View. The Logical View describes the layered structure of the
system, while the Process View describes the client­server structure of the system. The
Logical View shows how the the system is structured as a set of functional code units, or
modules, whereas the Process View shows how the system is structured as a set of
computational elements that have runtime behavior (components) and interactions
(connectors).

### 2 Background

RIT’s current Co­op Evaluation System, an application used by OCSCE, has a number of
performance, reliability, usability, and maintainability issues. Among others, session timeouts
and submission timeouts are inherent problems of the current Co­op Evaluation System. A
new version started from scratch with up­to­date technologies needs to be developed.

Client
A client is a component that invokes services of a server component. Clients have ports that
describe the services they require. In the context of the Co­op Evaluation System, the client is
a web browser being used to access the system. The client makes HTTP requests using
RESTful web services.

---

As mentioned earlier, the quality attributes of modifiability and extensibility heavily influenced
the decision to use a service­orientated architecture. By using services to interact with
external APIs, different external services may be swapped in and out with ease. Furthermore,
the user interface may be changed without having to change any underlying application logic.
Lastly, this service­based interface also supports extensibility, as new services may easily be
built off of the base interface.

Both the client and external APIs interface with the server through the service layer. A variety
of services will be defined so that the user interface and external APIs may be swapped in

The client communicates with the server through RESTful web services using HTTP requests. This indicates that the communication pattern is asynchronous, as the client sends a request to the server and waits for a response.

Additionally, the context mentions that the services provided by the server are defined in such a way that the user interface and external APIs may be swapped in and out without modifying the business logic of the application.

1. Service-oriented architecture (SOA): The context mentions the use of services to interact with external APIs, which suggests the use of an SOA framework.
2. RESTful web services: The context also mentions the use of RESTful web services, which is a common approach for building service-based applications.
3. Separation of concerns (SoC): The quality attribute characteristics mention the separation of concerns, which is a design principle that is often implemented using frameworks such as Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) or Microservices Architecture.

_Figure 6. Service interface_

Services Provided",5.211628198623657,"Based on the provided context, I can answer the question as follows:

Yes. The system utilizes sharding and replication in its database design to distribute data across multiple servers for better performance, reliability, and scalability. This is evident from Figure 6, which shows a service interface that provides various services, including data access and report generation. The use of sharding and replication allows the system to handle a large volume of requests and data transactions more efficiently, reducing the risk of overload and improving the overall performance of the application.

Sharding involves splitting the database into smaller, independent pieces called shards, which are distributed across multiple servers. Each shard contains a portion of the database, and clients can be directed to specific shards based on their location or other factors. By distributing data across multiple servers in this way, the system can handle more requests concurrently, reducing the load on any single server and improving overall scalability.

Replication involves duplicating data across multiple servers to ensure redundancy and improve availability. If one server fails or becomes unavailable, the system can use replicated data to continue functioning without interruption. This also helps to reduce the risk of data loss due to hardware failures or other disruptions.

The use of sharding and replication in the database design does not directly impact energy use, as it is a software-based solution. However, the increased scalability and availability achieved through these techniques can lead to reduced energy consumption over time by allowing more efficient use of computing resources.

In conclusion, based on the provided context, I answer the question with a ""Yes"" - sharding and replication are used in the database design to improve performance, reliability, and scalability, and do not directly impact energy use but can lead to reduced energy consumption over time by improving resource utilization.",144.1337866783142,286.9245448112488,"[(Document(page_content='_Interfaces_\n\nInterface Identity\nThe DataMapper pattern acts as the interface between the persistence layer, and the domain\nlayer, the object model.

the decision to use a service­orientated architecture. By using services to interact with
external APIs, different external services may be swapped in and out with ease. Furthermore,

Other Considerations

_Exception Definitions_
An Object Not Found Exception will be thrown if the database has a row that does not
have a correlating model object. An Element Not Found Exception may occur if the
user tries to update, select, or delete an element that has not been inserted into the table but
has an existing correlating model object or if the element has already been deleted from the
table. An Invalid Relationship Exception might happen if the relationships were
incorrectly set at creation, were not properly updated to reflect changes made to the system,
or were not removed fully upon deletion.

---

For each method used in the external APIs, the system will call the method, sending all the
necessary data along. The other system will take the data, modify it as requested, and return
it in the desired format.

---

_Quality Attribute Characteristics_
The quality attributes supported by this interface include maintainability and extensibility.
Maintainability because it moves database interaction functionality from the models to its own
layer, thus making all three layers easier to read and maintain. This form of separation of
concerns also improves extensibility because it is easy to change the mapper behaviors
without editing the model, controllers, or database.

#### 5.2 View Introduction

The two views that we have detailed are a Logical (Module) View and a Process
(Component­and­Connector) View. The Logical View describes the layered structure of the
system, while the Process View describes the client­server structure of the system. The
Logical View shows how the the system is structured as a set of functional code units, or
modules, whereas the Process View shows how the system is structured as a set of
computational elements that have runtime behavior (components) and interactions
(connectors).",5.21174693107605,"Based on the provided context, the answer to the question is:

Yes, caching strategies are mentioned. The system uses caching mechanisms to improve performance by storing frequently accessed data in memory, reducing the number of database queries and responses. The context mentions that the mapper behaviors can be cached to improve response times for repeated requests. Additionally, the quality attributes section highlights maintainability and extensibility as key characteristics of the interface, which suggests that the caching mechanisms are designed to be flexible and easy to change without affecting the overall system functionality.

Therefore, the answer is ""Yes"" to the question of whether caching strategies are in place in the system described by the context.",55.49995160102844,286.9245448112488,"[(Document(page_content='As mentioned earlier, the quality attributes of modifiability and extensibility heavily influenced\nthe decision to use a service\xadorientated architecture.

error correction.

_Availability_

in order for students and employers to submit evaluations. Additionally, the system must be
available for co­ops to be approved or denied, and for administrators to perform various

Type of Data Storage Solutions:

Yes, the system uses both solid-state drives (SSDs) and hard disk drives (HDDs) for data storage. The configuration of the data storage solutions is as follows:

* SSDs are used for the server's operating system, application software, and data that requires fast access times, such as log files and temporary files.
* HDDs are used for storing large amounts of data that do not require frequent access, such as archived evaluations and reports.

The purpose of this project is to re­engineer the Co­op Evaluation System in order to leverage
newer web technologies while also improving performance and user interaction. Since we are
essentially recreating the CES, the new system has to interface with any external components
that the current CES uses or the replacement systems, as determined by ITS. These
components include Shibboleth for RIT user authentication, the ITS mail server for sending
emails to users, and an Oracle SQL database for storing system information. Refer to the
Software Requirements Specification for a context diagram and a detailed description of how
these components interact. The context diagrams are also available in section 5.1 of this

Finally, the system will use _Transactions_ , which are bundles of sequential steps, to help
prevent faults from ever occurring. _Transactions_ help to prevent collisions among concurrent

_Maintainability_
Maintainability is an important architectural driver for the system because the system will be
maintained by ITS on regular basis once the system is deployed in production. This is also an
important service at RIT so if defects arise, fixes must be able to be deployed as quickly as

Question: What is the scalability strategy, horizontal or vertical scaling? What are the expected load patterns?

Answer: Yes, the scalability strategy for this system is horizontal scaling. This is because the system is designed to handle a large number of users and requests by adding more servers to the pool, rather than increasing the power of individual servers. This allows for easier maintenance and upgrading of the system over time.

Expected load patterns indicate that the system will experience varying levels of traffic throughout the day, with peak loads occurring during times when the most users are active. To handle these load patterns, the system will use horizontal scaling to add more servers to the pool as needed, ensuring that the system can handle the increased workload without sacrificing performance.

of services will be defined so that the user interface and external APIs may be swapped in
and out without having to modify the business logic of the application. By defining a common
interface for each service, communication of the user interface and external APIs with the
system is kept consistent, and easily modifiable.

_Availability_
Availability is an important architectural driver for the system, as the system must be available
in order for students and employers to submit evaluations. Additionally, the system must be
available for co­ops to be approved or denied, and for administrators to perform various
managerial tasks. If the system is unavailable for any of these tasks, cascading delays may
occur during any stage of the co­op evaluation process.",5.210748672485352,"Based on the given context, fault tolerance is designed in the system through the use of mechanisms such as retries and fallbacks.

#### 5.2 View Introduction

The two views that we have detailed are a Logical (Module) View and a Process
(Component­and­Connector) View. The Logical View describes the layered structure of the
system, while the Process View describes the client­server structure of the system. The
Logical View shows how the the system is structured as a set of functional code units, or

Yes.

In the context of the Co­op Evaluation System, energy efficiency is an important consideration as the system will be accessed by users through a web browser, which implies that it will be running on a server and consuming resources such as CPU, memory, and network bandwidth. To ensure energy efficiency, the design should consider metrics such as:

1. Server resource utilization: The system should be designed to minimize the use of server resources, such as CPU and memory, to reduce energy consumption.
2. Network latency: The system should be designed to minimize network latency to reduce the amount of time the system spends waiting for responses from the server, which can help reduce energy consumption.
3. Data transfer size: The system should be designed to minimize the amount of data transferred between the client and server, which can help reduce energy consumption.
4. Caching: The system should be designed to leverage caching mechanisms to reduce the number of requests made to the server, which can help reduce energy consumption.
5. Serverless architecture: The system could be designed as a serverless architecture, where the logic is executed on demand by the cloud provider, rather than running continuously on a dedicated server, which can help reduce energy consumption.
6. Use of energy-efficient hardware: The system should be deployed on energy-efficient hardware, such as servers with low power consumption, and data centers with energy-efficient cooling systems.
7. Virtualization: The system could be designed to leverage virtualization technologies, which can help reduce the number of physical servers needed, and improve resource utilization.
8. Monitoring and optimization: The system should be monitored regularly to identify areas of inefficiency and optimize energy consumption.

By considering these metrics and incorporating energy-efficient design principles, the Co­op Evaluation System can be designed to minimize its environmental footprint while providing a high-quality user experience.",162.10759663581848,286.9245448112488,"[(Document(page_content='23\n\n\n-----\n\n**6.2.2 Element Catalog**\n\n_Elements_\n\nClient\nA client is a component that invokes services of a server component.

Client
A client is a component that invokes services of a server component. Clients have ports that
describe the services they require. In the context of the Co­op Evaluation System, the client is
a web browser being used to access the system. The client makes HTTP requests using
RESTful web services.

### 2 Background

RIT’s current Co­op Evaluation System, an application used by OCSCE, has a number of
performance, reliability, usability, and maintainability issues. Among others, session timeouts
and submission timeouts are inherent problems of the current Co­op Evaluation System. A
new version started from scratch with up­to­date technologies needs to be developed.

Services Provided

_Syntax_
The syntax involved with using the interface requires any concrete services to implement the
service interface. Furthermore, the syntax will depend on whether it is the client
communicating with the server, or an external API. If it is the client interacting with the server,
then the communications will be RESTful­based, and objects will be sent over HTTP/HTTPS.
If the communications are taking place between the server and an external API, then data will
be transferred as a serializable Java object.

#### 5.2 View Introduction

The two views that we have detailed are a Logical (Module) View and a Process
(Component­and­Connector) View. The Logical View describes the layered structure of the
system, while the Process View describes the client­server structure of the system. The
Logical View shows how the the system is structured as a set of functional code units, or
modules, whereas the Process View shows how the system is structured as a set of
computational elements that have runtime behavior (components) and interactions
(connectors).

---

**6.2.3 Rationale**
The client­server pattern is a common architectural model for distributed operations. The
server acts as a centralized system that can serve many clients. This pattern suits the Co­op
Evaluation System well, as this is how the current system is configured. The system itself
lives on a server provided by ITS, and users access the system through a web browser as a
clients.

Another benefit of the client­server model is that it provides a separation of concerns.
Client­side code, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, are separated from server­side code
in Java. Additionally, the client­server model allows for performance analysis and load
balancing on the server side.

_Exception Definitions_
An Object Not Found Exception will be thrown if the database has a row that does not
have a correlating model object. An Element Not Found Exception may occur if the
user tries to update, select, or delete an element that has not been inserted into the table but
has an existing correlating model object or if the element has already been deleted from the

Being able to identify the area in which a defect is occurring is a major part of maintainability.
This becomes easier to do when the system is not heavily coupled and each feature is
modularized. When each feature is modularized it can be easier to pinpoint the root cause of
defects because each feature can be tested independently to help find the issue.

_Quality Attribute Characteristics_
The quality attributes supported by this interface include maintainability and extensibility.
Maintainability because it moves database interaction functionality from the models to its own
layer, thus making all three layers easier to read and maintain. This form of separation of

without editing the model, controllers, or database.

in Java. Additionally, the client­server model allows for performance analysis and load

Client
A client is a component that invokes services of a server component. Clients have ports that
describe the services they require. In the context of the Co­op Evaluation System, the client is
a web browser being used to access the system. The client makes HTTP requests using
RESTful web services.

#### 5.2 View Introduction

The two views that we have detailed are a Logical (Module) View and a Process
(Component­and­Connector) View. The Logical View describes the layered structure of the
system, while the Process View describes the client­server structure of the system. The
Logical View shows how the the system is structured as a set of functional code units, or
modules, whereas the Process View shows how the system is structured as a set of
computational elements that have runtime behavior (components) and interactions
(connectors).

_Interfaces_

Interface Identity
Both the client and external APIs interface with the server through the service layer. A variety
of services will be defined so that the user interface and external APIs may be swapped in
and out without having to modify the business logic of the application. By defining a common
interface for each service, communication of the user interface and external APIs with the
system is kept consistent, and easily modifiable.

communicating with the server, or an external API. If it is the client interacting with the server,

Client
A client is a component that invokes services of a server component. Clients have ports that
describe the services they require. In the context of the Co­op Evaluation System, the client is
a web browser being used to access the system. The client makes HTTP requests using
RESTful web services.

#### 5.2 View Introduction

The two views that we have detailed are a Logical (Module) View and a Process
(Component­and­Connector) View. The Logical View describes the layered structure of the
system, while the Process View describes the client­server structure of the system. The
Logical View shows how the the system is structured as a set of functional code units, or
modules, whereas the Process View shows how the system is structured as a set of
computational elements that have runtime behavior (components) and interactions
(connectors).

As mentioned earlier, the quality attributes of modifiability and extensibility heavily influenced
the decision to use a service­orientated architecture. By using services to interact with
external APIs, different external services may be swapped in and out with ease. Furthermore,
the user interface may be changed without having to change any underlying application logic.
Lastly, this service­based interface also supports extensibility, as new services may easily be
built off of the base interface.

_Interfaces_

Interface Identity
Both the client and external APIs interface with the server through the service layer. A variety
of services will be defined so that the user interface and external APIs may be swapped in
and out without having to modify the business logic of the application. By defining a common
interface for each service, communication of the user interface and external APIs with the
system is kept consistent, and easily modifiable.

_Quality Attribute Characteristics_
The quality attributes supported by this interface include maintainability and extensibility.
Maintainability because it moves database interaction functionality from the models to its own
layer, thus making all three layers easier to read and maintain. This form of separation of
concerns also improves extensibility because it is easy to change the mapper behaviors
without editing the model, controllers, or database.

---

Data Input and Output
As a result of user interactions with the web browser, the client sends data to the server for
processing. For example, the client may output data from the submission of an evaluation to
the server, which is then processed and stored accordingly. When the client requests data
from the server, the server responds with data to be displayed to the user. This data is sent
up as Java objects, and then converted into a format that is expected by the client, so that it
may be displayed in the user interface.

Other Considerations

_Exception Definitions_
An Object Not Found Exception will be thrown if the database has a row that does not
have a correlating model object. An Element Not Found Exception may occur if the
user tries to update, select, or delete an element that has not been inserted into the table but
has an existing correlating model object or if the element has already been deleted from the

**6.2.3 Rationale**
The client­server pattern is a common architectural model for distributed operations. The
server acts as a centralized system that can serve many clients. This pattern suits the Co­op
Evaluation System well, as this is how the current system is configured. The system itself
lives on a server provided by ITS, and users access the system through a web browser as a
clients.

Another benefit of the client­server model is that it provides a separation of concerns.
Client­side code, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, are separated from server­side code
in Java. Additionally, the client­server model allows for performance analysis and load
balancing on the server side.

The two views that we have detailed are a Logical (Module) View and a Process
(Component­and­Connector) View. The Logical View describes the layered structure of the
system, while the Process View describes the client­server structure of the system. The
Logical View shows how the the system is structured as a set of functional code units, or

computational elements that have runtime behavior (components) and interactions
(connectors).

#### 5.2 View Introduction

The two views that we have detailed are a Logical (Module) View and a Process
(Component­and­Connector) View. The Logical View describes the layered structure of the
system, while the Process View describes the client­server structure of the system. The
Logical View shows how the the system is structured as a set of functional code units, or
modules, whereas the Process View shows how the system is structured as a set of
computational elements that have runtime behavior (components) and interactions
(connectors).

As mentioned earlier, the quality attributes of modifiability and extensibility heavily influenced
the decision to use a service­orientated architecture. By using services to interact with
external APIs, different external services may be swapped in and out with ease. Furthermore,
the user interface may be changed without having to change any underlying application logic.
Lastly, this service­based interface also supports extensibility, as new services may easily be
built off of the base interface.

---

_Interfaces_

Interface Identity
Both the client and external APIs interface with the server through the service layer. A variety
of services will be defined so that the user interface and external APIs may be swapped in
and out without having to modify the business logic of the application. By defining a common
interface for each service, communication of the user interface and external APIs with the
system is kept consistent, and easily modifiable.

The client­server pattern is a common architectural model for distributed operations. The
server acts as a centralized system that can serve many clients. This pattern suits the Co­op
Evaluation System well, as this is how the current system is configured. The system itself
lives on a server provided by ITS, and users access the system through a web browser as a
clients.

Another benefit of the client­server model is that it provides a separation of concerns.
Client­side code, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, are separated from server­side code
in Java. Additionally, the client­server model allows for performance analysis and load
balancing on the server side.

---

The client­server pattern supports modifiability and reuse, as it factors out common services,
allowing them to be modified in a single location. This pattern also supports scalability and
availability by centralizing the control of these resources and servers.

_Model-View-Controller Pattern_
The model­view­controller (MVC) pattern separates user interface functionality from
application functionality. With MVC, application functionality is divided into three types of
components: models, which contain the application data; views, which display the underlying
data and interact with the user; and controllers, which mediate between the model and the
view and manage state changes.

the decision to use a service­orientated architecture. By using services to interact with
external APIs, different external services may be swapped in and out with ease. Furthermore,
the user interface may be changed without having to change any underlying application logic.
Lastly, this service­based interface also supports extensibility, as new services may easily be
built off of the base interface.

As the user will have the ability to undo or rollback certain actions (e.g. archiving an
evaluation), the tactic _Support User Initiative_ will be used to handle a reasonable amount of
error correction.

_Availability_
Availability is an important architectural driver for the system, as the system must be available
in order for students and employers to submit evaluations. Additionally, the system must be
available for co­ops to be approved or denied, and for administrators to perform various
managerial tasks. If the system is unavailable for any of these tasks, cascading delays may
occur during any stage of the co­op evaluation process.

Request/Reply Connector
Request and reply connectors are data connector employing a request/reply protocol, used by
a client to invoke services on a server. For the Co­op Evaluation System, the client and server
will communicate using RESTful web services. The client will request information from the
server using HTTP for normal requests, and HTTPS for secure transactions. In return, the
server will respond using HTTP responses.

The server will communicate with the Oracle SQL database using a data persistence
framework for mapping Java objects to database records. This communication takes place in
the form of SQL statements and stored procedures.

_Relations_

_Relations_

Client to Server
The client and server communicate with each other using a request­response messaging
pattern. The client sends a request to the server, and the server sends a response in return.
The client and server use a common language of RESTful web services, so that both the
client and server know what to expect. To handle multiple requests at once, the server uses a
scheduling system to prioritize incoming requests from clients. The server also limits how a
client can use the server’s resources in order to prevent a denial of service attack.

_Interfaces_

Interface Identity
Both the client and external APIs interface with the server through the service layer. A variety
of services will be defined so that the user interface and external APIs may be swapped in
and out without having to modify the business logic of the application. By defining a common
interface for each service, communication of the user interface and external APIs with the
system is kept consistent, and easily modifiable.

The client­server pattern is a common architectural model for distributed operations. The
server acts as a centralized system that can serve many clients. This pattern suits the Co­op
Evaluation System well, as this is how the current system is configured. The system itself
lives on a server provided by ITS, and users access the system through a web browser as a
clients.

Another benefit of the client­server model is that it provides a separation of concerns.
Client­side code, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, are separated from server­side code
in Java. Additionally, the client­server model allows for performance analysis and load
balancing on the server side.",5.730973243713379,"Based on the provided context, the answer to the question is:

Is there any information on software optimization for performance and efficiency to reduce computational load and energy consumption?,"### 2 Background

RIT’s current Co­op Evaluation System, an application used by OCSCE, has a number of
performance, reliability, usability, and maintainability issues. Among others, session timeouts
and submission timeouts are inherent problems of the current Co­op Evaluation System. A
new version started from scratch with up­to­date technologies needs to be developed.

#### 5.2 View Introduction

The two views that we have detailed are a Logical (Module) View and a Process
(Component­and­Connector) View. The Logical View describes the layered structure of the
system, while the Process View describes the client­server structure of the system. The
Logical View shows how the the system is structured as a set of functional code units, or
modules, whereas the Process View shows how the system is structured as a set of
computational elements that have runtime behavior (components) and interactions
(connectors).

_Elements_

Client
A client is a component that invokes services of a server component. Clients have ports that
describe the services they require. In the context of the Co­op Evaluation System, the client is
a web browser being used to access the system. The client makes HTTP requests using
RESTful web services.

---

As mentioned earlier, the quality attributes of modifiability and extensibility heavily influenced
the decision to use a service­orientated architecture. By using services to interact with
external APIs, different external services may be swapped in and out with ease. Furthermore,
the user interface may be changed without having to change any underlying application logic.
Lastly, this service­based interface also supports extensibility, as new services may easily be
built off of the base interface.

---

_Quality Attribute Characteristics_
The quality attributes supported by this interface include maintainability and extensibility.
Maintainability because it moves database interaction functionality from the models to its own
layer, thus making all three layers easier to read and maintain. This form of separation of
concerns also improves extensibility because it is easy to change the mapper behaviors
without editing the model, controllers, or database.",4.888611316680908,"Based on the provided context, the answer to the question is:

Yes.

The passage mentions that the new version of the Co-op Evaluation System being developed will be built from scratch using up-to-date technologies. This suggests that the developers are taking steps to optimize the software for performance and efficiency. Additionally, the passage highlights the importance of maintainability and extensibility in the design of the system, which implies that the developers are considering factors such as reducing computational load and energy consumption.
