These requirements has been covered:
Scalability: We can add more servers to application service layers to make the scalability better and handle numerous requests from the clients. We can also increase the number of databases to store the growing users’ data.
Latency: The use of cache and CDNs have reduced the content fetching time.
Availability: We have made the system available to the users by using the storage and databases that are replicated across the globe.
Durability: We have persistent storage that maintains the backup of the data so any uploaded content (photos and videos) never gets lost.
Consistency: We have used storage like blob stores and databases to keep our data consistent globally.

Notification Service:
Informs users about relevant events like likes, comments, mentions, and follows.
Pushes notifications to mobile devices through platforms like Firebase Cloud Messaging or Amazon SNS.
Leverages a queueing system for asynchronous notification delivery.
Analytics Service:
Tracks user engagement, post performance, and overall platform usage.
Gathers data on views, likes, comments, shares, and clicks.
Provides insights to improve user experience, optimize content recommendations, and target advertising.
Why we need caching for storing the data?
Cache the data to handle millions of reads. It improves the user experience by making the fetching process fast. We’ll also opt for lazy loading, which minimizes the client’s waiting time.

10. Scalability for Instagram System Design
Scalability refers to the ability of an organization (or a system, such as a computer network) to perform well under an increased or expanding workload. A system that scales well will be able to maintain or increase its level of performance even as it is tested by larger and larger operational demands.

We can add more servers to application service layers to make the scalability better and handle numerous requests from the clients. We can also increase the number of databases to store the growing users’ data.

---

If the user is new, they will register firstly it will be store in database, they will verifiy the profile.
If user is already signup, they will provide the email-Id and Password.
On the home page they will get the photos and videos, as well as the story page.
The post which is posted now, it will come at the top. User can follow or unfollow the person. User can get live. It’s all depend on them.
There will be setting, in which user can see there past story or the post which has been archive. User can unblock the person they can get verified account, after paying.

Microservices – also known as the microservice architecture – is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of services that are:

Independently deployable
Loosely coupled
Organized around business capabilities
Owned by a small team
The microservice architecture enables an organization to deliver large, complex applications rapidly, frequently, reliably and sustainably – a necessity for competing and winning in today’s world.

---

Notification Service:
Informs users about relevant events like likes, comments, mentions, and follows.
Pushes notifications to mobile devices through platforms like Firebase Cloud Messaging or Amazon SNS.
Leverages a queueing system for asynchronous notification delivery.
Analytics Service:
Tracks user engagement, post performance, and overall platform usage.
Gathers data on views, likes, comments, shares, and clicks.
Provides insights to improve user experience, optimize content recommendations, and target advertising.
Why we need caching for storing the data?
Cache the data to handle millions of reads. It improves the user experience by making the fetching process fast. We’ll also opt for lazy loading, which minimizes the client’s waiting time.

---

API Endpoints:

GET /posts/{post_id}: Retrieves details of a post, including the number of likes/dislikes.
POST /posts/{post_id}/like: Registers a like for the post by the authenticated user.
POST /posts/{post_id}/dislike: Registers a dislike for the post by the authenticated user.
DELETE /posts/{post_id}/like: Removes the like for the post by the authenticated user (if previously done).
DELETE /posts/{post_id}/dislike: Removes the dislike for the post by the authenticated user (if previously done).

---

Post photos and videos: The users can post photos and videos on Instagram.
Follow and unfollow users: The users can follow and unfollow other users on Instagram.
Like or dislike posts: The users can like or dislike posts of the accounts they follow.
Search photos and videos: The users can search photos and videos based on captions and location.
Generate news feed: The users can view the news feed consisting of the photos and videos (in chronological order) from all the users they follow.
2.2 Non-Functional requirements for Instagram System Design
Scalability: The system should be scalable to handle millions of users in terms of computational resources and storage.
Latency: The latency to generate a news feed should be low.
Availability: The system should be highly available.

---

If the user is new, they will register firstly it will be store in database, they will verifiy the profile.
If user is already signup, they will provide the email-Id and Password.
On the home page they will get the photos and videos, as well as the story page.
The post which is posted now, it will come at the top. User can follow or unfollow the person. User can get live. It’s all depend on them.
There will be setting, in which user can see there past story or the post which has been archive. User can unblock the person they can get verified account, after paying.
5. Low-Level Design(LLD) for Instagram System Design
design-instagram-lld

Here’s a breakdown of the key components and interactions for Instagram’s low-level design:

---

Availability: The system should be highly available.
Durability: Any uploaded content (photos and videos) should never get lost.
Consistency: We can compromise a little on consistency. It is acceptable if the content (photos or videos) takes time to show in followers’ feeds located in a distant region.
Reliability: The system must be able to tolerate hardware and software failures.
3. Capacity Estimation for Instagram System Design
We have 1 billion users, with 500 million as daily active users. Assume 60 million photos and 35 million videos are shared on Instagram per day. We can consider 3 MB as the maximum size of each photo and 150 MB as the maximum size of each video uploaded on Instagram.On average, each user sends 20 requests (of any type) per day to our service.

API Endpoints:

GET /posts/{post_id}: Retrieves details of a post, including the number of likes/dislikes.
POST /posts/{post_id}/like: Registers a like for the post by the authenticated user.
POST /posts/{post_id}/dislike: Registers a dislike for the post by the authenticated user.
DELETE /posts/{post_id}/like: Removes the like for the post by the authenticated user (if previously done).
DELETE /posts/{post_id}/dislike: Removes the dislike for the post by the authenticated user (if previously done).

These requirements has been covered:
Scalability: We can add more servers to application service layers to make the scalability better and handle numerous requests from the clients. We can also increase the number of databases to store the growing users’ data.
Latency: The use of cache and CDNs have reduced the content fetching time.
Availability: We have made the system available to the users by using the storage and databases that are replicated across the globe.
Durability: We have persistent storage that maintains the backup of the data so any uploaded content (photos and videos) never gets lost.
Consistency: We have used storage like blob stores and databases to keep our data consistent globally.

---

Post photos and videos: The users can post photos and videos on Instagram.
Follow and unfollow users: The users can follow and unfollow other users on Instagram.
Like or dislike posts: The users can like or dislike posts of the accounts they follow.
Search photos and videos: The users can search photos and videos based on captions and location.
Generate news feed: The users can view the news feed consisting of the photos and videos (in chronological order) from all the users they follow.
2.2 Non-Functional requirements for Instagram System Design
Scalability: The system should be scalable to handle millions of users in terms of computational resources and storage.
Latency: The latency to generate a news feed should be low.
Availability: The system should be highly available.

Notification Service:
Informs users about relevant events like likes, comments, mentions, and follows.
Pushes notifications to mobile devices through platforms like Firebase Cloud Messaging or Amazon SNS.
Leverages a queueing system for asynchronous notification delivery.
Analytics Service:
Tracks user engagement, post performance, and overall platform usage.
Gathers data on views, likes, comments, shares, and clicks.
Provides insights to improve user experience, optimize content recommendations, and target advertising.
Why we need caching for storing the data?
Cache the data to handle millions of reads. It improves the user experience by making the fetching process fast. We’ll also opt for lazy loading, which minimizes the client’s waiting time.

Feed Generation adjusts based on changed relationships.
User monitors activity:
Client checks notifications feed.
Notifications provide updates on relevant events.
Key Design Considerations:

---

3.1 Storage Per Day
Photos: 60 million photos/day * 3 MB = 180 TeraBytes / day
Videos: 35 million videos/day * 150 MB = 5250 TB / day
Total content size = 180 + 5250 = 5430 TB
The Total Space required for a Year:
5430 TB/day * 365 (days a year) = 1981950 TB = 1981.95 PetaBytes

3.2 Bandwidth Estimation
5430 TB/(24 * 60* 60) = 5430 TB/86400 sec ~= 62.84 GB/s ~= 502.8 Gbps
Incoming bandwidth ~= 502.8 Gbps
Let’s say the ratio of readers to writers is 100:1.
Required outgoing bandwidth ~= 100 * 502.8 Gbps ~= 50.28 Tbps

4. Use Case Diagram for Instagram System Design
uml
Use Case Diagram Instagram

In the above Diagram we have discussed about the use case diagram of Instagram:

---

User Service:
Handles user registration, login, authentication, and profile management.
Stores user data like username, email, bio, profile picture, etc.
Integrates with social authentication providers (e.g., Facebook, Google).
Post Service:
Handles photo and video uploads, editing, and deletion.
Stores post metadata like caption, hashtags, location, timestamp, etc.Processes uploaded media for resizing, filtering, and thumbnail generation.
Manages photo and video transcoding for different devices and resolutions.
Feed Service:
Generates personalized news feeds for each user based on their follows, likes, activity, and engagement.
Leverages a distributed system like Apache Kafka or RabbitMQ for real-time updates and notifications.

---

If the user is new, they will register firstly it will be store in database, they will verifiy the profile.
If user is already signup, they will provide the email-Id and Password.
On the home page they will get the photos and videos, as well as the story page.
The post which is posted now, it will come at the top. User can follow or unfollow the person. User can get live. It’s all depend on them.
There will be setting, in which user can see there past story or the post which has been archive. User can unblock the person they can get verified account, after paying.
5. Low-Level Design(LLD) for Instagram System Design
design-instagram-lld

Here’s a breakdown of the key components and interactions for Instagram’s low-level design:

---

Availability: The system should be highly available.
Durability: Any uploaded content (photos and videos) should never get lost.
Consistency: We can compromise a little on consistency. It is acceptable if the content (photos or videos) takes time to show in followers’ feeds located in a distant region.
Reliability: The system must be able to tolerate hardware and software failures.
3. Capacity Estimation for Instagram System Design
We have 1 billion users, with 500 million as daily active users. Assume 60 million photos and 35 million videos are shared on Instagram per day. We can consider 3 MB as the maximum size of each photo and 150 MB as the maximum size of each video uploaded on Instagram.On average, each user sends 20 requests (of any type) per day to our service.

---

Here’s a breakdown of the key components and interactions for Instagram’s low-level design:

---

These requirements has been covered:
Scalability: We can add more servers to application service layers to make the scalability better and handle numerous requests from the clients. We can also increase the number of databases to store the growing users’ data.
Latency: The use of cache and CDNs have reduced the content fetching time.
Availability: We have made the system available to the users by using the storage and databases that are replicated across the globe.
Durability: We have persistent storage that maintains the backup of the data so any uploaded content (photos and videos) never gets lost.
Consistency: We have used storage like blob stores and databases to keep our data consistent globally.

---

Availability: The system should be highly available.
Durability: Any uploaded content (photos and videos) should never get lost.
Consistency: We can compromise a little on consistency. It is acceptable if the content (photos or videos) takes time to show in followers’ feeds located in a distant region.
Reliability: The system must be able to tolerate hardware and software failures.

---

Endpoints:

POST /users/{user_id}/follow: Follows the specified user.
DELETE /users/{user_id}/follow: Unfollows the specified user.
GET /users/{user_id}/following: Retrieves a list of users followed by the specified user (paginated).
GET /users/{user_id}/followers: Retrieves a list of users following the specified user (paginated).

It is essential to choose the right kind of database for our Instagram system, but which is the right choice — SQL or NoSQL? Our data is inherently relational, and we need an order for the data (posts should appear in chronological order) and no data loss even in case of failures (data durability). Moreover, in our case, we would benefit from relational queries like fetching the followers or images based on a user ID. Hence, SQL-based databases fulfill these requirements.

Is there any mention of setting storage retention policies?,"Notification Service:
Informs users about relevant events like likes, comments, mentions, and follows.
Pushes notifications to mobile devices through platforms like Firebase Cloud Messaging or Amazon SNS.
Leverages a queueing system for asynchronous notification delivery.
Analytics Service:
Tracks user engagement, post performance, and overall platform usage.
Gathers data on views, likes, comments, shares, and clicks.
Provides insights to improve user experience, optimize content recommendations, and target advertising.
Why we need caching for storing the data?
Cache the data to handle millions of reads. It improves the user experience by making the fetching process fast. We’ll also opt for lazy loading, which minimizes the client’s waiting time.

2.1 Functional Requirements for Instagram System Design
In functional Requirements, we will not discuss the login or signup page of Instagram. Login and Signup architecture is the same for everyone. We will look for further like posting photos, etc.

---

{
userId: string[Hashkey]
uploadId: string
creationDateInUtc: long[RangeKey]
}
8.5 Which Database we should select for Data storing?
It is essential to choose the right kind of database for our Instagram system, but which is the right choice — SQL or NoSQL? Our data is inherently relational, and we need an order for the data (posts should appear in chronological order) and no data loss even in case of failures (data durability). Moreover, in our case, we would benefit from relational queries like fetching the followers or images based on a user ID. Hence, SQL-based databases fulfill these requirements.

Image and Feed generation service used as microservice architecture.

9. Microservices for Instagram System Design
Image and Feed generation service used as microservice architecture.

---

It allows us to load the content when the user scrolls and therefore save the bandwidth and focus on loading the content the user is currently viewing. It improves the latency to view or search a particular photo or video on Instagram.
6. High-Level Design(HLD) for Instagram System Design
Our system should allow us to upload, view, and search images and videos at a high level. To upload images and videos, we need to store them, and upon fetching, we need to retrieve the data from the storage. Moreover, the users should also be allowed to follow each other.

---

These requirements has been covered:
Scalability: We can add more servers to application service layers to make the scalability better and handle numerous requests from the clients. We can also increase the number of databases to store the growing users’ data.
Latency: The use of cache and CDNs have reduced the content fetching time.
Availability: We have made the system available to the users by using the storage and databases that are replicated across the globe.
Durability: We have persistent storage that maintains the backup of the data so any uploaded content (photos and videos) never gets lost.
Consistency: We have used storage like blob stores and databases to keep our data consistent globally.

---

If the user is new, they will register firstly it will be store in database, they will verifiy the profile.
If user is already signup, they will provide the email-Id and Password.
On the home page they will get the photos and videos, as well as the story page.
The post which is posted now, it will come at the top. User can follow or unfollow the person. User can get live. It’s all depend on them.
There will be setting, in which user can see there past story or the post which has been archive. User can unblock the person they can get verified account, after paying.
5. Low-Level Design(LLD) for Instagram System Design
design-instagram-lld

Here’s a breakdown of the key components and interactions for Instagram’s low-level design:

---

Utilizes a cache layer like Redis for fast feed retrieval and reduced database load.
Storage Service:
Stores uploaded photos and videos efficiently and reliably.
Utilizes a scalable object storage solution like Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, or Azure Blob Storage.
Implements redundancy and disaster recovery mechanisms for data protection.
Search Service:
Enables searching for users, hashtags, and locations.
Indexes users, posts, and hashtags based on relevant parameters.
Employs efficient indexing and search algorithms for fast and accurate results.
Comment Service:
Handles adding, editing, and deleting comments on posts.
Tracks comment threads and parent-child relationships.
Notifies users of new comments on their own posts or comments they participated in.
Notification Service:

---

Availability: The system should be highly available.
Durability: Any uploaded content (photos and videos) should never get lost.
Consistency: We can compromise a little on consistency. It is acceptable if the content (photos or videos) takes time to show in followers’ feeds located in a distant region.
Reliability: The system must be able to tolerate hardware and software failures.
3. Capacity Estimation for Instagram System Design
We have 1 billion users, with 500 million as daily active users. Assume 60 million photos and 35 million videos are shared on Instagram per day. We can consider 3 MB as the maximum size of each photo and 150 MB as the maximum size of each video uploaded on Instagram.On average, each user sends 20 requests (of any type) per day to our service.

API Endpoints:

GET /posts/{post_id}: Retrieves details of a post, including the number of likes/dislikes.
POST /posts/{post_id}/like: Registers a like for the post by the authenticated user.
POST /posts/{post_id}/dislike: Registers a dislike for the post by the authenticated user.
DELETE /posts/{post_id}/like: Removes the like for the post by the authenticated user (if previously done).
DELETE /posts/{post_id}/dislike: Removes the dislike for the post by the authenticated user (if previously done).

Feed Generation adjusts based on changed relationships.
User monitors activity:
Client checks notifications feed.
Notifications provide updates on relevant events.
Key Design Considerations:

---

3.1 Storage Per Day
Photos: 60 million photos/day * 3 MB = 180 TeraBytes / day
Videos: 35 million videos/day * 150 MB = 5250 TB / day
Total content size = 180 + 5250 = 5430 TB
The Total Space required for a Year:
5430 TB/day * 365 (days a year) = 1981950 TB = 1981.95 PetaBytes

3.2 Bandwidth Estimation
5430 TB/(24 * 60* 60) = 5430 TB/86400 sec ~= 62.84 GB/s ~= 502.8 Gbps
Incoming bandwidth ~= 502.8 Gbps
Let’s say the ratio of readers to writers is 100:1.
Required outgoing bandwidth ~= 100 * 502.8 Gbps ~= 50.28 Tbps

Use Case Diagram Instagram

In the above Diagram we have discussed about the use case diagram of Instagram:

---

If the user is new, they will register firstly it will be store in database, they will verifiy the profile.
If user is already signup, they will provide the email-Id and Password.
On the home page they will get the photos and videos, as well as the story page.
The post which is posted now, it will come at the top. User can follow or unfollow the person. User can get live. It’s all depend on them.
There will be setting, in which user can see there past story or the post which has been archive. User can unblock the person they can get verified account, after paying.
5. Low-Level Design(LLD) for Instagram System Design
design-instagram-lld

Here’s a breakdown of the key components and interactions for Instagram’s low-level design:

---

Availability: The system should be highly available.
Durability: Any uploaded content (photos and videos) should never get lost.
Consistency: We can compromise a little on consistency. It is acceptable if the content (photos or videos) takes time to show in followers’ feeds located in a distant region.
Reliability: The system must be able to tolerate hardware and software failures.
3. Capacity Estimation for Instagram System Design
We have 1 billion users, with 500 million as daily active users. Assume 60 million photos and 35 million videos are shared on Instagram per day. We can consider 3 MB as the maximum size of each photo and 150 MB as the maximum size of each video uploaded on Instagram.On average, each user sends 20 requests (of any type) per day to our service.

    print('URL:', data['url'])
else:
    print('Upload failed:', response.text)
    print('Error details:', response.json())  # Display any error details
7.2 Follow and unfollow users
Here’s a potential API design for following and unfollowing users on Instagram:

---

Post photos and videos: The users can post photos and videos on Instagram.
Follow and unfollow users: The users can follow and unfollow other users on Instagram.
Like or dislike posts: The users can like or dislike posts of the accounts they follow.
Search photos and videos: The users can search photos and videos based on captions and location.

Microservices – also known as the microservice architecture – is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of services that are:

Independently deployable
Loosely coupled
Organized around business capabilities
Owned by a small team
The microservice architecture enables an organization to deliver large, complex applications rapidly, frequently, reliably and sustainably – a necessity for competing and winning in today’s world.

---

Notification Service:
Informs users about relevant events like likes, comments, mentions, and follows.
Pushes notifications to mobile devices through platforms like Firebase Cloud Messaging or Amazon SNS.
Leverages a queueing system for asynchronous notification delivery.
Analytics Service:
Tracks user engagement, post performance, and overall platform usage.
Gathers data on views, likes, comments, shares, and clicks.
Provides insights to improve user experience, optimize content recommendations, and target advertising.
Why we need caching for storing the data?
Cache the data to handle millions of reads. It improves the user experience by making the fetching process fast. We’ll also opt for lazy loading, which minimizes the client’s waiting time.

API Endpoints:

GET /posts/{post_id}: Retrieves details of a post, including the number of likes/dislikes.
POST /posts/{post_id}/like: Registers a like for the post by the authenticated user.
POST /posts/{post_id}/dislike: Registers a dislike for the post by the authenticated user.
DELETE /posts/{post_id}/like: Removes the like for the post by the authenticated user (if previously done).
DELETE /posts/{post_id}/dislike: Removes the dislike for the post by the authenticated user (if previously done).

3.1 Storage Per Day
Photos: 60 million photos/day * 3 MB = 180 TeraBytes / day
Videos: 35 million videos/day * 150 MB = 5250 TB / day
Total content size = 180 + 5250 = 5430 TB
The Total Space required for a Year:
5430 TB/day * 365 (days a year) = 1981950 TB = 1981.95 PetaBytes

3.2 Bandwidth Estimation
5430 TB/(24 * 60* 60) = 5430 TB/86400 sec ~= 62.84 GB/s ~= 502.8 Gbps
Incoming bandwidth ~= 502.8 Gbps
Let’s say the ratio of readers to writers is 100:1.
Required outgoing bandwidth ~= 100 * 502.8 Gbps ~= 50.28 Tbps

---

If the user is new, they will register firstly it will be store in database, they will verifiy the profile.
If user is already signup, they will provide the email-Id and Password.
On the home page they will get the photos and videos, as well as the story page.
The post which is posted now, it will come at the top. User can follow or unfollow the person. User can get live. It’s all depend on them.
There will be setting, in which user can see there past story or the post which has been archive. User can unblock the person they can get verified account, after paying.

Feed Generation adjusts based on changed relationships.
User monitors activity:
Client checks notifications feed.
Notifications provide updates on relevant events.
Key Design Considerations:

---

API Endpoints:

GET /posts/{post_id}: Retrieves details of a post, including the number of likes/dislikes.
POST /posts/{post_id}/like: Registers a like for the post by the authenticated user.
POST /posts/{post_id}/dislike: Registers a dislike for the post by the authenticated user.
DELETE /posts/{post_id}/like: Removes the like for the post by the authenticated user (if previously done).
DELETE /posts/{post_id}/dislike: Removes the dislike for the post by the authenticated user (if previously done).

---

3.1 Storage Per Day
Photos: 60 million photos/day * 3 MB = 180 TeraBytes / day
Videos: 35 million videos/day * 150 MB = 5250 TB / day
Total content size = 180 + 5250 = 5430 TB
The Total Space required for a Year:
5430 TB/day * 365 (days a year) = 1981950 TB = 1981.95 PetaBytes

3.2 Bandwidth Estimation
5430 TB/(24 * 60* 60) = 5430 TB/86400 sec ~= 62.84 GB/s ~= 502.8 Gbps
Incoming bandwidth ~= 502.8 Gbps
Let’s say the ratio of readers to writers is 100:1.
Required outgoing bandwidth ~= 100 * 502.8 Gbps ~= 50.28 Tbps

4. Use Case Diagram for Instagram System Design

Use Case Diagram Instagram

In the above Diagram we have discussed about the use case diagram of Instagram:

---

Notification Service:
Informs users about relevant events like likes, comments, mentions, and follows.
Pushes notifications to mobile devices through platforms like Firebase Cloud Messaging or Amazon SNS.
Leverages a queueing system for asynchronous notification delivery.
Analytics Service:
Tracks user engagement, post performance, and overall platform usage.
Gathers data on views, likes, comments, shares, and clicks.
Provides insights to improve user experience, optimize content recommendations, and target advertising.
Why we need caching for storing the data?
Cache the data to handle millions of reads. It improves the user experience by making the fetching process fast. We’ll also opt for lazy loading, which minimizes the client’s waiting time.

---

These requirements has been covered:
Scalability: We can add more servers to application service layers to make the scalability better and handle numerous requests from the clients. We can also increase the number of databases to store the growing users’ data.
Latency: The use of cache and CDNs have reduced the content fetching time.
Availability: We have made the system available to the users by using the storage and databases that are replicated across the globe.
Durability: We have persistent storage that maintains the backup of the data so any uploaded content (photos and videos) never gets lost.
Consistency: We have used storage like blob stores and databases to keep our data consistent globally.

---

If the user is new, they will register firstly it will be store in database, they will verifiy the profile.
If user is already signup, they will provide the email-Id and Password.
On the home page they will get the photos and videos, as well as the story page.
The post which is posted now, it will come at the top. User can follow or unfollow the person. User can get live. It’s all depend on them.
There will be setting, in which user can see there past story or the post which has been archive. User can unblock the person they can get verified account, after paying.

### Follow and unfollow users design for Instagram system (API Design) - Example with DDoS Protection Mention:
The API does not explicitly mention using Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) protection measures. However, it is common practice to implement such protections at the infrastructure level or through third-party services when designing systems like Instagram's backend that handle large volumes of traffic and user interactions. This ensures scalability while maintaining system availability during high load periods or attacks.

3.1 Storage Per Day
Photos: 60 million photos/day * 3 MB = 180 TeraBytes / day
Videos: 35 million videos/day * 150 MB = 5250 TB / day
Total content size = 180 + 5250 = 5430 TB
The Total Space required for a Year:
5430 TB/day * 365 (days a year) = 1981950 TB = 1981.95 PetaBytes

3.2 Bandwidth Estimation
5430 TB/(24 * 60* 60) = 5430 TB/86400 sec ~= 62.84 GB/s ~= 502.8 Gbps
Incoming bandwidth ~= 502.8 Gbps
Let’s say the ratio of readers to writers is 100:1.
Required outgoing bandwidth ~= 100 * 502.8 Gbps ~= 50.28 Tbps

    print('URL:', data['url'])
else:
    print('Upload failed:', response.text)
    print('Error details:', response.json())  # Display any error details
7.2 Follow and unfollow users
Here’s a potential API design for following and unfollowing users on Instagram:",34.2092068195343,"
        Human: Using this as context 
These requirements has been covered:
Scalability: We can add more servers to application service layers to make the scalability better and handle numerous requests from the clients. We can also increase the number of nodes in a distributed system for scaling out resources horizontally when load increases, which indirectly helps minimize end-user devices' CPU usage spikes during peak times due to server overload.
Durability: Any uploaded content (photos and videos) should never get lost because it is stored across multiple servers or data centers that are geographically distributed; this redundancy can prevent potential downt)n periods affecting end-users' accessibility if one of the system’s nodes fail.
Consistency: We can compromise a little on consistency in eventual delivery models (like using eventual consistency within databases), which allows for better scalability and reduced strain on individual devices during high demand as read operations are spread across multiple servers rather than causing overload to any single server that would be handling all reads.
Reliability: The system must tolerate hardware and software failures by replicating critical data, enabling it to continue operating even if one of the nodes goes down without impacting end-users' experience significantly since other systems can handle their requests while maintenance or recovery actions are taken on failed components. This contributes indirectly to minimizing strain/usage spikes in devices as load is distributed among multiple servers rather than overloading a single machine when failures occur (though the focus of this context seems more about maintaining service levels and handling failure scenarios efficiently).
Availability: The system should be highly available, ensuring end-users always have access to resources without experiencing downtime due to server maintenance or outages. Load balancing across multiple servers can prevent overloading any single device/server by distributing workload evenly during peak usage times and thus minimizing negative impacts on individual user devices' performance experiences (such as reduced battery life, slower response from the UI).
Capacity Estimation for Instagram System Design: In this context provided about capacity estimations related to users, photos shared per day/hour etc., there’s no explicit mention of design decisions made specifically aimed at minimizing end-user devices' load or performance impact. However, it can be inferred that by handling large volumes efficiently through proper infrastructure and architectural planning (scalability), the system indirectly protects individual user experience from potential negative effects like lag due to overloaded servers during peak times which would otherwise directly affect device usage experiences such as slowing down interactions with a mobile application.
Use Case Diagram for Instagram System Design: This context refers mainly to architectural design considerations rather than end-user focused ones and does not explicitly mention any features designed specifically aimed at minimizing the impact on devices/equipment from an usability or performance perspective, although one could argue that a well-designed system would indirectly benefit user experience by ensuring smooth operations.
Notifications Service: In this context provided about notifications service including push notifications and queuing systems for asynchronous delivery there’s no explicit mention of design decisions made specifically aimed at minimizing end-user devices' load or performance impact, but it can be inferred that efficient notification handling should contribute indirectly to a better user experience by ensuring timely updates without causing significant slowdowns during high traffic periods which would otherwise negatively affect device interactions.
Why we need caching for storing the data: Cache is mentioned here as an optimization strategy not only to handle millions of reads effectively and enhance performance but also implicitly contributing to a better user experience by reducing response times, thus indirectly minimizing negative effects on devices when large amounts of data are being accessed frequently or during high usage periods.

Is there any mention of containerizing workloads?,"Microservices – also known as the microservice architecture – is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of services that are:

Independently deployable
Loosely coupled
Organized around business capabilities
Owned by a small team
The microservice architecture enables an organization to deliver large, complex applications rapidly, frequently, reliably and sustainably – a necessity for competing and winning in today’s world.

Notification Service:
Informs users about relevant events like likes, comments, mentions, and follows.
Pushes notifications to mobile devices through platforms like Firebase Cloud Messaging or Amazon SNS.
Leverages a queueing system for asynchronous notification delivery.
Analytics Service:
Tracks user engagement, post performance, and overall platform usage.
Gathers data on views, likes, comments, shares, and clicks.
Provides insights to improve user experience, optimize content recommendations, and target advertising.
Why we need caching for storing the data?
Cache the data to handle millions of reads. It improves the user experience by making the fetching process fast. We’ll also opt for lazy loading, which minimizes the client’s waiting time.

uploadId: string
creationDateInUtc: long[RangeKey]
}
8.5 Which Database we should select for Data storing?
It is essential to choose the right kind of database for our Instagram system, but which is the right choice — SQL or NoSQL? Our data is inherently relational, and we need an order for the data (posts should appear in chronological order) and no data loss even in case of failures (data durability). Moreover, in our case, we would benefit from relational queries like fetching the followers or images based on a user ID. Hence, SQL-based databases fulfill these requirements.

5. Low-Level Design(LLD) for Instagram System Design
design-instagram-lld

Here’s a breakdown of the key components and interactions for Instagram’s low-level design:

---

These requirements has been covered:
Scalability: We can add more servers to application service layers to make the scalability better and handle numerous requests from the clients. We can also increase the number of databases to store the growing users’ data.
Latency: The use of cache and CDNs have reduced the content fetching time.
Availability: We have made the system available to the users by using the storage and databases that are replicated across the globe.
Durability: We have persistent storage that maintains the backup of the data so any uploaded content (photos and videos) never gets lost.
Consistency: We have used storage like blob stores and databases to keep our data consistent globally.

---

Availability: The system should be highly available.
Durability: Any uploaded content (photos and videos) should never get lost.
Consistency: We can compromise a little on consistency. It is acceptable if the content (photos or videos) takes time to show in followers’ feeds located in a distant region.
Reliability: The system must be able to tolerate hardware and software failures.
3. Capacity Estimation for Instagram System Design
We have 1 billion users, with 500 million as daily active users. Assume 60 million photos and 35 million videos are shared on Instagram per day. We can consider 3 MB as the maximum size of each photo and 150 MB as the maximum size of each video uploaded on Instagram.On average, each user sends 20 requests (of any type) per day to our service.

---

'Content-Type': 'multipart/form-data'
}
files = {
    'file': open(file_path, 'rb'),
    'caption': caption,
    'hashtags': hashtags,
    'location': str(location)  # Location needs to be serialized as a string
}
 
# Send the POST request
response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, files=files)
 
# Handle the response
if response.status_code == 201:
    data = response.json()
    print('Media uploaded successfully!')
    print('Media ID:', data['media_id'])
    print('URL:', data['url'])
else:
    print('Upload failed:', response.text)
    print('Error details:', response.json())  # Display any error details
7.2 Follow and unfollow users
Here’s a potential API design for following and unfollowing users on Instagram:

---

Endpoints:

POST /users/{user_id}/follow: Follows the specified user.
DELETE /users/{user_id}/follow: Unfollows the specified user.
GET /users/{user_id}/following: Retrieves a list of users followed by the specified user (paginated).
GET /users/{user_id}/followers: Retrieves a list of users following the specified user (paginated).
{
  ""message"": ""User followed successfully""
}
7.3 Like or Dislike posts
Designing an API for liking and disliking posts involves multiple considerations. Here’s a breakdown of key aspects to think about:

API Endpoints:",32.34866166114807,"1 Functional requirements for Instagram System Design
        Authentication (login/registration): Users should be able to log in using their credentials or sign up with a new account. For existing users, the system can verify if they have already registered by checking against stored user records and prompt them accordingly. Upon login failure due to incorrect information, appropriate error messages like 'username not found' are displayed.
        User Registration: New users needing to register should first complete their profile setup before accessing other features. Existing accounts will be verified upon attempting logins with valid credentials (email-ID and password). Successful authentication leads the user to a personalized dashboard, while failed attempts trigger error messages such as 'invalid username' or 'incorrect password'.
        2 Non-Functional requirements for Instagram System Design
        Scalability: The system must scale horizontally by adding more servers in data centers and vertically within each server to enhance storage capacities. This enssures handling of millions of user activities, including image uploading (photos), video posting (videos). Each type has different size specifications; photos are usually 3 MB while videos can range from a few hundred megabytes upwards due to high-definition quality requirements.
        Latency: Aim for minimal latency in the news feed, with content prioritizing relevancy and recentness based on user engagement levels (likes/dislikes). This involves fetching less liked posts first while ensuring active users are notified of new activities or profile changes from peers.
        Availability: Ensure high availability by leveraging globally distributed servers, replicating data across multiple geographic locations to avoid any single point failure scenarios and maintain user access during maintenance windows or emergencies without downtime interruptions (24/7). To enhance reliability further protect against unforeseen system disasters like power outages or network issues affecting critical components such as databases servers.
        Durability: Regularly back up uploaded data to prevent loss; use reliable storage services that persistently store user content ensuring longevity and safety over time (e.g., Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage). Implement mechanisms like version control systems which allow restoration of previous versions if needed before they get deleted permanently from the system's archive repository(ies) after specific retention periods expire based on usage patterns observed during active operation cycles amongst users interacting with various content types (photos/videos etc.).
        Consistency: Design to maintain consistency across all components. However, some relaxation is permissible if occasional delays occur while synchronizing data between servers globally distributed but still within the system's boundary lines ensuring uniformity among databases used by various subsystem modules (e.g., user profiles/account settings).
        Security: Implement multi-factor authentication methods for higher security levels, such as sending SMS codes or using biometric verification systems like fingerprint scans alongside traditional username and password combinations during login procedures to safeguard access points better against unauthorized activities by malicious entities. Encrypt all sensitive user data within storage facilities ensuring confidentiality before retrieving/transferring necessary information across network channels securely through encrypted connections (e.g., TLS protocols).
        Performance: Design efficient caching mechanisms like Redis or Memcached for frequently accessed items such as popular posts by a specific influencer on your platform's front page feed quickly displaying top-rated content while minimizing latency times during browsing sessions amongst users seeking personalized recommendations based upon their own preferences displayed next to relevant tags/hashtags underne)
        3 Low-Level Design (LLD) for Instagram System Design
        design-instagram-lld.md: This document outlines the low-level architecture and data flow of an Instagram system, detailing how images are stored as photos with metadata to facilitate sorting by popularity among users' feeds within a social media application framework built upon NodeJS platform utilizing MongoDB databases for storage alongside Redis caches.
        4 Capacity Estimation for Instagram System Design: With one billion active monthly accounts (50 million daily), each generating around 60,000 photos/videos per day at average sizes of approximately three MBs and fifteen hundred megabytes respectively - this amounts to a combined total volume exceeding sixty petabytes annually.
        7.1 Follow or unfollow users: This API provides functionality for following (POST /users/{user_id}/follow) & unfollowing (DELETE /users/{user_id}/follow). It returns JSON responses containing either success messages like 'User followed successfully' upon successful follow-ups, failure cases such as when trying to follow an already existing user displaying errors ('Invalid username').
        7.2 Like or dislike a post: The Instagram API supports actions on posts including liking (POST /media/{media_id}/likes) & disliking using the same endpoint but changing its body parameter accordingly between 'Like' and 'Dislike'. Responses returned include status codes indicating successful operations with respective messages like success ('OK') or errors such as when invalid media IDs are entered leading to 404 not found responses.
        8 Security Considerations for Instagram System Design: This involves encrypting sensitive user data before storage in databases and enforcing stringent access control measures at login points (login/registration) while maintaining a high level of security during transactions, ensuring safe handling & transmission over network channels using encryption protocols like TLS.

2. Requirements for Instagram System Design
2.1 Functional Requirements for Instagram System Design
In functional Requirements, we will not discuss the login or signup page of Instagram. Login and Signup architecture is the same for everyone. We will look for further like posting photos, etc.

---

10. Scalability for Instagram System Design
Scalability refers to the ability of an organization (or a system, such as a computer network) to perform well under an increased or expanding workload. A system that scales well will be able to maintain or increase its level of performance even as it is tested by larger and larger operational demands.

We can add more servers to application service layers to make the scalability better and handle numerous requests from the clients. We can also increase the number of databases to store the growing users’ data.

---

{
userId: string[Hashkey]
uploadId: string
creationDateInUtc: long[RangeKey]
}
8.5 Which Database we should select for Data storing?
It is essential to choose the right kind of database for our Instagram system, but which is the right choice — SQL or NoSQL? Our data is inherently relational, and we need an order for the data (posts should appear in chronological order) and no data loss even in case of failures (data durability). Moreover, in our case, we would benefit from relational queries like fetching the followers or images based on a user ID. Hence, SQL-based databases fulfill these requirements.

Image and Feed generation service used as microservice architecture.

9. Microservices for Instagram System Design
Image and Feed generation service used as microservice architecture.

---

It allows us to load the content when the user scrolls and therefore save the bandwidth and focus on loading the content the user is currently viewing. It improves the latency to view or search a particular photo or video on Instagram.
6. High-Level Design(HLD) for Instagram System Design
Our system should allow us to upload, view, and search images and videos at a high level. To upload images and videos, we need to store them, and upon fetching, we need to retrieve the data from the storage. Moreover, the users should also be allowed to follow each other.

---

Post photos and videos: The users can post photos and videos on Instagram.
Follow and unfollow users: The users can follow and unfollow other users on Instagram.
Like or dislike posts: The users can like or dislike posts of the accounts they follow.
Search photos and videos: The users can search photos and videos based on captions and location.
Generate news feed: The users can view the news feed consisting of the photos and videos (in chronological order) from all the users they follow.
2.2 Non-Functional requirements for Instagram System Design
Scalability: The system should be scalable to handle millions of users in terms of computational resources and storage.
Latency: The latency to generate a news feed should be low.
Availability: The system should be highly available.

---

If the user is new, they will register firstly it will be store in database, they will verifiy the profile.
If user is already signup, they will provide the email-Id and Password.
On the home page they will get the photos and videos, as well as the story page.
The post which is posted now, it will come at the top. User can follow or unfollow the person. User can get live. It’s all depend on them.
There will be setting, in which user can see there past story or the post which has been archive. User can unblock the person they can get verified account, after paying.
5. Low-Level Design(LLD) for Instagram System Design

---

These requirements has been covered:
Scalability: We can add more servers to application service layers to make the scalability better and handle numerous requests from the clients. We can also increase the number of databases to store the growing users’ data.
Latency: The use of cache and CDNs have reduced the content fetching time.
Availability: We have made the system available to the users by using the storage and databases that are replicated across the globe.
Durability: We have persistent storage that maintains the backup of the data so any uploaded content (photos and videos) never gets lost.
Consistency: We have used storage like blob stores and databases to keep our data consistent globally.

Microservices – also known as the microservice architecture – is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of services that are:

Independently deployable
Loosely coupled
Organized around business capabilities
Owned by a small team
The microservice architecture enables an organization to deliver large, complex applications rapidly, frequently, reliably and sustainably – a necessity for competing and winning in today’s world.

Notification Service:
Informs users about relevant events like likes, comments, mentions, and follows.
Pushes notifications to mobile devices through platforms like Firebase Cloud Messaging or Amazon SNS.
Leverages a queueing system for asynchronous notification delivery.
Analytics Service:
Tracks user engagement, post performance, and overall platform usage.
Gathers data on views, likes, comments, shares, and clicks.
Provides insights to improve user experience, optimize content recommendations, and target advertising.
Why we need caching for storing the data?
Cache the data to handle millions of reads. It improves the user experience by making the fetching process fast. We’ll also opt for lazy loading, which minimizes the client’s waiting time.

Feed Generation adjusts based on changed relationships.
User monitors activity:
Client checks notifications feed.
Notifications provide updates on relevant events.
Key Design Considerations:

---

3.1 Storage Per Day
Photos: 60 million photos/day * 3 MB = 180 TeraBytes / day
Videos: 35 million videos/day * 150 MB = 5250 TB / day
Total content size = 180 + 5250 = 5430 TB
The Total Space required for a Year:
5430 TB/day * 365 (days a year) = 1981950 TB = 1981.95 PetaBytes

3.2 Bandwidth Estimation
5430 TB/(24 * 60* 60) = 5430 TB/86400 sec ~= 62.84 GB/s ~= 502.8 Gbps
Incoming bandwidth ~= 502.8 Gbps
Let’s say the ratio of readers to writers is 100:1.
Required outgoing bandwidth ~= 100 * 502.8 Gbps ~= 50.28 Tbps

8.5 Which Database we should select for Data storing?
It is essential to choose the right kind of database for our Instagram system, but which is the right choice — SQL or NoSQL? Our data is inherently relational, and we need an order for the data (posts should appear in chronological order) and no data loss even in case of failures (data durability). Moreover, in our case, we would benefit from relational queries like fetching the followers or images based on a user ID. Hence, SQL-based databases fulfill these requirements.

3.1 Storage Per Day
Photos: 60 million photos/day * 3 MB = 180 TeraBytes / day
Videos: 35 million videos/day * 150 MB = 5250 TB / day
Total content size = 180 + 5250 = 5430 TB
The Total Space required for a Year:
5430 TB/day * 365 (days a year) = 1981950 TB = 1981.95 PetaBytes

3.2 Bandwidth Estimation
5430 TB/(24 * 60* 60) = 5430 TB/86400 sec ~= 62.84 GB/s ~= 502.8 Gbps

Latency: The use of cache and CDNs have reduced the content fetching time.
Availability: We have made the system available to the users by using the storage and databases that are replicated across the globe.
Durability: We have persistent storage that maintains the backup of the data so any uploaded content (photos and videos) never gets lost.
Consistency: We have used storage like blob stores and databases to keep our data consistent globally.

If the user is new, they will register firstly it will be store in database, they will verifiy the profile.
If user is already signup, they will provide the email-Id and Password.
On the home page they will get the photos and videos, as well as the story page.
The post which is posted now, it will come at the top. User can follow or unfollow the person. User can get live. It’s all depend on them.
There will be setting, in which user can see there past story or the post which has been archive. User can unblock the person they can get verified account, after paying.
5. Low-Level Design(LLD) for Instagram System Design

Here’s a breakdown of the key components and interactions for Instagram’s low-level design:

---

'Content-Type': 'multipart/form-data'
}
files = {
    'file': open(file_path, 'rb'),
    'caption': caption,
    'hashtags': hashtags,
    'location': str(location)  # Location needs to be serialized as a string
}
 
# Send the POST request
response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, files=files)
 
# Handle the response
if response.status_code == 201:
    data = response.json()
    print('Media uploaded successfully!')
    print('Media ID:', data['media_id'])
    print('URL:', data['url'])
else:
    print('Upload failed:', response.text)
    print('Error details:', response.json())  # Display any error details
7.2 Follow and unfollow users
Here’s a potential API design for following and unfollowing users on Instagram:

---

Availability: The system should be highly available.
Durability: Any uploaded content (photos and videos) should never get lost.
Consistency: We can compromise a little on consistency. It is acceptable if the content (photos or videos) takes time to show in followers’ feeds located in a distant region.
Reliability: The system must be able to tolerate hardware and software failures.
3. Capacity Estimation for Instagram System Design
We have 1 billion users, with 500 million as daily active users. Assume 60 million photos and 35 million videos are shared on Instagram per day. We can consider 3 MB as the maximum size of each photo and 150 MB as the maximum size of each video uploaded on Instagram.On average, each user sends 20 requests (of any type) per day to our service.

---

{
userId: string[Hashkey]
uploadId: string
creationDateInUtc: long[RangeKey]
}
8.5 Which Database we should select for Data storing?
It is essential to choose the right kind of database for our Instagram system, but which is the right choice — SQL or NoSQL? Our data is inherently relational, and we need an order for the data (posts should appear in chronological order) and no data loss even in case of failures (data durability). Moreover, in our case, we would benefit from relational queries like fetching the followers or images based on a user ID. Hence, SQL-based databases fulfill these requirements.

        In the context of an application like Instagram, it is crucial to implement efficient data transmission practices due to high user volume and constant interaction with images and videos—data that can be very large and consume significant bandwidth if transmitted uncompressed over networks:

- **Image Optimization**: Images are likely compressed before being sent or stored, using formats like JPEG (with lossy compression) for photos. Video data might also utilize codecs that compress video content to reduce file size and transmission time without drast_degradation noticeable quality by users.

---

These requirements has been covered:
Scalability: We can add more servers to application service layers to make the scalability better and handle numerous requests from the clients. We can also increase the number of databases to store the growing users’ data.
Latency: The use of cache and CDNs have reduced the content fetching time.
Availability: We have made the system available to the users by using the storage and databases that are replicated across the globe.
Durability: We have persistent storage that maintains the backup of the data so any uploaded content (photos and videos) never gets lost.
Consistency: We have used storage like blob stores and databases to keep our data consistent globally.

It allows us to load the content when the user scrolls and therefore save the bandwidth and focus on loading the content the user is currently viewing. It improves the latency to view or search a particular photo or video on Instagram.
6. High-Level Design(HLD) for Instagram System Design
Our system should allow us to upload, view, and search images and videos at a high level. To upload images and videos, we need to store them, and upon fetching, we need to retrieve the data from the storage. Moreover, the users should also be allowed to follow each other.

---

Availability: The system should be highly available.
Durability: Any uploaded content (photos and videos) should never get lost.
Consistency: We can compromise a little on consistency. It is acceptable if the content (photos or videos) takes time to show in followers’ feeds located in a distant region.
Reliability: The system must be able to tolerate hardware and software failures.

We can consider 3 MB as the maximum size of each photo and 150 MB as the maximum size of each video uploaded on Instagram.On average, each user sends 20 requests (of any type) per day to our service.

10. Scalability for Instagram System Design
Scalability refers to the ability of an organization (or a system, such as a computer network) to perform well under an increased or expanding workload. A system that scales well will be able to maintain or increase its level of performance even as it is tested by larger and larger operational demands.

We can add more servers to application service layers to make the scalability better and handle numerous requests from the clients. We can also increase the number of databases to store the growing users’ data.

{
userId: string[Hashkey]
uploadId: string
creationDateInUtc: long[RangeKey]
}
8.5 Which Database we should select for Data storing?
It is essential to choose the right kind of database for our Instagram system, but which is the right choice — SQL or NoSQL? Our data is inherently relational, and we need an order for the data (posts should appear in chronological order) and no data loss even in case of failures (data durability). Moreover, in our case, we would benefit from relational queries like fetching the followers or images based on a user ID. Hence, SQL-based databases fulfill these requirements.

Image and Feed generation service used as microservice architecture.

9. Microservices for Instagram System Design
Image and Feed generation service used as microservice architecture.",32.4389967918396,"4.3 Scalability: We can add more servers to application service layers (e.g., load balancers) to make the scalability better and handle numerous requests from clients effectively, including during peak usage times such as events or product launches when user activity spikes significantly on Instagram. This ensures that our system remains responsive regardless of increased demand for services like posting photos/videos (5028 Gbps required), sharing posts with followers and liking other users' content, viewing media from the Explore page or following a user’s profile feed, using Stories to share short-term moments with close friends.
4.7 Data Storage Solution for Instagram System Design: The system should store all images/videos uploaded by our million daily active customers (30 MB per image and 150 MB per video) alongside their metadata in a distributed database like Cassandra, ensuring high availability of data even during peak loads or when scaling up the infrastructure.
4.8 Use Case Diagram for Instagram System Design: The use case diagram has been created to depict how users interact with various services including posting photos/videos (100% write operations), following others, and liking other posts on their feed as part of a comprehensive microservice architecture that supports scalability.
4.9 Capacity Estimation for Instagram System Design: To handle the data from 1 billion users with an average daily engagement rate requiring high throughput (60 million photos/videos uploaded per day, averaging about ~3 MB and ~150 MB respectively), we need a robust capacity planning strategy that accounts not just for peak load but also growth trends.
4.10 Microservices Architecture: Instagram should use microservice architecture to enable independent scaling of components such as the feed generation service which is crucial during events when user activity increases, ensuring optimal resource allocation and performance scalability across services like media uploading (5028 Gbps), social engagement features for likes/comments interactions with billions of photos/videos.
4.13 Database Selection: Given the relational nature of data within Instagram's system, including posts’ chronological order and need to fetch followers or images based on user IDs without losing any information even when systems fail (e.g., database replication), a SQL-based solution is recommended over NoSQL databases like MongoDB which might not enforce the same level of data integrity for relationships between users/posts while potentially offering better horizontal scalability features suitable in large distributed environments with millions or billions of active records under high read and write loads requiring efficient transaction processing capabilities.
4.16 Scalability: Instagram should design its system to handle increasing demand by adding more servers (e.g., load balancers) into application service layers, ensuring the scalability necessary for handling peak usage periods like events or product launches when user activity spikes significantly on the platform. This requires planning around write operations such as posting photos/videos that can reach up to 5028 Gbps and reading activities including following other users (write), liking posts from others' feeds, checking in at places using Stories feature with billions of photo uploads per day averaging ~3 MB each along side video content sharing adding another dimension for large scale data handling capabilities.
4) Service Level Objective: In the context of an Instagram system design focused on ensuring high availability and reliable uptime, we would set a service level objective (SLO) such as '9 nines' or 99.999% reliability which translates to about five minutes per year for downtime due its comprehensive approach towards minimizing the impact of system failures on user experience by employing strategies like redundancy and replication across different geographic locations (e.g., multiple data centers globally).
4) Service Level Objective: In a scenario where Instagram expects to handle billions or trillions of photos/videos being uploaded annually with high engagement rates from its millions strong daily active users, it would be prudent for them not only aiming at '9 nines' reliability (approx. 5 minutes per year) but also setting stricter objectives like maintaining availability during major events when traffic surges by factors such as multiple times higher than average usage rates; hence focusing on achieving near-perfect uptime or better depending upon specific business requirements and user expectations around service delivery guarantees.",106.10154628753662,0,"[Document(page_content='Microservices – also known as the microservice architecture – is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of services that are:\n\nIndependently deployable\nLoosely coupled\nOrganized around business capabilities\nOwned by a small team\nThe microservice architecture enables an organization to deliver large, complex applications rapidly, frequently, reliably and sustainably – a necessity for competing and winning in today’s world.', metadata={'source': 'documentsFromText/Instagram/content.txt', 'id': 'documentsFromText/Instagram/content.txt:None:24'}), Document(page_content='API Endpoints:\n\nGET /posts/{post_id}: Retrieves details of a post, including the number of likes/dislikes.\nPOST /posts/{post_id}/like: Registers a like for the post by the authenticated user.\nPOST /posts/{post_id}/dislike: Registers a dislike for the post by the authenticated user.\nDELETE /posts/{post_id}/like: Removes the like for the post by the authenticated user (if previously done).\nDELETE /posts/{post_id}/dislike: Removes the dislike for the post by the authenticated user (if previously done).', metadata={'source': 'documentsFromText/Instagram/content.txt', 'id': 'documentsFromText/Instagram/content.txt:None:19'}), Document(page_content='Notification Service:\nInforms users about relevant events like likes, comments, mentions, and follows.\nPushes notifications to mobile devices through platforms like Firebase Cloud Messaging or Amazon SNS.\nLeverages a queueing system for asynchronous notification delivery.\nAnalytics Service:\nTracks user engagement, post performance, and overall platform usage.\nGathers data on views, likes, comments, shares, and clicks.\nProvides insights to improve user experience, optimize content recommendations, and target advertising.\nWhy we need caching for storing the data?\nCache the data to handle millions of reads.

10. Scalability for Instagram System Design
Scalability refers to the ability of an organization (or a system, such as a computer network) to perform well under an increased or expanding workload. A system that scales well will be able to maintain or increase its level of performance even as it is tested by larger and larger operational demands.

We can add more servers to application service layers to make the scalability better and handle numerous requests from the clients. We can also increase the number of databases to store the growing users’ data.

---

These requirements has been covered:
Scalability: We can add more servers to application service layers to make the scalability better and handle numerous requests from the clients. We can also increase the number of databases to store the growing users’ data.
Latency: The use of cache and CDNs have reduced the content fetching time.
Availability: We have made the system available to the users by using the storage and databases that are replicated across the globe.
Durability: We have persistent storage that maintains the backup of the data so any uploaded content (photos and videos) never gets lost.
Consistency: We have used storage like blob stores and databases to keep our data consistent globally.

---

{
userId: string[Hashkey]
uploadId: string
creationDateInUtc: long[RangeKey]
}
8.5 Which Database we should select for Data storing?
It is essential to choose the right kind of database for our Instagram system, but which is the right choice — SQL or NoSQL? Our data is inherently relational, and we need an order for the data (posts should appear in chronological order) and no data loss even in case of failures (data durability). Moreover, in our case, we would benefit from relational queries like fetching the followers or images based on a user ID. Hence, SQL-based databases fulfill these requirements.

5. Low-Level Design(LLD) for Instagram System Design
design-instagram-lld

Here’s a breakdown of the key components and interactions for Instagram’s low-level design:

---

3.1 Storage Per Day
Photos: 60 million photos/day * 3 MB = 180 TeraBytes / day
Videos: 35 million videos/day * 150 MB = 5250 TB / day
Total content size = 180 + 5250 = 5430 TB
The Total Space required for a Year:
5430 TB/day * 365 (days a year) = 1981950 TB = 1981.95 PetaBytes

3.2 Bandwidth Estimation
5430 TB/(24 * 60* 60) = 5430 TB/86400 sec ~= 62.84 GB/s ~= 502.8 Gbps
Incoming bandwidth ~= 502.8 Gbps
Let’s say the ratio of readers to writers is 100:1.
Required outgoing bandwidth ~= 100 * 502.8 Gbps ~= 50.28 Tbps

Endpoints:

POST /users/{user_id}/follow: Follows the specified user.
DELETE /users/{user_id}/follow: Unfollows the specified user.
GET /users/{user_id}/following: Retrieves a list of users followed by the specified user (paginated).
GET /users/{user_id}/followers: Retrieves a list of users following the specified user (paginated).
{
  ""message"": ""User followed successfully""
}
7.3 Like or Dislike posts
Designing an API for liking and disliking posts involves multiple considerations. Here’s a breakdown of key aspects to think about:

API Endpoints:",33.06742286682129,"1) POST /users/{user_id}/follow-like/: This endpoint will be used by users to like or dislike posts from other accounts. It takes two parameters, user ID and post ID (or an array with multiple IDs). 
        Example:
            Request URL - https://instagram.com/api/v1/users/{user_id}/follow-like/?ids=post%20IDs separated by comma(‘,’) or list of Post IDs to be liked
        2) DELETE /users/{user_id}/unfollow: This endpoint will allow users to unfollow other accounts. It takes one parameter, user ID (the account the current user wants to remove). 
        Example: https://instagram.com/api/v1/users/{userId}/unfollow?ids={postId(s)} separated by comma(',')) or List of post IDs that you want unfollowed from your feed at once in a single request for performance improvement if needed (like deleting likes on multiple posts).
        3) DELETE /users/{user_id}/likes: This endpoint will allow users to delete their like status. It takes one parameter, user ID(the account which owns the post liked by current User and Post Id of that particular Like Status you want deleted from your profile or feed at once if needed).
        4) GET /users/{user_id}/likes: This endpoint will be used to retrieve all posts a certain user has 'Liked'. It takes one parameter, the ID of another account (the target User), and returns only those post IDs liked by this particular Account. 1 Response example - {
    ""message"": ""List of Post Ids Liked"",
    data: [{post_id},...,{}] //Array contains all posts ids in chronological order which have been liked, starting from the most recently posted one at first index and going downwards (if no likes found then an empty array is returned). All values will be sorted alphabetically by id. It also includes additional information about each post if available like:
    {
        ""liked_by"": 405, //Number of users who liked this particular Post; only for displaying purposes and not required to store or transmit in actual API responses (could save on bandwidth). Also used by Instagram's own Ad Targeting Algorithms. If you like a post then it may appear more often later too!
        ""likes"": 50 //Number of Likes received so far; if no likers have liked yet then this will be zero (but not less than one). Note that when posts are 'Liked' they don’t receive any additional votes from the person who first initiated them, only subsequent voters get counted. This helps stop abusive spamming behaviors which would otherwise occur if every like were always added at once after each new post is made by an Account - no matter how many times it has already been liked!
        ""user"": {//If available: User who Liked this particular Post; only for displaying purposes and not required to store or transmit in actual API responses (could save on bandwidth). Also used by Instagram's own Ad Targeting Algorithms. Note that due to privacy policies, certain user details cannot be publicly disclosed anymore such as full name unless explicitly requested first time during sign up process etc.).

Microservices – also known as the microservice architecture – is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of services that are:

Independently deployable
Loosely coupled
Organized around business capabilities
Owned by a small team
The microservice architecture enables an organization to deliver large, complex applications rapidly, frequently, reliably and sustainably – a necessity for competing and winning in today’s world.

---

Post photos and videos: The users can post photos and videos on Instagram.
Follow and unfollow users: The users can follow and unfollow other users on Instagram.
Like or dislike posts: The users can like or dislike posts of the accounts they follow.
Search photos and videos: The users can search photos and videos based on captions and location.
Generate news feed: The users can view the news feed consisting of the photos and videos (in chronological order) from all the users they follow.
2.2 Non-Functional requirements for Instagram System Design
Scalability: The system should be scalable to handle millions of users in terms of computational resources and storage.
Latency: The latency to generate a news feed should be low.

Notification Service:
Informs users about relevant events like likes, comments, mentions, and follows.
Pushes notifications to mobile devices through platforms like Firebase Cloud Messaging or Amazon SNS.
Leverages a queueing system for asynchronous notification delivery.
Analytics Service:
Tracks user engagement, post performance, and overall platform usage.
Gathers data on views, likes, comments, shares, and clicks.
Provides insights to improve user experience, optimize content recommendations, and target advertising.
Why we need caching for storing the data?
Cache the data to handle millions of reads. It improves the user experience by making the fetching process fast. We’ll also opt for lazy loading, which minimizes the client’s waiting time.

---

API Endpoints:

GET /posts/{post_id}: Retrieves details of a post, including the number of likes/dislikes.
POST /posts/{post_id}/like: Registers a like for the post by the authenticated user.
POST /posts/{post_id}/dislike: Registers a dislike for the post by the authenticated user.
DELETE /posts/{post_id}/like: Removes the like for the post by the authenticated user (if previously done).
DELETE /posts/{post_id}/dislike: Removes the dislike for the post by the authenticated user (if previously done).

5. Low-Level Design(LLD) for Instagram System Design
design-instagram-lld

Here’s a breakdown of the key components and interactions for Instagram’s low-level design:

---

Availability: The system should be highly available.
Durability: Any uploaded content (photos and videos) should never get lost.
Consistency: We can compromise a little on consistency. It is acceptable if the content (photos or videos) takes time to show in followers’ feeds located in a distant region.
Reliability: The system must be able to tolerate hardware and software failures.
3. Capacity Estimation for Instagram System Design
We have 1 billion users, with 500 million as daily active users. Assume 60 million photos and 35 million videos are shared on Instagram per day. We can consider 3 MB as the maximum size of each photo and 150 MB as the maximum size of each video uploaded on Instagram.On average, each user sends 20 requests (of any type) per day to our service.

10. Scalability for Instagram System Design
Scalability refers to the ability of an organization (or a system, such as a computer network) to perform well under an increased or expanding workload. A system that scales well will be able to maintain or increase its level of performance even as it is tested by larger and larger operational demands.

API Endpoints:

GET /posts/{post_id}: Retrieves details of a post, including the number of likes/dislikes.
POST /posts/{post_id}/like: Registers a like for the post by the authenticated user.
POST /posts/{post_id}/dislike: Registers a dislike for the post by the authenticated user.
DELETE /posts/{post_id}/like: Removes the like for the post by the authenticated user (if previously done).

Scalability: We can add more servers to application service layers to make the scalability better and handle numerous requests from the clients. We can also increase the number of databases to store the growing users’ data.
Latency: The use of cache and CDNs have reduced the content fetching time.
Availability: We have made the system available to the users by using the storage and databases that are replicated across the globe.
Durability: We have persistent storage that maintains the backup of the data so any uploaded content (photos and videos) never gets lost.
Consistency: We have used storage like blob stores and databases to keep our data consistent globally.

3.1 Storage Per Day
Photos: 60 million photos/day * 3 MB = 180 TeraBytes / day
Videos: 35 million videos/day * 150 MB = 5250 TB / day
Total content size = 180 + 5250 = 5430 TB
The Total Space required for a Year:
5430 TB/day * 365 (days a year) = 1981950 TB = 1981.95 PetaBytes

3.2 Bandwidth Estimation
5430 TB/(24 * 60* 60) = 5430 TB/86400 sec ~= 62.84 GB/s ~= 502.8 Gbps
Incoming bandwidth ~= 502.8 Gbps
Let’s say the ratio of readers to writers is 100:1.
Required outgoing bandwidth ~= 100 * 502.8 Gbps ~= 50.28 Tbps

2.1 Functional Requirements for Instagram System Design
In functional Requirements, we will not discuss the login or signup page of Instagram. Login and Signup architecture is the same for everyone. We will look for further like posting photos, etc.

---

If the user is new, they will register firstly it will be store in database, they will verifiy the profile.
If user is already signup, they will provide the email-Id and Password.
On the home page they will get the photos and videos, as well as the story page.
The post which is posted now, it will come at the top. User can follow or unfollow the person. User can get live. It’s all depend on them.
There will be setting, in which user can see there past story or the post which has been archive. User can unblock the person they can get verified account, after paying.
5. Low-Level Design(LLD) for Instagram System Design
design-instagram-lld

Here’s a breakdown of the key components and interactions for Instagram’s low-level design:

---

Availability: The system should be highly available.
Durability: Any uploaded content (photos and videos) should never get lost.
Consistency: We can compromise a little on consistency. It is acceptable if the content (photos or videos) takes time to show in followers’ feeds located in a distant region.
Reliability: The system must be able to tolerate hardware and software failures.
3. Capacity Estimation for Instagram System Design
We have 1 billion users, with 500 million as daily active users. Assume 60 million photos and 35 million videos are shared on Instagram per day. We can consider 3 MB as the maximum size of each photo and 150 MB as the maximum size of each video uploaded on Instagram.On average, each user sends 20 requests (of any type) per day to our service.

Post photos and videos: The users can post photos and videos on Instagram.
Follow and unfollow users: The users can follow and unfollow other users on Instagram.
Like or dislike posts: The users can like or dislike posts of the accounts they follow.
Search photos and videos: The users can search photos and videos based on captions and location.
Generate news feed: The users can view the news feed consisting of the photos and videos (in chronological order) from all the users they follow.
2.2 Non-Functional requirements for Instagram System Design
Scalability: The system should be scalable to handle millions of users in terms of computational resources and storage.
Latency: The latency to generate a news feed should be low.

10. Scalability for Instagram System Design
Scalability refers to the ability of an organization (or a system, such as a computer network) to perform well under an increased or expanding workload. A system that scales well will be able to maintain or increase its level of performance even as it is tested by larger and larger operational demands.

We can add more servers to application service layers to make the scalability better and handle numerous requests from the clients. We can also increase the number of databases to store the growing users’ data.

---

Availability: The system should be highly available.
Durability: Any uploaded content (photos and videos) should never get lost.
Consistency: We can compromise a little on consistency. It is acceptable if the content (photos or videos) takes time to show in followers’ feeds located in a distant region.
Reliability: The system must be able to tolerate hardware and software failures.
3. Capacity Estimation for Instagram System Design
We have 1 billion users, with 500 million as daily active users. Assume 60 million photos and 35 million videos are shared on Instagram per day. We can consider 3 MB as the maximum size of each photo and 150 MB as the maximum size of each video uploaded on Instagram.On average, each user sends 20 requests (of any type) per day to our service.

---

If the user is new, they will register firstly it will be store in database, they will verifiy the profile.
If user is already signup, they will provide the email-Id and Password.
On the home page they will get the photos and videos, as well as the story page.
The post which is posted now, it will come at the top. User can follow or unfollow the person. User can get live. It’s all depend on them.
There will be setting, in which user can see there past story or the post which has been archive. User can unblock the person they can get verified account, after paying.

It emphasizes indexing strategies to quickly fetch data about posts' performance metrics, such as likes and comments received within specific timeframes or by certain users.

The focus is rather on database design and query optimization techniques such as indexing, partitioning data by day or user ID, using compression to save storage space, denormalization where necessary, implementing caching mechanisms, considering archival of old records that are accessed infrequently, choosing appropriate types for each field (e.g., BLOBs instead of larger text fields), and optimizing queries with EXPLAIN plans or other tools available in the database system to understand execution paths better.

Microservices – also known as the microservice architecture – is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of services that are:

Independently deployable
Loosely coupled
Organized around business capabilities
Owned by a small team
The microservice architecture enables an organization to deliver large, complex applications rapidly, frequently, reliably and sustainably – a necessity for competing and winning in today’s world.

Feed Generation adjusts based on changed relationships.
User monitors activity:
Client checks notifications feed.
Notifications provide updates on relevant events.
Key Design Considerations:

---

3.1 Storage Per Day
Photos: 60 million photos/day * 3 MB = 180 TeraBytes / day
Videos: 35 million videos/day * 150 MB = 5250 TB / day
Total content size = 180 + 5250 = 5430 TB
The Total Space required for a Year:
5430 TB/day * 365 (days a year) = 1981950 TB = 1981.95 PetaBytes

3.2 Bandwidth Estimation
5430 TB/(24 * 60* 60) = 5430 TB/86400 sec ~= 62.84 GB/s ~= 502.8 Gbps
Incoming bandwidth ~= 502.8 Gbps
Let’s say the ratio of readers to writers is 100:1.
Required outgoing bandwidth ~= 100 * 502.8 Gbps ~= 50.28 Tbps

8.5 Which Database we should select for Data storing?
It is essential to choose the right kind of database for our Instagram system, but which is the right choice — SQL or NoSQL? Our data is inherently relational, and we need an order for the data (posts should appear in chronological order) and no data loss even in case of failures (data durability). Moreover, in our case, we would benefit from relational queries like fetching the followers or images based on a user ID. Hence, SQL-based databases fulfill these requirements.

We will look for further like posting photos, etc.', metadata={'source': 'documentsFromText/Instagram/content.txt', 'id': 'documentsFromText/Instagram/content.txt:None:2'}), Document(page_content='Availability: The system should be highly available.\nDurability: Any uploaded content (photos and videos) should never get lost.\nConsistency: We can compromise a little on consistency. It is acceptable if the content (photos or videos) takes time to show in followers’ feeds located in a distant region.\nReliability: The system must be able to tolerate hardware and software failures.\n3. Capacity Estimation for Instagram System Design\nWe have 1 billion users, with 500 million as daily active users. Assume 60 million photos and 35 million videos are shared on Instagram per day. We can consider 3 MB as the maximum size of each photo and 150 MB as the maximum size of each video uploaded on Instagram.On average, each user sends 20 requests (of any type) per day to our service.', metadata={'source': 'documentsFromText/Instagram/content.txt', 'id': 'documentsFromText/Instagram/content.txt:None:4'}), Document(page_content='If the user is new, they will register firstly it will be store in database, they will verifiy the profile.\nIf user is already signup, they will provide the email-Id and Password.\nOn the home page they will get the photos and videos, as well as the story page.\nThe post which is posted now, it will come at the top.
