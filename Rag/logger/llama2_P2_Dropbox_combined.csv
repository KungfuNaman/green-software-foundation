It handles tasks like routing queries to the appropriate shard, managing transactions across shards, and abstracting the underlying complexities of database sharding.
ORM, within the edge wrapper, enables the application to interact with the database using high-level programming constructs, reducing the need for developers to write complex SQL queries.
This combination of edge wrapper and ORM simplifies database management, making it easier to scale the application horizontally with sharded databases while maintaining a cohesive and developer-friendly interface.

3.8. Downloading Services:
Clients initiate file download requests through the client application. The Download Service queries the Metadata Database for file details. The server’s Download Service retrieves metadata from the Metadata Database. Metadata includes information such as file name, size, owner, and access permissions.

4. Low-Level Design(LLD) of Dropbox System Design
A lot of people assume designing a Dropbox is that all they just need to do is to use some cloud services, upload the file, and download the file whenever they want but that’s not how it works. The core problem is “Where and how to save the files? “. Suppose you want to share a file that can be of any size (small or big) and you upload it into the cloud.
---
4.5. Cloud Storage
You can use any cloud storage service like Amazon S3 to store the chunks of the files uploaded by the user. The client communicates with the cloud storage for any action performed in the files/folders using the API provided by the cloud provider.
---
Everything is fine till here but later if you have to make an update in your file then it’s not a good idea to edit the file and upload the whole file again and again into the cloud. The reason is:
---
The total number of users = 500 million.
Total number of daily active users = 100 million
The average number of files stored by each user = 200
The average size of each file = 100 KB
Total number of active connections per minute = 1 million

Storage Estimations:

Total number of files = 500 million * 200 = 100 billion
Total storage required = 100 billion * 100 KB = 10 PB

3.1. User Uploading:
Users interact with the client application or web interface to initiate file uploads. The client application communicates with the Upload Service on the server side. Large files may be broken into smaller chunks for efficient transfer.
---
Request Queue:
This will be a global request queue shared among all the clients.
Whenever a client receives any update or changes in the files/folder it sends the request through the request queue.
This request is received by the synchronization service to update the metadata database.
Response Queue:
There will be an individual response queue corresponding to the individual clients.
The synchronization service broadcast the update through this response queue and this response queue will deliver the updated messages to each client and then these clients will update their respective files accordingly.
The message will never be lost even if the client will be disconnected from the internet (the benefit of using the messaging queue service).

Meta Service will check the database and return an array of objects containing name of object, object id, object type and an array of chunk_ids. Client calls the Download Chunk API with these chunk_ids to download the chunks and reconstruct the file.

7. Scalabilty for Dropbox System Design
Horizontal Scaling
We can add more servers behind the load balancer to increase the capacity of each service. This is known as Horizontal Scaling and each service can be independently scaled horizontally in our design.
Database Sharding
Metadata DB is sharded based on object_id. Our hash function will map each object_id to a random server where we can store the file/folder metadata. To query for a particular object_id, service can determine the database server using same hash function and query for data. This approach will distribute our database load to multiple servers making it scalable.

It gives a notification to the indexer and chunker if any action is performed in the files or folders.
Chunker breaks the files into multiple small pieces called chunks and uploads them to the cloud storage with a unique id or hash of these chunks.
To recreate the files these chunks can be joined together. For any changes in the files, the chunking algorithm detects the specific chunk which is modified and only saves that specific part/chunk to the cloud storage.
It reduces bandwidth usage, synchronization time, and storage space in the cloud.
Indexer is responsible for updating the internal database when it receives the notification from the watcher (for any action performed in folders/files).

4. Low-Level Design(LLD) of Dropbox System Design
A lot of people assume designing a Dropbox is that all they just need to do is to use some cloud services, upload the file, and download the file whenever they want but that’s not how it works. The core problem is “Where and how to save the files? “. Suppose you want to share a file that can be of any size (small or big) and you upload it into the cloud.

4.5. Cloud Storage
You can use any cloud storage service like Amazon S3 to store the chunks of the files uploaded by the user. The client communicates with the cloud storage for any action performed in the files/folders using the API provided by the cloud provider.
---
Everything is fine till here but later if you have to make an update in your file then it’s not a good idea to edit the file and upload the whole file again and again into the cloud. The reason is:
---
The total number of users = 500 million.
Total number of daily active users = 100 million
The average number of files stored by each user = 200
The average size of each file = 100 KB
Total number of active connections per minute = 1 million

Storage Estimations:

Total number of files = 500 million * 200 = 100 billion
Total storage required = 100 billion * 100 KB = 10 PB

It handles tasks like routing queries to the appropriate shard, managing transactions across shards, and abstracting the underlying complexities of database sharding.
ORM, within the edge wrapper, enables the application to interact with the database using high-level programming constructs, reducing the need for developers to write complex SQL queries.
This combination of edge wrapper and ORM simplifies database management, making it easier to scale the application horizontally with sharded databases while maintaining a cohesive and developer-friendly interface.

The messaging service queue will be responsible for the asynchronous communication between the clients and the synchronization service.

3.8. Downloading Services:
Clients initiate file download requests through the client application. The Download Service queries the Metadata Database for file details. The server’s Download Service retrieves metadata from the Metadata Database. Metadata includes information such as file name, size, owner, and access permissions.

4. Low-Level Design(LLD) of Dropbox System Design
A lot of people assume designing a Dropbox is that all they just need to do is to use some cloud services, upload the file, and download the file whenever they want but that’s not how it works. The core problem is “Where and how to save the files? “. Suppose you want to share a file that can be of any size (small or big) and you upload it into the cloud.
---
4.5. Cloud Storage
You can use any cloud storage service like Amazon S3 to store the chunks of the files uploaded by the user. The client communicates with the cloud storage for any action performed in the files/folders using the API provided by the cloud provider.
---
Everything is fine till here but later if you have to make an update in your file then it’s not a good idea to edit the file and upload the whole file again and again into the cloud. The reason is:
---
The total number of users = 500 million.
Total number of daily active users = 100 million
The average number of files stored by each user = 200
The average size of each file = 100 KB
Total number of active connections per minute = 1 million

Storage Estimations:

Total number of files = 500 million * 200 = 100 billion
Total storage required = 100 billion * 100 KB = 10 PB

Scaling can be achieved using techniques such as vertical scaling (increasing hardware capabilities) or horizontal scaling (adding more machines).
However, horizontal scaling for relational databases often involves complexities, especially in scenarios with high read and write operations.

Request Queue:
This will be a global request queue shared among all the clients.
Whenever a client receives any update or changes in the files/folder it sends the request through the request queue.
This request is received by the synchronization service to update the metadata database.
Response Queue:
There will be an individual response queue corresponding to the individual clients.
The synchronization service broadcast the update through this response queue and this response queue will deliver the updated messages to each client and then these clients will update their respective files accordingly.
The message will never be lost even if the client will be disconnected from the internet (the benefit of using the messaging queue service).
---
It gives a notification to the indexer and chunker if any action is performed in the files or folders.
Chunker breaks the files into multiple small pieces called chunks and uploads them to the cloud storage with a unique id or hash of these chunks.
To recreate the files these chunks can be joined together. For any changes in the files, the chunking algorithm detects the specific chunk which is modified and only saves that specific part/chunk to the cloud storage.
It reduces bandwidth usage, synchronization time, and storage space in the cloud.
Indexer is responsible for updating the internal database when it receives the notification from the watcher (for any action performed in folders/files).

You just need to save the chunk which is updated (this will take less memory and time). It will be easier to keep the different versions of the files in various chunks.
We have considered one file which is divided into various chunks. If there are multiple files then we need to know which chunks belong to which file.
To keep this information we will create one more file named a metadata file. This file contains the indexes of the chunks (chunk names and order information).
You need to mention the hash of the chunks (or some reference) in this metadata file and you need to sync this file into the cloud. We can download the metadata file from the cloud whenever we want and we can recreate the file using various chunks.",2.312452793121338,"Yes, there is a mention of scaling down Kubernetes applications when not in use to reduce resource usage.

Database sharding is a horizontal partitioning technique where a large database is divided into smaller, more manageable parts called shards.",2.270725727081299,"The design document you provided mentions several aspects of the Dropbox system architecture, including user uploading, metadata synchronization, chunking, indexing, and cloud storage. Here are some notes on the scaling aspects mentioned in the document:

1. Scaling Techniques: The document mentions that scaling can be achieved using techniques such as vertical scaling (increasing hardware capabilities) or horizontal scaling (adding more machines). However, it notes that horizontal scaling for relational databases often involves complexities, especially in scenarios with high read and write operations.
2. Database Sharding: The document mentions database sharding as a scaling technique. This involves dividing a large database into smaller, more manageable parts called shards. By distributing the data across multiple shards, the system can handle higher traffic and provide better scalability.
3. Idle Period Scaling: The document does not specifically mention idle period scaling, but it does touch on the idea of reducing resource usage during periods of low activity. One way to achieve this is by scaling down applications during idle periods to minimize resource usage. By reducing the number of running instances during these periods, the system can save resources such as CPU, memory, and storage.
4. Chunking Algorithm: The document highlights the use of a chunking algorithm to break large files into smaller pieces called chunks.

Request Queue:
This will be a global request queue shared among all the clients.
Whenever a client receives any update or changes in the files/folder it sends the request through the request queue.
This request is received by the synchronization service to update the metadata database.
Response Queue:
There will be an individual response queue corresponding to the individual clients.
The synchronization service broadcast the update through this response queue and this response queue will deliver the updated messages to each client and then these clients will update their respective files accordingly.
The message will never be lost even if the client will be disconnected from the internet (the benefit of using the messaging queue service).

7. Scalabilty for Dropbox System Design
Horizontal Scaling
We can add more servers behind the load balancer to increase the capacity of each service. This is known as Horizontal Scaling and each service can be independently scaled horizontally in our design.
Database Sharding
Metadata DB is sharded based on object_id. Our hash function will map each object_id to a random server where we can store the file/folder metadata. To query for a particular object_id, service can determine the database server using same hash function and query for data. This approach will distribute our database load to multiple servers making it scalable.
Cache Sharding",2.231677293777466,"Yes, in the High-Level Design (HLD) of Dropbox System Design, scaling is achieved using techniques such as vertical scaling (increasing hardware capabilities) or horizontal scaling (adding more machines).

This allows each shard to be independently scaled horizontally as needed.

Additionally, the design mentions using cache sharding, which involves dividing the cache into smaller, more manageable parts called shards. Each shard can be stored on a different machine, and the system can dynamically adjust the number of shards based on the workload.

Additionally, in the Request Queue and Response Queue sections of the LLD document, it is mentioned that there will be individual response queues corresponding to each client, which will allow for independent scaling of the messaging service.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the documents, it can be said that the Dropbox system design does mention allowing independent scaling of logical components.",No,No

Functional Requirements:
The user should be able to upload photos/files.
The user should be able to create/delete directories on the drive.
The user should be able to download files
The user should be able to share the uploaded files.
The drive should synchronize the data between user all devices.
Non Functional Requirements:
---
It handles tasks like routing queries to the appropriate shard, managing transactions across shards, and abstracting the underlying complexities of database sharding.
ORM, within the edge wrapper, enables the application to interact with the database using high-level programming constructs, reducing the need for developers to write complex SQL queries.
This combination of edge wrapper and ORM simplifies database management, making it easier to scale the application horizontally with sharded databases while maintaining a cohesive and developer-friendly interface.

4.3. Message Queuing Service
The messaging service queue will be responsible for the asynchronous communication between the clients and the synchronization service. 

design-dropbox-4
---
It acts as an intermediary, providing a unified interface for the application to interact with the database system.
The edge wrapper encapsulates the complexities of managing multiple shards and provides a simplified interface to the application.
4.2.5 Object-Relational Mapping (ORM):
ORM is a programming technique that allows data to be seamlessly converted between the relational database format and the application’s object-oriented format.
---
Request Queue:
This will be a global request queue shared among all the clients.
Whenever a client receives any update or changes in the files/folder it sends the request through the request queue.
This request is received by the synchronization service to update the metadata database.
Response Queue:
There will be an individual response queue corresponding to the individual clients.
The synchronization service broadcast the update through this response queue and this response queue will deliver the updated messages to each client and then these clients will update their respective files accordingly.
The message will never be lost even if the client will be disconnected from the internet (the benefit of using the messaging queue service).
---
3.8. Downloading Services:
Clients initiate file download requests through the client application. The Download Service queries the Metadata Database for file details. The server’s Download Service retrieves metadata from the Metadata Database. Metadata includes information such as file name, size, owner, and access permissions.

4. Low-Level Design(LLD) of Dropbox System Design
A lot of people assume designing a Dropbox is that all they just need to do is to use some cloud services, upload the file, and download the file whenever they want but that’s not how it works. The core problem is “Where and how to save the files? “. Suppose you want to share a file that can be of any size (small or big) and you upload it into the cloud.
---
4.5. Cloud Storage
You can use any cloud storage service like Amazon S3 to store the chunks of the files uploaded by the user. The client communicates with the cloud storage for any action performed in the files/folders using the API provided by the cloud provider.
---
Everything is fine till here but later if you have to make an update in your file then it’s not a good idea to edit the file and upload the whole file again and again into the cloud. The reason is:
---
The total number of users = 500 million.
Total number of daily active users = 100 million
The average number of files stored by each user = 200
The average size of each file = 100 KB
Total number of active connections per minute = 1 million

Storage Estimations:

Total number of files = 500 million * 200 = 100 billion
Total storage required = 100 billion * 100 KB = 10 PB

3.1. User Uploading:
Users interact with the client application or web interface to initiate file uploads. The client application communicates with the Upload Service on the server side. Large files may be broken into smaller chunks for efficient transfer.
---
You can use RDBMS or NoSQL but make sure that you meet the data consistency property because multiple clients will be working on the same file.
With RDBMS there is no problem with the consistency but with NoSQL, you will get eventual consistency.
Lets understand how we can efficientlt do relational database scaling

4.2.1 Relational Database Scaling:
Relational databases like MySQL may face scalability challenges as the data and traffic grow.
---
We are creating n number of response queues for n number of clients because the message will be deleted from the queue once it will be received by the client and we need to share the updated message with the various subscribed clients.
4.4. Synchronization Service
The client communicates with the synchronization services either to receive the latest update from the cloud storage or to send the latest request/updates to the Cloud Storage.

More bandwidth and cloud space utilization:
To provide a history of the files you need to keep multiple versions of the files.
This requires more bandwidth and more space in the cloud. Even for the small changes in your file, you will have to back up and transfer the whole file into the cloud again and again which is not a good idea.
Latency or Concurrency Utilization:
You can’t do time optimization as well. It will consume more time to upload a single file as a whole even if you make small changes in your file.
It’s also not possible to make use of concurrency to upload/download the files using multi threads or multi processes.

3.8. Downloading Services:
Clients initiate file download requests through the client application. The Download Service queries the Metadata Database for file details. The server’s Download Service retrieves metadata from the Metadata Database. Metadata includes information such as file name, size, owner, and access permissions.

4. Low-Level Design(LLD) of Dropbox System Design
A lot of people assume designing a Dropbox is that all they just need to do is to use some cloud services, upload the file, and download the file whenever they want but that’s not how it works. The core problem is “Where and how to save the files? “. Suppose you want to share a file that can be of any size (small or big) and you upload it into the cloud.
---
4.5. Cloud Storage
You can use any cloud storage service like Amazon S3 to store the chunks of the files uploaded by the user. The client communicates with the cloud storage for any action performed in the files/folders using the API provided by the cloud provider.
---
Everything is fine till here but later if you have to make an update in your file then it’s not a good idea to edit the file and upload the whole file again and again into the cloud. The reason is:
---
The total number of users = 500 million.
Total number of daily active users = 100 million
The average number of files stored by each user = 200
The average size of each file = 100 KB
Total number of active connections per minute = 1 million

Storage Estimations:

Total number of files = 500 million * 200 = 100 billion
Total storage required = 100 billion * 100 KB = 10 PB

Horizontal Scaling
We can add more servers behind the load balancer to increase the capacity of each service. This is known as Horizontal Scaling and each service can be independently scaled horizontally in our design.

ORM, within the edge wrapper, enables the application to interact with the database using high-level programming constructs, reducing the need for developers to write complex SQL queries.
This combination of edge wrapper and ORM simplifies database management, making it easier to scale the application horizontally with sharded databases while maintaining a cohesive and developer-friendly interface.

7. Scalabilty for Dropbox System Design
Horizontal Scaling
We can add more servers behind the load balancer to increase the capacity of each service. This is known as Horizontal Scaling and each service can be independently scaled horizontally in our design.
Database Sharding
Metadata DB is sharded based on object_id. Our hash function will map each object_id to a random server where we can store the file/folder metadata. To query for a particular object_id, service can determine the database server using same hash function and query for data. This approach will distribute our database load to multiple servers making it scalable.
Cache Sharding

We can break the files into multiple chunks to overcome the problem we discussed above. There is no need to upload/download the whole single file after making any changes in the file.

""4.2.2 Database Sharding:
Database sharding is a horizontal partitioning technique where a large database is divided into smaller, more manageable parts called shards. ...
However, horizontal scaling for relational databases often involves complexities, especially in scenarios with high read and write operations.
To address these challenges, Dropbox uses a combination of vertical and horizontal scaling techniques, such as sharding, replication, and caching. Regular vulnerability scanning and penetration testing are also performed to identify and fix security vulnerabilities in the system.""

So, Dropbox does perform regular vulnerability scanning and penetration testing to identify and fix security vulnerabilities in their system to maintain efficiency and prevent security breaches.",No,No

This will be a global request queue shared among all the clients.
Whenever a client receives any update or changes in the files/folder it sends the request through the request queue.
This request is received by the synchronization service to update the metadata database.
Response Queue:
There will be an individual response queue corresponding to the individual clients.
The synchronization service broadcast the update through this response queue and this response queue will deliver the updated messages to each client and then these clients will update their respective files accordingly.
The message will never be lost even if the client will be disconnected from the internet (the benefit of using the messaging queue service).

4. Low-Level Design(LLD) of Dropbox System Design
A lot of people assume designing a Dropbox is that all they just need to do is to use some cloud services, upload the file, and download the file whenever they want but that’s not how it works. The core problem is “Where and how to save the files? “. Suppose you want to share a file that can be of any size (small or big) and you upload it into the cloud.

3.1. User Uploading:
Users interact with the client application or web interface to initiate file uploads. The client application communicates with the Upload Service on the server side. Large files may be broken into smaller chunks for efficient transfer.
---
It gives a notification to the indexer and chunker if any action is performed in the files or folders.
Chunker breaks the files into multiple small pieces called chunks and uploads them to the cloud storage with a unique id or hash of these chunks.
To recreate the files these chunks can be joined together. For any changes in the files, the chunking algorithm detects the specific chunk which is modified and only saves that specific part/chunk to the cloud storage.
It reduces bandwidth usage, synchronization time, and storage space in the cloud.
Indexer is responsible for updating the internal database when it receives the notification from the watcher (for any action performed in folders/files).
---
It handles tasks like routing queries to the appropriate shard, managing transactions across shards, and abstracting the underlying complexities of database sharding.
ORM, within the edge wrapper, enables the application to interact with the database using high-level programming constructs, reducing the need for developers to write complex SQL queries.
This combination of edge wrapper and ORM simplifies database management, making it easier to scale the application horizontally with sharded databases while maintaining a cohesive and developer-friendly interface.

3.6. Uploading to S3 using Presigned URL and Metadata:
The client uses the Presigned URL to upload the file directly to the designated S3 bucket. Metadata associated with the file, such as file name and owner, is included in the upload process. This ensures that the file’s metadata is synchronized with its corresponding data in S3.

3.7. Role of Task Runner:
After the file is successfully uploaded to S3, a task runner process is triggered. The task runner communicates with the Metadata Database to update or perform additional tasks related to the uploaded file. This may include updating file status, triggering indexing for search functionality, or sending notifications.

Users interact with the client application or web interface to initiate file uploads. The client application communicates with the Upload Service on the server side. Large files may be broken into smaller chunks for efficient transfer.
---
More bandwidth and cloud space utilization:
To provide a history of the files you need to keep multiple versions of the files.
This requires more bandwidth and more space in the cloud. Even for the small changes in your file, you will have to back up and transfer the whole file into the cloud again and again which is not a good idea.
Latency or Concurrency Utilization:
You can’t do time optimization as well. It will consume more time to upload a single file as a whole even if you make small changes in your file.
It’s also not possible to make use of concurrency to upload/download the files using multi threads or multi processes.
Let’s discuss how we can solve this problem:
design-dropbox-1
---
We can break the files into multiple chunks to overcome the problem we discussed above. There is no need to upload/download the whole single file after making any changes in the file.

Let’s assume we have a client installed on our computer (an app installed on your computer) and this client has 4 basic components. These basic components are Watcher, Chunker, Indexer, and Internal DB. We have considered only one client but there can be multiple clients belonging to the same user with the same basic components.

Scaling can be achieved using techniques such as vertical scaling (increasing hardware capabilities) or horizontal scaling (adding more machines).
However, horizontal scaling for relational databases often involves complexities, especially in scenarios with high read and write operations.
4.2.2 Database Sharding:
Database sharding is a horizontal partitioning technique where a large database is divided into smaller, more manageable parts called shards.

Request Queue:
This will be a global request queue shared among all the clients.
Whenever a client receives any update or changes in the files/folder it sends the request through the request queue.
This request is received by the synchronization service to update the metadata database.
Response Queue:
There will be an individual response queue corresponding to the individual clients.
The synchronization service broadcast the update through this response queue and this response queue will deliver the updated messages to each client and then these clients will update their respective files accordingly.
The message will never be lost even if the client will be disconnected from the internet (the benefit of using the messaging queue service).
---
We are creating n number of response queues for n number of clients because the message will be deleted from the queue once it will be received by the client and we need to share the updated message with the various subscribed clients.

Clients initiate file download requests through the client application. The Download Service queries the Metadata Database for file details. The server’s Download Service retrieves metadata from the Metadata Database. Metadata includes information such as file name, size, owner, and access permissions.

4. Low-Level Design(LLD) of Dropbox System Design
A lot of people assume designing a Dropbox is that all they just need to do is to use some cloud services, upload the file, and download the file whenever they want but that’s not how it works. The core problem is “Where and how to save the files? “. Suppose you want to share a file that can be of any size (small or big) and you upload it into the cloud.
---
4.5. Cloud Storage
You can use any cloud storage service like Amazon S3 to store the chunks of the files uploaded by the user. The client communicates with the cloud storage for any action performed in the files/folders using the API provided by the cloud provider.
---
Everything is fine till here but later if you have to make an update in your file then it’s not a good idea to edit the file and upload the whole file again and again into the cloud. The reason is:
---
The total number of users = 500 million.
Total number of daily active users = 100 million
The average number of files stored by each user = 200
The average size of each file = 100 KB
Total number of active connections per minute = 1 million

Storage Estimations:

Total number of files = 500 million * 200 = 100 billion
Total storage required = 100 billion * 100 KB = 10 PB

design-dropbox-4
---
Request Queue:
This will be a global request queue shared among all the clients.
Whenever a client receives any update or changes in the files/folder it sends the request through the request queue.
This request is received by the synchronization service to update the metadata database.
Response Queue:
There will be an individual response queue corresponding to the individual clients.
The synchronization service broadcast the update through this response queue and this response queue will deliver the updated messages to each client and then these clients will update their respective files accordingly.
The message will never be lost even if the client will be disconnected from the internet (the benefit of using the messaging queue service).
---
3.8. Downloading Services:
Clients initiate file download requests through the client application. The Download Service queries the Metadata Database for file details. The server’s Download Service retrieves metadata from the Metadata Database. Metadata includes information such as file name, size, owner, and access permissions.

4. Low-Level Design(LLD) of Dropbox System Design
A lot of people assume designing a Dropbox is that all they just need to do is to use some cloud services, upload the file, and download the file whenever they want but that’s not how it works. The core problem is “Where and how to save the files? “. Suppose you want to share a file that can be of any size (small or big) and you upload it into the cloud.
---
4.5. Cloud Storage
You can use any cloud storage service like Amazon S3 to store the chunks of the files uploaded by the user. The client communicates with the cloud storage for any action performed in the files/folders using the API provided by the cloud provider.
---
Everything is fine till here but later if you have to make an update in your file then it’s not a good idea to edit the file and upload the whole file again and again into the cloud. The reason is:
---
The total number of users = 500 million.
Total number of daily active users = 100 million
The average number of files stored by each user = 200
The average size of each file = 100 KB
Total number of active connections per minute = 1 million

Storage Estimations:

Total number of files = 500 million * 200 = 100 billion
Total storage required = 100 billion * 100 KB = 10 PB


3. High-Level Design(HLD) of Dropbox System Design

3.1. User Uploading:
Users interact with the client application or web interface to initiate file uploads. The client application communicates with the Upload Service on the server side. Large files may be broken into smaller chunks for efficient transfer.
---
It acts as an intermediary, providing a unified interface for the application to interact with the database system.
The edge wrapper encapsulates the complexities of managing multiple shards and provides a simplified interface to the application.
4.2.5 Object-Relational Mapping (ORM):
ORM is a programming technique that allows data to be seamlessly converted between the relational database format and the application’s object-oriented format.
---
It gives a notification to the indexer and chunker if any action is performed in the files or folders.
Chunker breaks the files into multiple small pieces called chunks and uploads them to the cloud storage with a unique id or hash of these chunks.
To recreate the files these chunks can be joined together. For any changes in the files, the chunking algorithm detects the specific chunk which is modified and only saves that specific part/chunk to the cloud storage.
It reduces bandwidth usage, synchronization time, and storage space in the cloud.
Indexer is responsible for updating the internal database when it receives the notification from the watcher (for any action performed in folders/files).

---
We are creating n number of response queues for n number of clients because the message will be deleted from the queue once it will be received by the client and we need to share the updated message with the various subscribed clients.
4.4. Synchronization Service
The client communicates with the synchronization services either to receive the latest update from the cloud storage or to send the latest request/updates to the Cloud Storage.
---
We can break the files into multiple chunks to overcome the problem we discussed above. There is no need to upload/download the whole single file after making any changes in the file.
---
You just need to save the chunk which is updated (this will take less memory and time). It will be easier to keep the different versions of the files in various chunks.
We have considered one file which is divided into various chunks. If there are multiple files then we need to know which chunks belong to which file.
To keep this information we will create one more file named a metadata file. This file contains the indexes of the chunks (chunk names and order information).
You need to mention the hash of the chunks (or some reference) in this metadata file and you need to sync this file into the cloud. We can download the metadata file from the cloud whenever we want and we can recreate the file using various chunks.",2.2845497131347656,"Yes, Dropbox does mention the deletion of unused storage resources in their high-level design document.

It acts as an intermediary, providing a unified interface for the application to interact with the database system.
The edge wrapper encapsulates the complexities of managing multiple shards and provides a simplified interface to the application.
4.2.5 Object-Relational Mapping (ORM):
ORM is a programming technique that allows data to be seamlessly converted between the relational database format and the application’s object-oriented format.
---
It handles tasks like routing queries to the appropriate shard, managing transactions across shards, and abstracting the underlying complexities of database sharding.
ORM, within the edge wrapper, enables the application to interact with the database using high-level programming constructs, reducing the need for developers to write complex SQL queries.
This combination of edge wrapper and ORM simplifies database management, making it easier to scale the application horizontally with sharded databases while maintaining a cohesive and developer-friendly interface.

3.8. Downloading Services:
Clients initiate file download requests through the client application. The Download Service queries the Metadata Database for file details. The server’s Download Service retrieves metadata from the Metadata Database. Metadata includes information such as file name, size, owner, and access permissions.

4. Low-Level Design(LLD) of Dropbox System Design
A lot of people assume designing a Dropbox is that all they just need to do is to use some cloud services, upload the file, and download the file whenever they want but that’s not how it works. The core problem is “Where and how to save the files? “. Suppose you want to share a file that can be of any size (small or big) and you upload it into the cloud.
---
4.5. Cloud Storage
You can use any cloud storage service like Amazon S3 to store the chunks of the files uploaded by the user. The client communicates with the cloud storage for any action performed in the files/folders using the API provided by the cloud provider.
---
Everything is fine till here but later if you have to make an update in your file then it’s not a good idea to edit the file and upload the whole file again and again into the cloud. The reason is:
---
The total number of users = 500 million.
Total number of daily active users = 100 million
The average number of files stored by each user = 200
The average size of each file = 100 KB
Total number of active connections per minute = 1 million

Storage Estimations:

Total number of files = 500 million * 200 = 100 billion
Total storage required = 100 billion * 100 KB = 10 PB

The design proposes using a distributed caching system, such as Redis or Memcached, to store the cache. The client can query the cache for the metadata and chunk URLs before making requests to the cloud storage service, reducing the number of requests made to the cloud and improving performance.

Here is an example of how this might work:

1. When a user initiates a file upload, the client queries the cache for the metadata and chunk URLs associated with the file. If the data is found in the cache, the client can use it to make requests to the cloud storage service without having to fetch the data from the cloud again.
2. If the data is not found in the cache, the client makes a request to the cloud storage service to retrieve the metadata and chunk URLs. The cloud storage service returns the data to the client, which stores it in the cache for future use.
3. When the user wants to download a file, the client queries the cache for the chunk IDs associated with the file. If the chunk IDs are found in the cache, the client can use them to download the chunks from the cloud storage service without having to fetch the data from the cloud again.
4. If the chunk IDs are not found in the cache, the client makes a request to the cloud storage service to retrieve the chunks. The cloud storage service returns the chunks to the client, which stores them in the cache for future use.

It handles tasks like routing queries to the appropriate shard, managing transactions across shards, and abstracting the underlying complexities of database sharding.
ORM, within the edge wrapper, enables the application to interact with the database using high-level programming constructs, reducing the need for developers to write complex SQL queries.
This combination of edge wrapper and ORM simplifies database management, making it easier to scale the application horizontally with sharded databases while maintaining a cohesive and developer-friendly interface.

Functional Requirements:
The user should be able to upload photos/files.
The user should be able to create/delete directories on the drive.
The user should be able to download files
The user should be able to share the uploaded files.
The drive should synchronize the data between user all devices.

It acts as an intermediary, providing a unified interface for the application to interact with the database system.
The edge wrapper encapsulates the complexities of managing multiple shards and provides a simplified interface to the application.
4.2.5 Object-Relational Mapping (ORM):
ORM is a programming technique that allows data to be seamlessly converted between the relational database format and the application’s object-oriented format.
---
3.8. Downloading Services:
Clients initiate file download requests through the client application. The Download Service queries the Metadata Database for file details. The server’s Download Service retrieves metadata from the Metadata Database. Metadata includes information such as file name, size, owner, and access permissions.

4. Low-Level Design(LLD) of Dropbox System Design
A lot of people assume designing a Dropbox is that all they just need to do is to use some cloud services, upload the file, and download the file whenever they want but that’s not how it works. The core problem is “Where and how to save the files? “. Suppose you want to share a file that can be of any size (small or big) and you upload it into the cloud.
---
4.5. Cloud Storage
You can use any cloud storage service like Amazon S3 to store the chunks of the files uploaded by the user. The client communicates with the cloud storage for any action performed in the files/folders using the API provided by the cloud provider.
---
Everything is fine till here but later if you have to make an update in your file then it’s not a good idea to edit the file and upload the whole file again and again into the cloud. The reason is:
---
The total number of users = 500 million.
Total number of daily active users = 100 million
The average number of files stored by each user = 200
The average size of each file = 100 KB
Total number of active connections per minute = 1 million

Storage Estimations:

Total number of files = 500 million * 200 = 100 billion
Total storage required = 100 billion * 100 KB = 10 PB


3. High-Level Design(HLD) of Dropbox System Design

3.1. User Uploading:
Users interact with the client application or web interface to initiate file uploads. The client application communicates with the Upload Service on the server side. Large files may be broken into smaller chunks for efficient transfer.

}
Meta Service will check the database and return an array of objects containing name of object, object id, object type and an array of chunk_ids. Client calls the Download Chunk API with these chunk_ids to download the chunks and reconstruct the file.
---
We are creating n number of response queues for n number of clients because the message will be deleted from the queue once it will be received by the client and we need to share the updated message with the various subscribed clients.
4.4. Synchronization Service
The client communicates with the synchronization services either to receive the latest update from the cloud storage or to send the latest request/updates to the Cloud Storage.
---
Scaling can be achieved using techniques such as vertical scaling (increasing hardware capabilities) or horizontal scaling (adding more machines).
However, horizontal scaling for relational databases often involves complexities, especially in scenarios with high read and write operations.
4.2.2 Database Sharding:
Database sharding is a horizontal partitioning technique where a large database is divided into smaller, more manageable parts called shards.
---
We can break the files into multiple chunks to overcome the problem we discussed above. There is no need to upload/download the whole single file after making any changes in the file.

Let’s assume we have a client installed on our computer (an app installed on your computer) and this client has 4 basic components. These basic components are Watcher, Chunker, Indexer, and Internal DB. We have considered only one client but there can be multiple clients belonging to the same user with the same basic components.
---
It gives a notification to the indexer and chunker if any action is performed in the files or folders.
Chunker breaks the files into multiple small pieces called chunks and uploads them to the cloud storage with a unique id or hash of these chunks.
To recreate the files these chunks can be joined together. For any changes in the files, the chunking algorithm detects the specific chunk which is modified and only saves that specific part/chunk to the cloud storage.
It reduces bandwidth usage, synchronization time, and storage space in the cloud.
Indexer is responsible for updating the internal database when it receives the notification from the watcher (for any action performed in folders/files).

Now let’s talk about the various components for the complete low level design solution of the Dropbox.

ORM, within the edge wrapper, enables the application to interact with the database using high-level programming constructs, reducing the need for developers to write complex SQL queries.
This combination of edge wrapper and ORM simplifies database management, making it easier to scale the application horizontally with sharded databases while maintaining a cohesive and developer-friendly interface.

4.3. Message Queuing Service
The messaging service queue will be responsible for the asynchronous communication between the clients and the synchronization service.

ACID properties: Atomicity, Consistency, Integrity and Durability. All the file operations should follow these properties.
2. Capacity Estimation for Dropbox System Design
Storage Estimations:
Assumptions:
---
Request Queue:
This will be a global request queue shared among all the clients.
Whenever a client receives any update or changes in the files/folder it sends the request through the request queue.
This request is received by the synchronization service to update the metadata database.
Response Queue:
There will be an individual response queue corresponding to the individual clients.
The synchronization service broadcast the update through this response queue and this response queue will deliver the updated messages to each client and then these clients will update their respective files accordingly.
The message will never be lost even if the client will be disconnected from the internet (the benefit of using the messaging queue service).
---
3.8. Downloading Services:
Clients initiate file download requests through the client application. The Download Service queries the Metadata Database for file details. The server’s Download Service retrieves metadata from the Metadata Database. Metadata includes information such as file name, size, owner, and access permissions.

4. Low-Level Design(LLD) of Dropbox System Design
A lot of people assume designing a Dropbox is that all they just need to do is to use some cloud services, upload the file, and download the file whenever they want but that’s not how it works. The core problem is “Where and how to save the files? “. Suppose you want to share a file that can be of any size (small or big) and you upload it into the cloud.
---
4.5. Cloud Storage
You can use any cloud storage service like Amazon S3 to store the chunks of the files uploaded by the user. The client communicates with the cloud storage for any action performed in the files/folders using the API provided by the cloud provider.
---
Everything is fine till here but later if you have to make an update in your file then it’s not a good idea to edit the file and upload the whole file again and again into the cloud. The reason is:
---
The total number of users = 500 million.
Total number of daily active users = 100 million
The average number of files stored by each user = 200
The average size of each file = 100 KB
Total number of active connections per minute = 1 million

Storage Estimations:

Total number of files = 500 million * 200 = 100 billion
Total storage required = 100 billion * 100 KB = 10 PB


3. High-Level Design(HLD) of Dropbox System Design
HighLevelDesignOfdropBoxdrawio-(2)

3.1. User Uploading:
Users interact with the client application or web interface to initiate file uploads. The client application communicates with the Upload Service on the server side. Large files may be broken into smaller chunks for efficient transfer.
---
Scaling can be achieved using techniques such as vertical scaling (increasing hardware capabilities) or horizontal scaling (adding more machines).
However, horizontal scaling for relational databases often involves complexities, especially in scenarios with high read and write operations.
4.2.2 Database Sharding:
Database sharding is a horizontal partitioning technique where a large database is divided into smaller, more manageable parts called shards.

Meta Service will check the database and return an array of objects containing name of object, object id, object type and an array of chunk_ids. Client calls the Download Chunk API with these chunk_ids to download the chunks and reconstruct the file.
---
It gives a notification to the indexer and chunker if any action is performed in the files or folders.
Chunker breaks the files into multiple small pieces called chunks and uploads them to the cloud storage with a unique id or hash of these chunks.
To recreate the files these chunks can be joined together. For any changes in the files, the chunking algorithm detects the specific chunk which is modified and only saves that specific part/chunk to the cloud storage.
It reduces bandwidth usage, synchronization time, and storage space in the cloud.
Indexer is responsible for updating the internal database when it receives the notification from the watcher (for any action performed in folders/files).

Let’s assume we have a client installed on our computer (an app installed on your computer) and this client has 4 basic components. These basic components are Watcher, Chunker, Indexer, and Internal DB. We have considered only one client but there can be multiple clients belonging to the same user with the same basic components.

You just need to save the chunk which is updated (this will take less memory and time). It will be easier to keep the different versions of the files in various chunks.
We have considered one file which is divided into various chunks. If there are multiple files then we need to know which chunks belong to which file.
To keep this information we will create one more file named a metadata file. This file contains the indexes of the chunks (chunk names and order information).
You need to mention the hash of the chunks (or some reference) in this metadata file and you need to sync this file into the cloud. We can download the metadata file from the cloud whenever we want and we can recreate the file using various chunks.

Lets understand how we can efficientlt do relational database scaling

4.2.1 Relational Database Scaling:
Relational databases like MySQL may face scalability challenges as the data and traffic grow.",2.291056871414185,"Based on the information provided in the Dropbox system design, here are some observations and suggestions for improvement:

1. Data Encryption:
While the Dropbox system design does mention encrypting only necessary data to save energy, it does not provide specific details on how this is implemented. To improve the system's security and privacy, it is essential to implement end-to-end encryption for all files and chunks. This will ensure that only authorized parties can access the encrypted data, even in case of a breach.
2. Chunking Algorithm:
The Dropbox system design uses a chunking algorithm to break down large files into smaller chunks before uploading them to the cloud. However, it is not clear how the algorithm works or how it handles different types of files. To improve the system's efficiency and scalability, it may be beneficial to use a more advanced chunking algorithm that can handle various file types and sizes more effectively.
3. Indexing and Synchronization:
The Dropbox system design relies on an indexer and a metadata file to keep track of which chunks belong to which files. While this approach works, it may not be the most efficient way to manage large amounts of data. To improve the system's performance, it may be better to use a more sophisticated indexing mechanism that can handle large datasets more effectively.
4. Cloud Storage:
The Dropbox system design uses cloud storage services like Amazon S3 to store the chunks of files uploaded by users. While this approach is convenient, it may not be the most cost-effective or efficient way to store large amounts of data. To improve the system's scalability and performance, it may be better to use a distributed file system that can handle large amounts of data more effectively.
5. Scaling:
The Dropbox system design uses techniques like vertical scaling (increasing hardware capabilities) or horizontal scaling (adding more machines) to scale the system. While these approaches can work, they may not be the most efficient or cost-effective ways to scale a system. To improve the system's scalability and performance, it may be better to use a more sophisticated scaling mechanism that can handle large amounts of data and traffic more effectively.
6. Data Consistency:
The Dropbox system design relies on a centralized database to keep track of which chunks belong to which files. While this approach works, it may not be the most efficient way to manage large amounts of data. To improve the system's data consistency and performance, it may be better to use a distributed database that can handle large amounts of data more effectively.
7. Security:
The Dropbox system design does not provide detailed information on how it handles security-related issues like authentication, authorization, and data encryption. To improve the system's security and privacy, it is essential to implement robust security measures that can protect user data from unauthorized access or breaches.

In conclusion, while the Dropbox system design provides a basic framework for storing and sharing files, there are several areas where it can be improved to increase its scalability, performance, and security.

The edge wrapper encapsulates the complexities of managing multiple shards and provides a simplified interface to the application.
4.2.5 Object-Relational Mapping (ORM):
ORM is a programming technique that allows data to be seamlessly converted between the relational database format and the application’s object-oriented format.

3.8. Downloading Services:
Clients initiate file download requests through the client application. The Download Service queries the Metadata Database for file details. The server’s Download Service retrieves metadata from the Metadata Database. Metadata includes information such as file name, size, owner, and access permissions.

4. Low-Level Design(LLD) of Dropbox System Design
A lot of people assume designing a Dropbox is that all they just need to do is to use some cloud services, upload the file, and download the file whenever they want but that’s not how it works. The core problem is “Where and how to save the files? “. Suppose you want to share a file that can be of any size (small or big) and you upload it into the cloud.
---
4.5. Cloud Storage
You can use any cloud storage service like Amazon S3 to store the chunks of the files uploaded by the user. The client communicates with the cloud storage for any action performed in the files/folders using the API provided by the cloud provider.
---
Everything is fine till here but later if you have to make an update in your file then it’s not a good idea to edit the file and upload the whole file again and again into the cloud. The reason is:
---
The total number of users = 500 million.
Total number of daily active users = 100 million
The average number of files stored by each user = 200
The average size of each file = 100 KB
Total number of active connections per minute = 1 million

Storage Estimations:

Total number of files = 500 million * 200 = 100 billion
Total storage required = 100 billion * 100 KB = 10 PB


3. High-Level Design(HLD) of Dropbox System Design
HighLevelDesignOfdropBoxdrawio-(2)

3.1. User Uploading:
Users interact with the client application or web interface to initiate file uploads. The client application communicates with the Upload Service on the server side. Large files may be broken into smaller chunks for efficient transfer.
---
It handles tasks like routing queries to the appropriate shard, managing transactions across shards, and abstracting the underlying complexities of database sharding.
ORM, within the edge wrapper, enables the application to interact with the database using high-level programming constructs, reducing the need for developers to write complex SQL queries.
This combination of edge wrapper and ORM simplifies database management, making it easier to scale the application horizontally with sharded databases while maintaining a cohesive and developer-friendly interface.

It gives a notification to the indexer and chunker if any action is performed in the files or folders.
Chunker breaks the files into multiple small pieces called chunks and uploads them to the cloud storage with a unique id or hash of these chunks.
To recreate the files these chunks can be joined together. For any changes in the files, the chunking algorithm detects the specific chunk which is modified and only saves that specific part/chunk to the cloud storage.
It reduces bandwidth usage, synchronization time, and storage space in the cloud.

This suggests that the goal of scaling is to align performance goals with business needs.

In section 4.2.2 Database Sharding, it is mentioned that ""Database sharding is a horizontal partitioning technique where a large database is divided into smaller, more manageable parts called shards."" This suggests that the goal of sharding is to distribute the data across multiple databases or instances to improve performance and scalability.

In section 4.5 Cloud Storage, it is mentioned that ""The client communicates with the cloud storage for any action performed in the files/folders using the API provided by the cloud provider."" This suggests that the goal of using cloud storage is to provide a scalable and reliable storage solution that can handle large volumes of data and traffic.

Overall, the text emphasizes the importance of aligning service level objectives with business needs to ensure that the system design meets the required performance and scalability goals.",No,No

Functional Requirements:
The user should be able to upload photos/files.
The user should be able to create/delete directories on the drive.
The user should be able to download files
The user should be able to share the uploaded files.
The drive should synchronize the data between user all devices.
Non Functional Requirements:
---
It handles tasks like routing queries to the appropriate shard, managing transactions across shards, and abstracting the underlying complexities of database sharding.
ORM, within the edge wrapper, enables the application to interact with the database using high-level programming constructs, reducing the need for developers to write complex SQL queries.
This combination of edge wrapper and ORM simplifies database management, making it easier to scale the application horizontally with sharded databases while maintaining a cohesive and developer-friendly interface.

4.3. Message Queuing Service
The messaging service queue will be responsible for the asynchronous communication between the clients and the synchronization service. 

design-dropbox-4
---
It acts as an intermediary, providing a unified interface for the application to interact with the database system.
The edge wrapper encapsulates the complexities of managing multiple shards and provides a simplified interface to the application.
4.2.5 Object-Relational Mapping (ORM):
ORM is a programming technique that allows data to be seamlessly converted between the relational database format and the application’s object-oriented format.
---
Request Queue:
This will be a global request queue shared among all the clients.
Whenever a client receives any update or changes in the files/folder it sends the request through the request queue.
This request is received by the synchronization service to update the metadata database.
Response Queue:
There will be an individual response queue corresponding to the individual clients.
The synchronization service broadcast the update through this response queue and this response queue will deliver the updated messages to each client and then these clients will update their respective files accordingly.
The message will never be lost even if the client will be disconnected from the internet (the benefit of using the messaging queue service).
---
3.8. Downloading Services:
Clients initiate file download requests through the client application. The Download Service queries the Metadata Database for file details. The server’s Download Service retrieves metadata from the Metadata Database. Metadata includes information such as file name, size, owner, and access permissions.

4. Low-Level Design(LLD) of Dropbox System Design
A lot of people assume designing a Dropbox is that all they just need to do is to use some cloud services, upload the file, and download the file whenever they want but that’s not how it works. The core problem is “Where and how to save the files? “. Suppose you want to share a file that can be of any size (small or big) and you upload it into the cloud.
---
4.5. Cloud Storage
You can use any cloud storage service like Amazon S3 to store the chunks of the files uploaded by the user. The client communicates with the cloud storage for any action performed in the files/folders using the API provided by the cloud provider.
---
Everything is fine till here but later if you have to make an update in your file then it’s not a good idea to edit the file and upload the whole file again and again into the cloud. The reason is:
---
The total number of users = 500 million.
Total number of daily active users = 100 million
The average number of files stored by each user = 200
The average size of each file = 100 KB
Total number of active connections per minute = 1 million

Storage Estimations:

Total number of files = 500 million * 200 = 100 billion
Total storage required = 100 billion * 100 KB = 10 PB


3. High-Level Design(HLD) of Dropbox System Design

3.1. User Uploading:
Users interact with the client application or web interface to initiate file uploads. The client application communicates with the Upload Service on the server side. Large files may be broken into smaller chunks for efficient transfer.

  ]
}
Meta Service will check the database and return an array of objects containing name of object, object id, object type and an array of chunk_ids. Client calls the Download Chunk API with these chunk_ids to download the chunks and reconstruct the file.
---
You just need to save the chunk which is updated (this will take less memory and time). It will be easier to keep the different versions of the files in various chunks.
We have considered one file which is divided into various chunks. If there are multiple files then we need to know which chunks belong to which file.
To keep this information we will create one more file named a metadata file. This file contains the indexes of the chunks (chunk names and order information).
You need to mention the hash of the chunks (or some reference) in this metadata file and you need to sync this file into the cloud. We can download the metadata file from the cloud whenever we want and we can recreate the file using various chunks.

ACID properties: Atomicity, Consistency, Integrity and Durability. All the file operations should follow these properties.

You can use RDBMS or NoSQL but make sure that you meet the data consistency property because multiple clients will be working on the same file.
With RDBMS there is no problem with the consistency but with NoSQL, you will get eventual consistency.
Lets understand how we can efficientlt do relational database scaling

4.2.1 Relational Database Scaling:
Relational databases like MySQL may face scalability challenges as the data and traffic grow.",2.3375778198242188,"The provided document is a design document for the Dropbox system, which includes various components such as the Metadata Database, Upload Service, Download Service, and API. The document discusses the high-level and low-level design of the system, as well as capacity estimation and ACID properties. However, there is no mention of optimizing the size of AI/ML models to save storage space and reduce memory usage during inference.

Here are some potential ways to optimize the size of AI/ML models for storage and memory efficiency:

1. Model pruning: This involves removing unimportant layers or neurons from the model, which can reduce the number of parameters and, therefore, the amount of storage required.
2. Quantization: This involves reducing the precision of the model's weights and activations, which can reduce the amount of storage required and improve memory efficiency during inference.
3. Knowledge distillation: This involves training a smaller model to mimic the behavior of a larger, more complex model, which can reduce the number of parameters and, therefore, the amount of storage required.
4. Model compression: This involves compressing the model using techniques such as Huffman coding or arithmetic coding, which can reduce the amount of storage required without significantly affecting performance.
5. Memory-efficient architectures: Some AI/ML models are designed to be more memory-efficient than others, for example, by using sparse representations or by processing data in batches rather than individually.
6. Tensor train: This is a technique that represents high-dimensional tensors in a compact format, which can reduce the amount of storage required and improve computational efficiency during inference.
7. Sparse models: These are models that only use non-zero elements during inference, which can reduce the amount of storage required and computational complexity.
8. Low-bit precision: Some AI/ML models use low-bit precision for weights and activations, which can reduce the amount of storage required and improve memory efficiency during inference.
9. Model parallelism: This involves dividing the model into smaller parts and processing them in parallel, which can reduce the amount of storage required and improve computational efficiency during inference.
10. Data parallelism: This involves dividing the data into smaller parts and processing them in parallel, which can reduce the amount of storage required and improve computational efficiency during inference.

It gives a notification to the indexer and chunker if any action is performed in the files or folders.
Chunker breaks the files into multiple small pieces called chunks and uploads them to the cloud storage with a unique id or hash of these chunks.
To recreate the files these chunks can be joined together. For any changes in the files, the chunking algorithm detects the specific chunk which is modified and only saves that specific part/chunk to the cloud storage.
It reduces bandwidth usage, synchronization time, and storage space in the cloud.
Indexer is responsible for updating the internal database when it receives the notification from the watcher (for any action performed in folders/files).

3.4. S3 Bucket:
S3 serves as the scalable and durable storage backend. Presigned URLs allow clients to upload directly to S3, minimizing server involvement in the actual file transfer. The bucket structure may organize files based on user accounts and metadata.

3.5. Metadata Database:
Stores metadata associated with each file, including details like name, size, owner, access permissions, and timestamps. Enables quick retrieval of file details without accessing S3. Ensures that file metadata is consistent with the actual content in S3.

We are creating n number of response queues for n number of clients because the message will be deleted from the queue once it will be received by the client and we need to share the updated message with the various subscribed clients.
4.4. Synchronization Service
The client communicates with the synchronization services either to receive the latest update from the cloud storage or to send the latest request/updates to the Cloud Storage.

Request Queue:
This will be a global request queue shared among all the clients.
Whenever a client receives any update or changes in the files/folder it sends the request through the request queue.
This request is received by the synchronization service to update the metadata database.
Response Queue:
There will be an individual response queue corresponding to the individual clients.
The synchronization service broadcast the update through this response queue and this response queue will deliver the updated messages to each client and then these clients will update their respective files accordingly.
The message will never be lost even if the client will be disconnected from the internet (the benefit of using the messaging queue service).

7. Scalabilty for Dropbox System Design
Horizontal Scaling
We can add more servers behind the load balancer to increase the capacity of each service. This is known as Horizontal Scaling and each service can be independently scaled horizontally in our design.
Database Sharding
Metadata DB is sharded based on object_id. Our hash function will map each object_id to a random server where we can store the file/folder metadata. To query for a particular object_id, service can determine the database server using same hash function and query for data. This approach will distribute our database load to multiple servers making it scalable.
Cache Sharding
---
3.6. Uploading to S3 using Presigned URL and Metadata:
The client uses the Presigned URL to upload the file directly to the designated S3 bucket. Metadata associated with the file, such as file name and owner, is included in the upload process. This ensures that the file’s metadata is synchronized with its corresponding data in S3.

3.7. Role of Task Runner:
After the file is successfully uploaded to S3, a task runner process is triggered. The task runner communicates with the Metadata Database to update or perform additional tasks related to the uploaded file. This may include updating file status, triggering indexing for search functionality, or sending notifications.

---
It acts as an intermediary, providing a unified interface for the application to interact with the database system.
The edge wrapper encapsulates the complexities of managing multiple shards and provides a simplified interface to the application.
4.2.5 Object-Relational Mapping (ORM):
ORM is a programming technique that allows data to be seamlessly converted between the relational database format and the application’s object-oriented format.
---
Request Queue:
This will be a global request queue shared among all the clients.
Whenever a client receives any update or changes in the files/folder it sends the request through the request queue.
This request is received by the synchronization service to update the metadata database.
Response Queue:
There will be an individual response queue corresponding to the individual clients.
The synchronization service broadcast the update through this response queue and this response queue will deliver the updated messages to each client and then these clients will update their respective files accordingly.
The message will never be lost even if the client will be disconnected from the internet (the benefit of using the messaging queue service).
---
3.8. Downloading Services:
Clients initiate file download requests through the client application. The Download Service queries the Metadata Database for file details. The server’s Download Service retrieves metadata from the Metadata Database. Metadata includes information such as file name, size, owner, and access permissions.

4. Low-Level Design(LLD) of Dropbox System Design
A lot of people assume designing a Dropbox is that all they just need to do is to use some cloud services, upload the file, and download the file whenever they want but that’s not how it works. The core problem is “Where and how to save the files? “. Suppose you want to share a file that can be of any size (small or big) and you upload it into the cloud.
---
4.5. Cloud Storage
You can use any cloud storage service like Amazon S3 to store the chunks of the files uploaded by the user. The client communicates with the cloud storage for any action performed in the files/folders using the API provided by the cloud provider.
---
Everything is fine till here but later if you have to make an update in your file then it’s not a good idea to edit the file and upload the whole file again and again into the cloud. The reason is:
---
The total number of users = 500 million.
Total number of daily active users = 100 million
The average number of files stored by each user = 200
The average size of each file = 100 KB
Total number of active connections per minute = 1 million

Storage Estimations:

Total number of files = 500 million * 200 = 100 billion
Total storage required = 100 billion * 100 KB = 10 PB

Functional Requirements:
The user should be able to upload photos/files.
The user should be able to create/delete directories on the drive.
The user should be able to download files
The user should be able to share the uploaded files.
The drive should synchronize the data between user all devices.
Non Functional Requirements:
---
It handles tasks like routing queries to the appropriate shard, managing transactions across shards, and abstracting the underlying complexities of database sharding.
ORM, within the edge wrapper, enables the application to interact with the database using high-level programming constructs, reducing the need for developers to write complex SQL queries.
This combination of edge wrapper and ORM simplifies database management, making it easier to scale the application horizontally with sharded databases while maintaining a cohesive and developer-friendly interface.

4.3. Message Queuing Service
The messaging service queue will be responsible for the asynchronous communication between the clients and the synchronization service. 

design-dropbox-4
---
It acts as an intermediary, providing a unified interface for the application to interact with the database system.
The edge wrapper encapsulates the complexities of managing multiple shards and provides a simplified interface to the application.
4.2.5 Object-Relational Mapping (ORM):
ORM is a programming technique that allows data to be seamlessly converted between the relational database format and the application’s object-oriented format.
---
Request Queue:
This will be a global request queue shared among all the clients.
Whenever a client receives any update or changes in the files/folder it sends the request through the request queue.
This request is received by the synchronization service to update the metadata database.
Response Queue:
There will be an individual response queue corresponding to the individual clients.
The synchronization service broadcast the update through this response queue and this response queue will deliver the updated messages to each client and then these clients will update their respective files accordingly.
The message will never be lost even if the client will be disconnected from the internet (the benefit of using the messaging queue service).
---
3.8. Downloading Services:
Clients initiate file download requests through the client application. The Download Service queries the Metadata Database for file details. The server’s Download Service retrieves metadata from the Metadata Database. Metadata includes information such as file name, size, owner, and access permissions.

4. Low-Level Design(LLD) of Dropbox System Design
A lot of people assume designing a Dropbox is that all they just need to do is to use some cloud services, upload the file, and download the file whenever they want but that’s not how it works. The core problem is “Where and how to save the files? “. Suppose you want to share a file that can be of any size (small or big) and you upload it into the cloud.
---
4.5. Cloud Storage
You can use any cloud storage service like Amazon S3 to store the chunks of the files uploaded by the user. The client communicates with the cloud storage for any action performed in the files/folders using the API provided by the cloud provider.
---
Everything is fine till here but later if you have to make an update in your file then it’s not a good idea to edit the file and upload the whole file again and again into the cloud. The reason is:
---
The total number of users = 500 million.
Total number of daily active users = 100 million
The average number of files stored by each user = 200
The average size of each file = 100 KB
Total number of active connections per minute = 1 million

Storage Estimations:

Total number of files = 500 million * 200 = 100 billion
Total storage required = 100 billion * 100 KB = 10 PB


3. High-Level Design(HLD) of Dropbox System Design
HighLevelDesignOfdropBoxdrawio-(2)

3.1. User Uploading:
Users interact with the client application or web interface to initiate file uploads. The client application communicates with the Upload Service on the server side. Large files may be broken into smaller chunks for efficient transfer.
---
It maps database tables to application objects, providing a convenient way to interact with the database using programming language constructs.
ORM helps abstract away the intricacies of SQL queries and database schema, making it easier for developers to work with databases.
4.2.6 Edge Wrapper and ORM:
The edge wrapper integrates ORM functionality to provide a convenient interface for the application to interact with sharded databases.
---
3.4. S3 Bucket:
S3 serves as the scalable and durable storage backend. Presigned URLs allow clients to upload directly to S3, minimizing server involvement in the actual file transfer. The bucket structure may organize files based on user accounts and metadata.

3.5. Metadata Database:
Stores metadata associated with each file, including details like name, size, owner, access permissions, and timestamps. Enables quick retrieval of file details without accessing S3. Ensures that file metadata is consistent with the actual content in S3.
---
3.2. Upload Service:
Receives file upload requests from clients. Generates Presigned URLs for S3 to allow clients to upload directly. Coordinates the upload process, ensuring data integrity and completeness. After successful upload, it updates the Metadata Database with file details. Coordinates the upload process, breaking down large files into manageable chunks if necessary.

3.3. Getting Presigned URL:
The client application requests a Presigned URL from the Upload Service. The server generates the Presigned URL by interacting with the S3 service, creating a unique token for the specific upload operation. These URLs grant temporary, secure access to upload a specific file to a designated S3 bucket. Allows clients to bypass the server for direct communication with the storage layer.
---
3.6. Uploading to S3 using Presigned URL and Metadata:
The client uses the Presigned URL to upload the file directly to the designated S3 bucket. Metadata associated with the file, such as file name and owner, is included in the upload process. This ensures that the file’s metadata is synchronized with its corresponding data in S3.

3.7. Role of Task Runner:
After the file is successfully uploaded to S3, a task runner process is triggered. The task runner communicates with the Metadata Database to update or perform additional tasks related to the uploaded file. This may include updating file status, triggering indexing for search functionality, or sending notifications.",2.30628514289856,"No, there is no mention in the provided text about selecting the right hardware or VM instance types for energy-efficient AI/ML training.

7. Scalabilty for Dropbox System Design
Horizontal Scaling
We can add more servers behind the load balancer to increase the capacity of each service. This is known as Horizontal Scaling and each service can be independently scaled horizontally in our design.
Database Sharding
Metadata DB is sharded based on object_id. Our hash function will map each object_id to a random server where we can store the file/folder metadata. To query for a particular object_id, service can determine the database server using same hash function and query for data. This approach will distribute our database load to multiple servers making it scalable.
Cache Sharding

5. Database Design for Dropbox System Design
To understand Database design one should understand

Each user must have at-least one device.
Each device will have at-least one object (file or folder). Once user registers, we create a root folder for him/her making sure he/she has at-least one object.
Each object may have chunks. Only files can have chunk, folders can’t have chunks.
Each object may be shared with one or multiple users. This mapping is maintained in AccessControlList.
We need the following tables to store our data:

5.1 Users
Users

{
  user_id(PK)
  name
  email
  password
  last_login_at
  created_at
  updated_at
}
5.2 Devices
Devices

{
  device_id(PK)
  user_id(FK)
  created_at
  updated_at
}
5.3 Objects

More bandwidth and cloud space utilization:
To provide a history of the files you need to keep multiple versions of the files.
This requires more bandwidth and more space in the cloud. Even for the small changes in your file, you will have to back up and transfer the whole file into the cloud again and again which is not a good idea.
Latency or Concurrency Utilization:
You can’t do time optimization as well. It will consume more time to upload a single file as a whole even if you make small changes in your file.
It’s also not possible to make use of concurrency to upload/download the files using multi threads or multi processes.
Let’s discuss how we can solve this problem:
