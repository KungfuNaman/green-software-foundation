Is there any mention of minimizing the total number of deployed environments to save resources?,"Now, here comes the responsibility of the group service. The group service keeps all information about users in each group in the system. It has all the information about each group, including user IDs, group ID, status, group icon, number of users, and so on. This service resides on top of the MySQL database cluster, with multiple secondary replicas distributed geographically. A Redis cache server also exists to cache data from the MySQL servers. Both geographically distributed replicas and Redis cache aid in reducing latency.

The group message handler communicates with the group service to retrieve data of Group/A users. In the last step, the group message handler follows the same process as a WebSocket server and delivers the message to each user.

Non-functional Requirements

Approaches

Minimizing latency

Geographically distributed cache management systems and servers
CDNs
Consistency

Provide unique IDs to messages using Sequencer or other mechanisms
Use FIFO messaging queue with strict ordering
Availability

Provide multiple WebSocket servers and managers to establish connections between users
Replication of messages and data associated with users and groups on different servers
Follow disaster recovery protocols
Security

Via end-to-end encryption
Scalability

Performance tuning of servers
Horizontal scalability of services

---

For 30 days, the storage capacity would become the following:
30∗10 TB/day = 300 TB/month

---

Consistency: Messages should be delivered in the order they were sent.
Availability: The system should be highly available. However, the availability can be compromised in the interest of consistency.
Security: The system must be secure via end-to-end encryption. The end-to-end encryption ensures that only the two communicating parties can see the content of messages. Nobody in between, not even WhatsApp, should have access.
Scalability: The system should be highly scalable to support an ever-increasing number of users and messages per day.
Capacity Estimation
Storage Estimation:
100 billion messages are shared through WhatsApp per day and each message takes 100 bytes on average
100 billion/day∗100 Bytes = 10 TB/day
For 30 days, the storage capacity would become the following:

And, it exposes APIs to receive messages by various filters, such as user ID, message ID, and so on.

3. Send or receive media files
We have another service called the asset service, which is responsible for sending and receiving media files.

---

The media file is compressed and encrypted on the device side.
The compressed and encrypted file is sent to the asset service to store the file on blob storage.
The asset service assigns an ID that’s communicated with the sender. The asset service also maintains a hash for each file to avoid duplication of content on the blob storage.
For example, if a user wants to upload an image that’s already there in the blob storage, the image won’t be uploaded. Instead, the same ID is forwarded to the receiver.
The asset service sends the ID of media files to the receiver via the message service. The receiver downloads the media file from the blob storage using the ID.
The content is loaded onto a CDN if the asset service receives a large number of requests for some particular content.

The group message handler communicates with the group service to retrieve data of Group/A users. In the last step, the group message handler follows the same process as a WebSocket server and delivers the message to each user.

4. Support for Group messages
Since user A is connected to a WebSocket server, it sends a message to the message service intended for Group A.The message service sends the message to Kafka with other specific information about the group. The message is saved there for further processing. In Kafka terminology, a group can be a topic, and the senders and receivers can be producers and consumers, respectively.

Message service is a repository of messages on top of the Mnesia database cluster. It acts as an interface to the Mnesia database for other services interacting with the databases. It is responsible for storing and retrieving messages from the Mnesia database. It also deletes messages from the Mnesia database after a configurable amount of time. And, it exposes APIs to receive messages by various filters, such as user ID, message ID, and so on.

Is there any mention of deleting unused storage resources to remove storage that is no longer needed?,"Now, here comes the responsibility of the group service. The group service keeps all information about users in each group in the system. It has all the information about each group, including user IDs, group ID, status, group icon, number of users, and so on. This service resides on top of the MySQL database cluster, with multiple secondary replicas distributed geographically. A Redis cache server also exists to cache data from the MySQL servers. Both geographically distributed replicas and Redis cache aid in reducing latency.

The group message handler communicates with the group service to retrieve data of Group/A users. In the last step, the group message handler follows the same process as a WebSocket server and delivers the message to each user.

4. Support for Group messages
Since user A is connected to a WebSocket server, it sends a message to the message service intended for Group A.The message service sends the message to Kafka with other specific information about the group. The message is saved there for further processing. In Kafka terminology, a group can be a topic, and the senders and receivers can be producers and consumers, respectively.

Message service is a repository of messages on top of the Mnesia database cluster. It acts as an interface to the Mnesia database for other services interacting with the databases. It is responsible for storing and retrieving messages from the Mnesia database. It also deletes messages from the Mnesia database after a configurable amount of time. And, it exposes APIs to receive messages by various filters, such as user ID, message ID, and so on.

3. Send or receive media files
We have another service called the asset service, which is responsible for sending and receiving media files.

---

The media file is compressed and encrypted on the device side.
The compressed and encrypted file is sent to the asset service to store the file on blob storage.
The asset service assigns an ID that’s communicated with the sender. The asset service also maintains a hash for each file to avoid duplication of content on the blob storage.
For example, if a user wants to upload an image that’s already there in the blob storage, the image won’t be uploaded. Instead, the same ID is forwarded to the receiver.
The asset service sends the ID of media files to the receiver via the message service. The receiver downloads the media file from the blob storage using the ID.
The content is loaded onto a CDN if the asset service receives a large number of requests for some particular content.

Message service is a repository of messages on top of the Mnesia database cluster. It acts as an interface to the Mnesia database for other services interacting with the databases. It is responsible for storing and retrieving messages from the Mnesia database. It also deletes messages from the Mnesia database after a configurable amount of time. And, it exposes APIs to receive messages by various filters, such as user ID, message ID, and so on.

3. Send or receive media files
We have another service called the asset service, which is responsible for sending and receiving media files.

---

The media file is compressed and encrypted on the device side.
The compressed and encrypted file is sent to the asset service to store the file on blob storage.
The asset service assigns an ID that’s communicated with the sender. The asset service also maintains a hash for each file to avoid duplication of content on the blob storage.
For example, if a user wants to upload an image that’s already there in the blob storage, the image won’t be uploaded. Instead, the same ID is forwarded to the receiver.
The asset service sends the ID of media files to the receiver via the message service. The receiver downloads the media file from the blob storage using the ID.
The content is loaded onto a CDN if the asset service receives a large number of requests for some particular content.
