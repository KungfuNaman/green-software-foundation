In a microservice architecture, services should be independent of each other. For example, The video storage service would be decoupled from the service responsible for transcoding videos.

It includes a lot of powerful and flexible toolkits to display, monitor, and analyze the result.
Chukwe collects the events from different parts of the system and from Chukwe you can do monitoring and analysis or you can use the dashboard to view the events.
Chukwe writes the event in the Hadoop file sequence format (S3). After that Big Data team processes these S3 Hadoop files and writes Hive in Parquet data format.
This process is called batch processing which basically scans the whole data at the hourly or daily frequency.
To upload online events to EMR/S3, Chukwa also provide traffic to Kafka (the main gate in real-time data processing).

Chukwe collects the events from different parts of the system and from Chukwe you can do monitoring and analysis or you can use the dashboard to view the events.
Chukwe writes the event in the Hadoop file sequence format (S3). After that Big Data team processes these S3 Hadoop files and writes Hive in Parquet data format.
This process is called batch processing which basically scans the whole data at the hourly or daily frequency.
To upload online events to EMR/S3, Chukwa also provide traffic to Kafka (the main gate in real-time data processing).

For example:

If a customer is unable to play the video then the customer care executive will resolve this issue using elastic search. The playback team goes to the elastic search and searches for the user to know why the video is not playing on the user’s device.

They get to know all the information and events happening for that particular user. They get to know what caused the error in the video stream. Elastic search is also used by the admin to keep track of some information. It is also used to keep track of resource usage and to detect signup or login problems.

To upload online events to EMR/S3, Chukwa also provide traffic to Kafka (the main gate in real-time data processing).

Kafka is responsible for moving data from fronting Kafka to various sinks: S3, Elasticsearch, and secondary Kafka.
Routing of these messages is done using the Apache Samja framework.
Traffic sent by the Chukwe can be full or filtered streams so sometimes you may have to apply further filtering on the Kafka streams.
That is the reason we consider the router to take from one Kafka topic to a different Kafka topic.

Chukwe writes the event in the Hadoop file sequence format (S3). After that Big Data team processes these S3 Hadoop files and writes Hive in Parquet data format.

For example:

If a customer is unable to play the video then the customer care executive will resolve this issue using elastic search. The playback team goes to the elastic search and searches for the user to know why the video is not playing on the user’s device.

They get to know all the information and events happening for that particular user. They get to know what caused the error in the video stream.

Chukwe collects the events from different parts of the system and from Chukwe you can do monitoring and analysis or you can use the dashboard to view the events.
Chukwe writes the event in the Hadoop file sequence format (S3). After that Big Data team processes these S3 Hadoop files and writes Hive in Parquet data format.

If a customer is unable to play the video then the customer care executive will resolve this issue using elastic search. The playback team goes to the elastic search and searches for the user to know why the video is not playing on the user’s device.

They get to know all the information and events happening for that particular user. They get to know what caused the error in the video stream.

3.2. How Netflix balance the high traffic load
1. Elastic Load Balancer
elastic-load-balancer

ELB in Netflix is responsible for routing the traffic to front-end services. ELB performs a two-tier load-balancing scheme where the load is balanced over zones first and then instances (servers).

---

Client:
Device (User Interface) which is used to browse and play Netflix videos. TV, XBOX, laptop or mobile phone, etc
OC (Open Connect) or Netflix CDN:
CDN is the network of distributed servers in different geographical locations, and Open Connect is Netflix’s own custom global CDN (Content delivery network).
It handles everything which involves video streaming.
It is distributed in different locations and once you hit the play button the video stream from this component is displayed on your device.
So if you’re trying to play the video sitting in North America, the video will be served from the nearest open connect (or server) instead of the original server (faster response from the nearest server).

OC (Open Connect) or Netflix CDN:
CDN is the network of distributed servers in different geographical locations, and Open Connect is Netflix’s own custom global CDN (Content delivery network).
It handles everything which involves video streaming.
It is distributed in different locations and once you hit the play button the video stream from this component is displayed on your device.
So if you’re trying to play the video sitting in North America, the video will be served from the nearest open connect (or server) instead of the original server (faster response from the nearest server).

For example:

If a customer is unable to play the video then the customer care executive will resolve this issue using elastic search. The playback team goes to the elastic search and searches for the user to know why the video is not playing on the user’s device.

They get to know all the information and events happening for that particular user. They get to know what caused the error in the video stream. Elastic search is also used by the admin to keep track of some information. It is also used to keep track of resource usage and to detect signup or login problems.

If a customer is unable to play the video then the customer care executive will resolve this issue using elastic search. The playback team goes to the elastic search and searches for the user to know why the video is not playing on the user’s device.

They get to know all the information and events happening for that particular user. They get to know what caused the error in the video stream.

Client:
Device (User Interface) which is used to browse and play Netflix videos. TV, XBOX, laptop or mobile phone, etc
OC (Open Connect) or Netflix CDN:
CDN is the network of distributed servers in different geographical locations, and Open Connect is Netflix’s own custom global CDN (Content delivery network).
It handles everything which involves video streaming.
It is distributed in different locations and once you hit the play button the video stream from this component is displayed on your device.
So if you’re trying to play the video sitting in North America, the video will be served from the nearest open connect (or server) instead of the original server (faster response from the nearest server).

3.2. How Netflix balance the high traffic load
1. Elastic Load Balancer
elastic-load-balancer

ELB in Netflix is responsible for routing the traffic to front-end services. ELB performs a two-tier load-balancing scheme where the load is balanced over zones first and then instances (servers).

2.1. Microservices Architecture of Netflix 
Netflix’s architectural style is built as a collection of services. This is known as microservices architecture and this power all of the APIs needed for applications and Web apps. When the request arrives at the endpoint it calls the other microservices for required data and these microservices can also request the data from different microservices. After that, a complete response for the API request is sent back to the endpoint.

For example:

If a customer is unable to play the video then the customer care executive will resolve this issue using elastic search. The playback team goes to the elastic search and searches for the user to know why the video is not playing on the user’s device.

They get to know all the information and events happening for that particular user. They get to know what caused the error in the video stream. Elastic search is also used by the admin to keep track of some information. It is also used to keep track of resource usage and to detect signup or login problems.
