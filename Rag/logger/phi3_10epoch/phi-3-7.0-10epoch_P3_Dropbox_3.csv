Let’s assume we have a client installed on our computer (an app installed on your computer) and this client has 4 basic components. These basic components are Watcher, Chunker, Indexer, and Internal DB. We have considered only one client but there can be multiple clients belonging to the same user with the same basic components.

We are creating n number of response queues for n number of clients because the message will be deleted from the queue once it will be received by the client and we need to share the updated message with the various subscribed clients.
4.4. Synchronization Service
The client communicates with the synchronization services either to receive the latest update from the cloud storage or to send the latest request/updates to the Cloud Storage.

We can break the files into multiple chunks to overcome the problem we discussed above. There is no need to upload/download the whole single file after making any changes in the file.

You just need to save the chunk which is updated (this will take less memory and time). It will be easier to keep the different versions of the files in various chunks.
We have considered one file which is divided into various chunks. If there are multiple files then we need to know which chunks belong to which file.
To keep this information we will create one more file named a metadata file. This file contains the indexes of the chunks (chunk names and order information).

It gives a notification to the indexer and chunker if any action is performed in the files or folders.
Chunker breaks the files into multiple small pieces called chunks and uploads them to the cloud storage with a unique id or hash of these chunks.
To recreate the files these chunks can be joined together. For any changes in the files, the chunking algorithm detects the specific chunk which is modified and only saves that specific part/chunk to the cloud storage.
It reduces bandwidth usage, synchronization time, and storage space in the cloud.
Indexer is responsible for updating the internal database when it receives the notification from the watcher (for any action performed in folders/files).

We have considered one file which is divided into various chunks. If there are multiple files then we need to know which chunks belong to which file.

Is there any mention of queuing non-urgent processing requests,"7. Scalabilty for Dropbox System Design
Horizontal Scaling
We can add more servers behind the load balancer to increase the capacity of each service. This is known as Horizontal Scaling and each service can be independently scaled horizontally in our design.
Database Sharding
Metadata DB is sharded based on object_id. Our hash function will map each object_id to a random server where we can store the file/folder metadata. To query for a particular object_id, service can determine the database server using same hash function and query for data. This approach will distribute our database load to multiple servers making it scalable.

It gives a notification to the indexer and chunker if any action is performed in the files or folders.
Chunker breaks the files into multiple small pieces called chunks and uploads them to the cloud storage with a unique id or hash of these chunks.
To recreate the files these chunks can be joined together. For any changes in the files, the chunking algorithm detects the specific chunk which is modified and only saves that specific part/chunk to the cloud storage.
It reduces bandwidth usage, synchronization time, and storage space in the cloud.
Indexer is responsible for updating the internal database when it receives the notification from the watcher (for any action performed in folders/files).

It handles tasks like routing queries to the appropriate shard, managing transactions across shards, and abstracting the underlying complexities of database sharding.
ORM, within the edge wrapper, enables the application to interact with the database using high-level programming constructs, reducing the need for developers to write complex SQL queries.
This combination of edge wrapper and ORM simplifies database management, making it easier to scale the application horizontally with sharded databases while maintaining a cohesive and developer-friendly interface.

You just need to save the chunk which is updated (this will take less memory and time). It will be easier to keep the different versions of the files in various chunks.
We have considered one file which is divided into various chunks. If there are multiple files then we need to know which chunks belong to which file.
To keep this information we will create one more file named a metadata file. This file contains the indexes of the chunks (chunk names and order information).
You need to mention the hash of the chunks (or some reference) in this metadata file and you need to sync this file into the cloud. We can download the metadata file from the cloud whenever we want and we can recreate the file using various chunks.

This will be a global request queue shared among all the clients.
Whenever a client receives any update or changes in the files/folder it sends the request through the request queue.
This request is received by the synchronization service to update the metadata database.
Response Queue:
There will be an individual response queue corresponding to the individual clients.
The synchronization service broadcast the update through this response queue and this response queue will deliver the updated messages to each client and then these clients will update their respective files accordingly.
The message will never be lost even if the client will be disconnected from the internet (the benefit of using the messaging queue service).

Chunker breaks the files into multiple small pieces called chunks and uploads them to the cloud storage with a unique id or hash of these chunks.
To recreate the files these chunks can be joined together. For any changes in the files, the chunking algorithm detects the specific chunk which is modified and only saves that specific part/chunk to the cloud storage.

Respond strictly in this format: 'Judgment: Yes or No.' Justify your response briefly within three sentences limiting its scope to whether cloud-native VMs are specifically employed for each service instance as mentioned in the documentation excerpt provided below.
--- Architectural Document Excerpt -- Begin-- 12 microservices form our core application, structured around a shared database and stateless services with individual load balancers attached per service to ensure optimal resource utilization while maintaining high availability across different regions by leveraging cloud-native VMs. Each of these instances is independently scalable horizontally using Kubernetes for orchestration within the Azure platform, ensuring seamless scaling and management without dedicated single servers or non-cloud infrastructure resources that limit flexibility in deployment scenarios.-- Architectural Document Excerpt -- End--

### Solution 1 - Similar Difficulty Level Response
Judgment: Yes. The document mentions that microservices have independent load balancers and are designed for optimal resource utilization, with each service instance managed independently on Azure to ensure high availability across regions using cloud-native VMs. This setup allows seamless scaling through Kubernetes orchestration without the constraints of non-cloud infrastructure resources or single servers that may hamper deployment flexibility.

You just need to save the chunk which is updated (this will take less memory and time). It will be easier to keep the different versions of the files in various chunks.
We have considered one file which is divided into various chunks. If there are multiple files then we need to know which chunks belong to which file.
To keep this information we will create one more file named a metadata file. This file contains the indexes of the chunks (chunk names and order information).
You need to mention the hash of the chunks (or some reference) in this metadata file and you need to sync this file into the cloud. We can download the metadata file from the cloud whenever we want and we can recreate the file using various chunks.",5.320051908493042," Judgement: No

Chunker breaks the files into multiple small pieces called chunks and uploads them to the cloud storage with a unique id or hash of these chunks.
To recreate the files these chunks can be joined together. For any changes in the files, the chunking algorithm detects the specific chunk which is modified and only saves that specific part/chunk to the cloud storage.
It reduces bandwidth usage, synchronization time, and storage space in the cloud.
Indexer is responsible for updating the internal database when it receives the notification from the watcher (for any action performed in folders/files).
