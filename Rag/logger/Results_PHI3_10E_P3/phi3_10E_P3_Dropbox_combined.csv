Is there any mention of minimizing the total number of deployed environments?,"Request Queue:
This will be a global request queue shared among all the clients.
Whenever a client receives any update or changes in the files/folder it sends the request through the request queue.
This request is received by the synchronization service to update the metadata database.
Response Queue:
There will be an individual response queue corresponding to the individual clients.
The synchronization service broadcast the update through this response queue and this response queue will deliver the updated messages to each client and then these clients will update their respective files accordingly.
The message will never be lost even if the client will be disconnected from the internet (the benefit of using the messaging queue service).

---

We are creating n number of response queues for n number of clients because the message will be deleted from the queue once it will be received by the client and we need to share the updated message with the various subscribed clients.
4.4. Synchronization Service
The client communicates with the synchronization services either to receive the latest update from the cloud storage or to send the latest request/updates to the Cloud Storage.

It gives a notification to the indexer and chunker if any action is performed in the files or folders.
Chunker breaks the files into multiple small pieces called chunks and uploads them to the cloud storage with a unique id or hash of these chunks.
To recreate the files these chunks can be joined together. For any changes in the files, the chunking algorithm detects the specific chunk which is modified and only saves that specific part/chunk to the cloud storage.
It reduces bandwidth usage, synchronization time, and storage space in the cloud.
Indexer is responsible for updating the internal database when it receives the notification from the watcher (for any action performed in folders/files).

Horizontal Scaling
We can add more servers behind the load balancer to increase the capacity of each service. This is known as Horizontal Scaling and each service can be independently scaled horizontally in our design.
Database Sharding
Metadata DB is sharded based on object_id. Our hash function will map each object_id to a random server where we can store the file/folder metadata. To query for a particular object_id, service can determine the database server using same hash function and query for data. This approach will distribute our database load to multiple servers making it scalable.

It gives a notification to the indexer and chunker if any action is performed in the files or folders.
Chunker breaks the files into multiple small pieces called chunks and uploads them to the cloud storage with a unique id or hash of these chunks.
To recreate the files these chunks can be joined together. For any changes in the files, the chunking algorithm detects the specific chunk which is modified and only saves that specific part/chunk to the cloud storage.
It reduces bandwidth usage, synchronization time, and storage space in the cloud.
Indexer is responsible for updating the internal database when it receives the notification from the watcher (for any action performed in folders/files).

It handles tasks like routing queries to the appropriate shard, managing transactions across shards, and abstracting the underlying complexities of database sharding.
ORM, within the edge wrapper, enables the application to interact with the database using high-level programming constructs, reducing the need for developers to write complex SQL queries.
This combination of edge wrapper and ORM simplifies database management, making it easier to scale the application horizontally with sharded databases while maintaining a cohesive and developer-friendly interface.

You just need to save the chunk which is updated (this will take less memory and time). It will be easier to keep the different versions of the files in various chunks.
We have considered one file which is divided into various chunks. If there are multiple files then we need to know which chunks belong to which file.
To keep this information we will create one more file named a metadata file. This file contains the indexes of the chunks (chunk names and order information).
You need to mention the hash of the chunks (or some reference) in this metadata file and you need to sync this file into the cloud.

Chunker breaks the files into multiple small pieces called chunks and uploads them to the cloud storage with a unique id or hash of these chunks.

3.8. Downloading Services:
Clients initiate file download requests through the client application. The Download Service queries the Metadata Database for file details. The server’s Download Service retrieves metadata from the Metadata Database. Metadata includes information such as file name, size, owner, and access permissions.

4. Low-Level Design(LLD) of Dropbox System Design
A lot of people assume designing a Dropbox is that all they just need to do is to use some cloud services, upload the file, and download the file whenever they want but that’s not how it works. The core problem is “Where and how to save the files? “. Suppose you want to share a file that can be of any size (small or big) and you upload it into the cloud.

Cache Sharding
Similar to Metadata DB Sharding, we are distributing the cache to multiple servers. In-fact Redis has out of box support for partitioning the data across multiple Redis instances. Usage of Consistent Hashing for distributing data across instances ensures that load is equally distributed if one instance goes away.

These basic components are Watcher, Chunker, Indexer, and Internal DB. We have considered only one client but there can be multiple clients belonging to the same user with the same basic components.

---

Request Queue:
This will be a global request queue shared among all the clients.
Whenever a client receives any update or changes in the files/folder it sends the request through the request queue.
This request is received by the synchronization service to update the metadata database.
Response Queue:
There will be an individual response queue corresponding to the individual clients.
The synchronization service broadcast the update through this response queue and this response queue will deliver the updated messages to each client and then these clients will update their respective files accordingly.
The message will never be lost even if the client will be disconnected from the internet (the benefit of using the messaging queue service).

It gives a notification to the indexer and chunker if any action is performed in the files or folders.
Chunker breaks the files into multiple small pieces called chunks and uploads them to the cloud storage with a unique id or hash of these chunks.
To recreate the files these chunks can be joined together. For any changes in the files, the chunking algorithm detects the specific chunk which is modified and only saves that specific part/chunk to the cloud storage.
It reduces bandwidth usage, synchronization time, and storage space in the cloud.
Indexer is responsible for updating the internal database when it receives the notification from the watcher (for any action performed in folders/files).

**<|user|> ** Your task is to critically evaluate the software engineering practices detailed in this context. Construct a brief response using only ""Yes"" or ""No,"" following these guidelines strictly: No other explanations allowed. Is there any indication of adopting microservices architecture? Answer with Yes/no.

**Context:**

4.4. Synchronization Service
The client communicates with the synchronization services either to receive the latest update from the cloud storage or to send the latest request/updates to the Cloud Storage.

---

Request Queue:
This will be a global request queue shared among all the clients.
Whenever a client receives any update or changes in the files/folder it sends the request through the request queue.
This request is received by the synchronization service to update the metadata database.
Response Queue:
There will be an individual response queue corresponding to the individual clients.
The synchronization service broadcast the update through this response queue and this response queue will deliver the updated messages to each client and then these clients will update their respective files accordingly.
The message will never be lost even if the client will be disconnected from the internet (the benefit of using the messaging queue service).

We can break the files into multiple chunks to overcome the problem we discussed above. There is no need to upload/download the whole single file after making any changes in the file.

You just need to save the chunk which is updated (this will take less memory and time). It will be easier to keep the different versions of the files in various chunks.
We have considered one file which is divided into various chunks. If there are multiple files then we need to know which chunks belong to which file.
To keep this information we will create one more file named a metadata file. This file contains the indexes of the chunks (chunk names and order information).
You need to mention the hash of the chunks (or some reference) in this metadata file and you need to sync this file into the cloud. We can download the metadata file from the cloud whenever we want and we can recreate the file using various chunks.

Chunker breaks the files into multiple small pieces called chunks and uploads them to the cloud storage with a unique id or hash of these chunks.
To recreate the files these chunks can be joined together. For any changes in the files, the chunking algorithm detects the specific chunk which is modified and only saves that specific part/chunk to the cloud storage.

Durability: Durability means the data uploaded by the user should be permanently stored in the database even in case of database failure. Our System should ensure the files uploaded by the user should be permanently stored on the drive without any data loss.
Reliability: Reliability means how many times the system gives the expected output for the same input.

We are creating n number of response queues for n number of clients because the message will be deleted from the queue once it will be received by the client and we need to share the updated message with the various subscribed clients.
4.4. Synchronization Service
The client communicates with the synchronization services either to receive the latest update from the cloud storage or to send the latest request/updates to the Cloud Storage.

---

Request Queue:
This will be a global request queue shared among all the clients.
Whenever a client receives any update or changes in the files/folder it sends the request through the request queue.
This request is received by the synchronization service to update the metadata database.
Response Queue:
There will be an individual response queue corresponding to the individual clients.
The synchronization service broadcast the update through this response queue and this response queue will deliver the updated messages to each client and then these clients will update their respective files accordingly.
The message will never be lost even if the client will be disconnected from the internet (the benefit of using the messaging queue service).

Chunker breaks the files into multiple small pieces called chunks and uploads them to the cloud storage with a unique id or hash of these chunks.
To recreate the files these chunks can be joined together. For any changes in the files, the chunking algorithm detects the specific chunk which is modified and only saves that specific part/chunk to the cloud storage.

It maps database tables to application objects, providing a convenient way to interact with the database using programming language constructs.
ORM helps abstract away the intricacies of SQL queries and database schema, making it easier for developers to work with databases.
4.2.6 Edge Wrapper and ORM:
The edge wrapper integrates ORM functionality to provide a convenient interface for the application to interact with sharded databases.

---

It acts as an intermediary, providing a unified interface for the application to interact with the database system.
The edge wrapper encapsulates the complexities of managing multiple shards and provides a simplified interface to the application.
4.2.5 Object-Relational Mapping (ORM):
ORM is a programming technique that allows data to be seamlessly converted between the relational database format and the application’s object-oriented format.

It gives a notification to the indexer and chunker if any action is performed in the files or folders.
Chunker breaks the files into multiple small pieces called chunks and uploads them to the cloud storage with a unique id or hash of these chunks.
To recreate the files these chunks can be joined together. For any changes in the files, the chunking algorithm detects the specific chunk which is modified and only saves that specific part/chunk to the cloud storage.
It reduces bandwidth usage, synchronization time, and storage space in the cloud.
Indexer is responsible for updating the internal database when it receives the notification from the watcher (for any action performed in folders/files).",8.505355596542358," Judgement: No.

Is there any mention of selecting the right hardware or VM instance types?,"4.5. Cloud Storage
You can use any cloud storage service like Amazon S3 to store the chunks of the files uploaded by the user. The client communicates with the cloud storage for any action performed in the files/folders using the API provided by the cloud provider.

We can break the files into multiple chunks to overcome the problem we discussed above. There is no need to upload/download the whole single file after making any changes in the file.

---

We are creating n number of response queues for n number of clients because the message will be deleted from the queue once it will be received by the client and we need to share the updated message with the various subscribed clients.
4.4. Synchronization Service
The client communicates with the synchronization services either to receive the latest update from the cloud storage or to send the latest request/updates to the Cloud Storage.

Let’s assume we have a client installed on our computer (an app installed on your computer) and this client has 4 basic components. These basic components are Watcher, Chunker, Indexer, and Internal DB. We have considered only one client but there can be multiple clients belonging to the same user with the same basic components.
