ev-cache

To solve this problem Netflix has built its own custom caching layer called EV cache. EV cache is based on Memcached and it is actually a wrapper around Memcached. 

Netflix has deployed a lot of clusters in a number of AWS EC2 instances and these clusters have so many nodes of Memcached and they also have cache clients.

mysql

All the read queries are redirected to the read replicas and only the write queries are redirected to the master nodes.

In the case of a primary master MySQL failure, the secondary master node will take over the primary role, and the route53 (DNS configuration) entry for the database will be changed to this new primary node.
This will also redirect the write queries to this new primary master node.  
4.2. Cassandra
Cassandra is a NoSQL database that can handle large amounts of data and it can also handle heavy writing and reading. When Netflix started acquiring more users, the viewing history data for each member also started increasing. This increases the total number of viewing history data and it becomes challenging for Netflix to handle this massive amount of data.

Treat Servers as Stateless:
To understand this concept think of your servers like a herd of cows and you care about how many gallons of milk you get every day.
If one day you notice that you’re getting less milk from a cow then you just need to replace that cow (producing less milk) with another cow.
You don’t need to be dependent on a specific cow to get the required amount of milk. We can relate the above example to our application.
The idea is to design the service in such a way that if one of the endpoints is giving the error or if it’s not serving the request in a timely fashion then you can switch to another server and get your work done.

3.2. How Netflix balance the high traffic load
1. Elastic Load Balancer
elastic-load-balancer

ELB in Netflix is responsible for routing the traffic to front-end services. ELB performs a two-tier load-balancing scheme where the load is balanced over zones first and then instances (servers).

---

It includes a lot of powerful and flexible toolkits to display, monitor, and analyze the result.
Chukwe collects the events from different parts of the system and from Chukwe you can do monitoring and analysis or you can use the dashboard to view the events.
Chukwe writes the event in the Hadoop file sequence format (S3). After that Big Data team processes these S3 Hadoop files and writes Hive in Parquet data format.
This process is called batch processing which basically scans the whole data at the hourly or daily frequency.
To upload online events to EMR/S3, Chukwa also provide traffic to Kafka (the main gate in real-time data processing).

Netflix uses Kafka and Apache Chukwe to ingest the data which is produced in a different part of the system. Netflix provides almost 500B data events that consume 1.3 PB/day and 8 million events that consume 24 GB/Second during peak time. These events include information like:

Error logs
UI activities
Performance events
Video viewing activities
Troubleshooting and diagnostic events.
Apache Chukwe is an open-source data collection system for collecting logs or events from a distributed system. It is built on top of HDFS and Map-reduce framework. It comes with Hadoop’s scalability and robustness features.

---

The data is shared across the cluster within the same zone and multiple copies of the cache are stored in sharded nodes.
Every time when write happens to the client all the nodes in all the clusters are updated but when the read happens to the cache, it is only sent to the nearest cluster (not all the cluster and nodes) and its nodes.
In case, a node is not available then read from a different available node. This approach increases performance, availability, and reliability.  
3.4. Data Processing in Netflix Using Kafka And Apache Chukwa
When you click on a video Netflix starts processing data in various terms and it takes less than a nanosecond. Let’s discuss how the evolution pipeline works on Netflix.

An outbound filter is used for zipping the content, calculating the metrics, or adding/removing custom headers. After that, the response is sent back to the Netty server and then it is received by the client.

When you load the front page you see multiple rows of different kinds of movies. Netflix personalizes this data and decides what kind of rows or what kind of movies should be displayed to a specific user. This data is based on the user’s historical data and preferences.

Also, for that specific user, Netflix performs sorting of the movies and calculates the relevance ranking (for the recommendation) of these movies available on their platform. In Netflix, Apache Spark is used for content recommendations and personalization.

3.2. How Netflix balance the high traffic load
1. Elastic Load Balancer
elastic-load-balancer

ELB in Netflix is responsible for routing the traffic to front-end services. ELB performs a two-tier load-balancing scheme where the load is balanced over zones first and then instances (servers).

---

Netflix uses Kafka and Apache Chukwe to ingest the data which is produced in a different part of the system. Netflix provides almost 500B data events that consume 1.3 PB/day and 8 million events that consume 24 GB/Second during peak time. These events include information like:

Error logs
UI activities
Performance events
Video viewing activities
Troubleshooting and diagnostic events.
Apache Chukwe is an open-source data collection system for collecting logs or events from a distributed system. It is built on top of HDFS and Map-reduce framework. It comes with Hadoop’s scalability and robustness features.

When you load the front page you see multiple rows of different kinds of movies. Netflix personalizes this data and decides what kind of rows or what kind of movies should be displayed to a specific user. This data is based on the user’s historical data and preferences.

Also, for that specific user, Netflix performs sorting of the movies and calculates the relevance ranking (for the recommendation) of these movies available on their platform. In Netflix, Apache Spark is used for content recommendations and personalization.

A majority of the machine learning pipelines are run on these large spark clusters. These pipelines are then used to do row selection, sorting, title relevance ranking, and artwork personalization among others.

If one day you notice that you’re getting less milk from a cow then you just need to replace that cow (producing less milk) with another cow.

Netflix has deployed a lot of clusters in a number of AWS EC2 instances and these clusters have so many nodes of Memcached and they also have cache clients.

---

The data is shared across the cluster within the same zone and multiple copies of the cache are stored in sharded nodes.
Every time when write happens to the client all the nodes in all the clusters are updated but when the read happens to the cache, it is only sent to the nearest cluster (not all the cluster and nodes) and its nodes.
In case, a node is not available then read from a different available node. This approach increases performance, availability, and reliability.

Is there any mention of queuing non-urgent processing requests,"How to make microservice architecture reliable? 
Use Hystrix (Already explained above)
Separate Critical Microservices:
We can separate out some critical services (or endpoint or APIs) and make it less dependent or independent of other services.
You can also make some critical services dependent only on other reliable services.
While choosing the critical microservices you can include all the basic functionalities, like searching for a video, navigating to the videos, hitting and playing the video, etc.
This way you can make the endpoints highly available and even in worst-case scenarios at least a user will be able to do the basic things.
Treat Servers as Stateless:

---

These replicas require a lot of transcoding and preprocessing. Netflix breaks the original video into different smaller chunks and using parallel workers in AWS it converts these chunks into different formats (like mp4, 3gp, etc) across different resolutions (like 4k, 1080p, and more). After transcoding, once we have multiple copies of the files for the same movie, these files are transferred to each and every Open Connect server which is placed in different locations across the world. 

Below is the step by step process of how Netflix ensures optimal streaming quality:

The idea is to design the service in such a way that if one of the endpoints is giving the error or if it’s not serving the request in a timely fashion then you can switch to another server and get your work done.

The data is shared across the cluster within the same zone and multiple copies of the cache are stored in sharded nodes.
Every time when write happens to the client all the nodes in all the clusters are updated but when the read happens to the cache, it is only sent to the nearest cluster (not all the cluster and nodes) and its nodes.
In case, a node is not available then read from a different available node. This approach increases performance, availability, and reliability.  
3.4. Data Processing in Netflix Using Kafka And Apache Chukwa
When you click on a video Netflix starts processing data in various terms and it takes less than a nanosecond. Let’s discuss how the evolution pipeline works on Netflix.

---

Netflix uses Kafka and Apache Chukwe to ingest the data which is produced in a different part of the system. Netflix provides almost 500B data events that consume 1.3 PB/day and 8 million events that consume 24 GB/Second during peak time. These events include information like:

Error logs
UI activities
Performance events
Video viewing activities
Troubleshooting and diagnostic events.
Apache Chukwe is an open-source data collection system for collecting logs or events from a distributed system. It is built on top of HDFS and Map-reduce framework. It comes with Hadoop’s scalability and robustness features.

Now, there is a good chance that the other person will also have a similar pattern and he/she will do the same thing that the first person has done. 
Content-based filtering:
The idea is to filter those videos which are similar to the video a user has liked before.
Content-based filtering is highly dependent on the information from the products such as movie title, release year, actors, the genre.
So to implement this filtering it’s important to know the information describing each item and some sort of user profile describing what the user likes is also desirable.  
4. Database Design of Netflix System Design
Netflix uses two different databases i.e. MySQL(RDBMS) and Cassandra(NoSQL) for different purposes.

---

mysql

All the read queries are redirected to the read replicas and only the write queries are redirected to the master nodes.

In the case of a primary master MySQL failure, the secondary master node will take over the primary role, and the route53 (DNS configuration) entry for the database will be changed to this new primary node.
This will also redirect the write queries to this new primary master node.  
4.2. Cassandra
Cassandra is a NoSQL database that can handle large amounts of data and it can also handle heavy writing and reading.

These replicas require a lot of transcoding and preprocessing. Netflix breaks the original video into different smaller chunks and using parallel workers in AWS it converts these chunks into different formats (like mp4, 3gp, etc) across different resolutions (like 4k, 1080p, and more). After transcoding, once we have multiple copies of the files for the same movie, these files are transferred to each and every Open Connect server which is placed in different locations across the world.

Content-based filtering:
The idea is to filter those videos which are similar to the video a user has liked before.
Content-based filtering is highly dependent on the information from the products such as movie title, release year, actors, the genre.
So to implement this filtering it’s important to know the information describing each item and some sort of user profile describing what the user likes is also desirable.

Error logs
UI activities
Performance events

The data is shared across the cluster within the same zone and multiple copies of the cache are stored in sharded nodes.
Every time when write happens to the client all the nodes in all the clusters are updated but when the read happens to the cache, it is only sent to the nearest cluster (not all the cluster and nodes) and its nodes.
In case, a node is not available then read from a different available node. This approach increases performance, availability, and reliability.

Netflix has deployed a lot of clusters in a number of AWS EC2 instances and these clusters have so many nodes of Memcached and they also have cache clients.

The data is shared across the cluster within the same zone and multiple copies of the cache are stored in sharded nodes.
Every time when write happens to the client all the nodes in all the clusters are updated but when the read happens to the cache, it is only sent to the nearest cluster (not all the cluster and nodes) and its nodes.

Chukwe collects the events from different parts of the system and from Chukwe you can do monitoring and analysis or you can use the dashboard to view the events.
Chukwe writes the event in the Hadoop file sequence format (S3). After that Big Data team processes these S3 Hadoop files and writes Hive in Parquet data format.
This process is called batch processing which basically scans the whole data at the hourly or daily frequency.
To upload online events to EMR/S3, Chukwa also provide traffic to Kafka (the main gate in real-time data processing).

Content-based filtering:
The idea is to filter those videos which are similar to the video a user has liked before.
Content-based filtering is highly dependent on the information from the products such as movie title, release year, actors, the genre.
So to implement this filtering it’s important to know the information describing each item and some sort of user profile describing what the user likes is also desirable.

ev-cache

To solve this problem Netflix has built its own custom caching layer called EV cache. EV cache is based on Memcached and it is actually a wrapper around Memcached. 

Netflix has deployed a lot of clusters in a number of AWS EC2 instances and these clusters have so many nodes of Memcached and they also have cache clients.

---

It includes a lot of powerful and flexible toolkits to display, monitor, and analyze the result.
Chukwe collects the events from different parts of the system and from Chukwe you can do monitoring and analysis or you can use the dashboard to view the events.
Chukwe writes the event in the Hadoop file sequence format (S3). After that Big Data team processes these S3 Hadoop files and writes Hive in Parquet data format.
This process is called batch processing which basically scans the whole data at the hourly or daily frequency.
To upload online events to EMR/S3, Chukwa also provide traffic to Kafka (the main gate in real-time data processing).

---

These replicas require a lot of transcoding and preprocessing. Netflix breaks the original video into different smaller chunks and using parallel workers in AWS it converts these chunks into different formats (like mp4, 3gp, etc) across different resolutions (like 4k, 1080p, and more).

mysql

All the read queries are redirected to the read replicas and only the write queries are redirected to the master nodes.

In the case of a primary master MySQL failure, the secondary master node will take over the primary role, and the route53 (DNS configuration) entry for the database will be changed to this new primary node.
This will also redirect the write queries to this new primary master node.  
4.2. Cassandra
Cassandra is a NoSQL database that can handle large amounts of data and it can also handle heavy writing and reading. When Netflix started acquiring more users, the viewing history data for each member also started increasing. This increases the total number of viewing history data and it becomes challenging for Netflix to handle this massive amount of data.

Treat Servers as Stateless:
To understand this concept think of your servers like a herd of cows and you care about how many gallons of milk you get every day.
If one day you notice that you’re getting less milk from a cow then you just need to replace that cow (producing less milk) with another cow.
You don’t need to be dependent on a specific cow to get the required amount of milk. We can relate the above example to our application.
The idea is to design the service in such a way that if one of the endpoints is giving the error or if it’s not serving the request in a timely fashion then you can switch to another server and get your work done.

When the user loads the Netflix app on his/her device firstly AWS instances come into the picture and handle some tasks such as login, recommendations, search, user history, the home page, billing, customer support, etc.
After that, when the user hits the play button on a video, Netflix analyzes the network speed or connection stability, and then it figures out the best Open Connect server near to the user.
Depending on the device and screen size, the right video format is streamed into the user’s device. While watching a video, you might have noticed that the video appears pixelated and snaps back to HD after a while.

When you load the front page you see multiple rows of different kinds of movies. Netflix personalizes this data and decides what kind of rows or what kind of movies should be displayed to a specific user. This data is based on the user’s historical data and preferences.

Also, for that specific user, Netflix performs sorting of the movies and calculates the relevance ranking (for the recommendation) of these movies available on their platform. In Netflix, Apache Spark is used for content recommendations and personalization.

A majority of the machine learning pipelines are run on these large spark clusters. These pipelines are then used to do row selection, sorting, title relevance ranking, and artwork personalization among others.

The data is shared across the cluster within the same zone and multiple copies of the cache are stored in sharded nodes.
Every time when write happens to the client all the nodes in all the clusters are updated but when the read happens to the cache, it is only sent to the nearest cluster (not all the cluster and nodes) and its nodes.
In case, a node is not available then read from a different available node. This approach increases performance, availability, and reliability.

For example:

If a customer is unable to play the video then the customer care executive will resolve this issue using elastic search. The playback team goes to the elastic search and searches for the user to know why the video is not playing on the user’s device.

They get to know all the information and events happening for that particular user. They get to know what caused the error in the video stream. Elastic search is also used by the admin to keep track of some information. It is also used to keep track of resource usage and to detect signup or login problems.

Content-based filtering is highly dependent on the information from the products such as movie title, release year, actors, the genre.
So to implement this filtering it’s important to know the information describing each item and some sort of user profile describing what the user likes is also desirable.

Is there any mention of training AI models in cloud regions with lower carbon intensity?,"Treat Servers as Stateless:
To understand this concept think of your servers like a herd of cows and you care about how many gallons of milk you get every day.
If one day you notice that you’re getting less milk from a cow then you just need to replace that cow (producing less milk) with another cow.
You don’t need to be dependent on a specific cow to get the required amount of milk. We can relate the above example to our application.
The idea is to design the service in such a way that if one of the endpoints is giving the error or if it’s not serving the request in a timely fashion then you can switch to another server and get your work done.

3.1. How Does Netflix Onboard a Movie/Video?

---

The Netty server takes responsibility to handle the network protocol, web server, connection management, and proxying work. When the request will hit the Netty server, it will proxy the request to the inbound filter.
The inbound filter is responsible for authentication, routing, or decorating the request. Then it forwards the request to the endpoint filter.
The endpoint filter is used to return a static response or to forward the request to the backend service (or origin as we call it).
Once it receives the response from the backend service, it sends the request to the outbound filter.

These replicas require a lot of transcoding and preprocessing. Netflix breaks the original video into different smaller chunks and using parallel workers in AWS it converts these chunks into different formats (like mp4, 3gp, etc) across different resolutions (like 4k, 1080p, and more). After transcoding, once we have multiple copies of the files for the same movie, these files are transferred to each and every Open Connect server which is placed in different locations across the world. 

Below is the step by step process of how Netflix ensures optimal streaming quality:

When the user loads the Netflix app on his/her device firstly AWS instances come into the picture and handle some tasks such as login, recommendations, search, user history, the home page, billing, customer support, etc.
After that, when the user hits the play button on a video, Netflix analyzes the network speed or connection stability, and then it figures out the best Open Connect server near to the user.
