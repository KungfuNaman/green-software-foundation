1. Connection with Websocket Server
In WhatsApp, each active device is connected with a WebSocket server via WebSocket protocol. A WebSocket server keeps the connection open with all the active (online) users. Since one server isn’t enough to handle billions of devices, there should be enough servers to handle billions of users.

---

For 30 days, the storage capacity would become the following:
30∗10 TB/day = 300 TB/month

---

Functional Requirement
Conversation: The system should support one-on-one and group conversations between users.
Acknowledgment: The system should support message delivery acknowledgment, such as sent, delivered, and read.
Sharing: The system should support sharing of media files, such as images, videos, and audio.
Chat storage: The system must support the persistent storage of chat messages when a user is offline until the successful delivery of messages.
Push notifications: The system should be able to notify offline users of new messages once their status becomes online.
Non-Functional Requirement
Low latency: Users should be able to receive messages with low latency.
Consistency: Messages should be delivered in the order they were sent.

---

Bandwidth Estimation:
According to the storage capacity estimation, our service will get 10TB of data each day, giving us a bandwidth of 926 Mb/s.
10 TB/86400sec ≈ 926Mb/s

Number of servers estimation:
WhatsApp handles around 10 million connections on a single server, which seems quite high for a server.
No. of servers = Total connections per day/No. of connections per server = 2 billion/10 million = 200 servers

1. Connection with Websocket Server
In WhatsApp, each active device is connected with a WebSocket server via WebSocket protocol. A WebSocket server keeps the connection open with all the active (online) users. Since one server isn’t enough to handle billions of devices, there should be enough servers to handle billions of users.

---

For 30 days, the storage capacity would become the following:
30∗10 TB/day = 300 TB/month

---

Bandwidth Estimation:
According to the storage capacity estimation, our service will get 10TB of data each day, giving us a bandwidth of 926 Mb/s.
10 TB/86400sec ≈ 926Mb/s

Number of servers estimation:
WhatsApp handles around 10 million connections on a single server, which seems quite high for a server.
No. of servers = Total connections per day/No. of connections per server = 2 billion/10 million = 200 servers
So, according to the above estimates, we require 200 chat servers.

Bandwidth Estimation:
According to the storage capacity estimation, our service will get 10TB of data each day, giving us a bandwidth of 926 Mb/s.
10 TB/86400sec ≈ 926Mb/s

Number of servers estimation:
WhatsApp handles around 10 million connections on a single server, which seems quite high for a server.
No. of servers = Total connections per day/No. of connections per server = 2 billion/10 million = 200 servers
So, according to the above estimates, we require 200 chat servers.

In WhatsApp, each active device is connected with a WebSocket server via WebSocket protocol. A WebSocket server keeps the connection open with all the active (online) users. Since one server isn’t enough to handle billions of devices, there should be enough servers to handle billions of users.

---

4. Support for Group messages
Since user A is connected to a WebSocket server, it sends a message to the message service intended for Group A.The message service sends the message to Kafka with other specific information about the group. The message is saved there for further processing. In Kafka terminology, a group can be a topic, and the senders and receivers can be producers and consumers, respectively.

---

Now, here comes the responsibility of the group service. The group service keeps all information about users in each group in the system. It has all the information about each group, including user IDs, group ID, status, group icon, number of users, and so on. This service resides on top of the MySQL database cluster, with multiple secondary replicas distributed geographically. A Redis cache server also exists to cache data from the MySQL servers. Both geographically distributed replicas and Redis cache aid in reducing latency.

The group message handler communicates with the group service to retrieve data of Group/A users. In the last step, the group message handler follows the same process as a WebSocket server and delivers the message to each user.

---

The media file is compressed and encrypted on the device side.
The compressed and encrypted file is sent to the asset service to store the file on blob storage.
The asset service assigns an ID that’s communicated with the sender. The asset service also maintains a hash for each file to avoid duplication of content on the blob storage.
For example, if a user wants to upload an image that’s already there in the blob storage, the image won’t be uploaded. Instead, the same ID is forwarded to the receiver.
The asset service sends the ID of media files to the receiver via the message service. The receiver downloads the media file from the blob storage using the ID.
The content is loaded onto a CDN if the asset service receives a large number of requests for some particular content.

---

The responsibility of each of these servers is to provide a port to every online user. The mapping between servers, ports, and users is stored in the WebSocket manager that resides on top of a cluster of the data store. In this case, that’s Redis.

2. Send or receive messages

Non-functional Requirements

Approaches

Minimizing latency

Geographically distributed cache management systems and servers
CDNs
Consistency

Provide unique IDs to messages using Sequencer or other mechanisms
Use FIFO messaging queue with strict ordering
Availability

Provide multiple WebSocket servers and managers to establish connections between users
Replication of messages and data associated with users and groups on different servers
Follow disaster recovery protocols
Security

Via end-to-end encryption
Scalability

Performance tuning of servers
Horizontal scalability of services

---

Consistency: Messages should be delivered in the order they were sent.
Availability: The system should be highly available. However, the availability can be compromised in the interest of consistency.
Security: The system must be secure via end-to-end encryption. The end-to-end encryption ensures that only the two communicating parties can see the content of messages. Nobody in between, not even WhatsApp, should have access.
Scalability: The system should be highly scalable to support an ever-increasing number of users and messages per day.
Capacity Estimation
Storage Estimation:
100 billion messages are shared through WhatsApp per day and each message takes 100 bytes on average
100 billion/day∗100 Bytes = 10 TB/day
For 30 days, the storage capacity would become the following:

---

users: This table will contain a user’s information such as name, phoneNumber, and other details.
messages: This table will store messages with properties such as type (text, image, video, etc.), content, and timestamps for message delivery. The message will also have a corresponding chatID or groupID.
chats: This table basically represents a private chat between two users and can contain multiple messages.
users_chats: This table maps users and chats as multiple users can have multiple chats (N:M relationship) and vice versa.
groups: This table represents a group between multiple users.
users_groups: This table maps users and groups as multiple users can be a part of multiple groups (N:M relationship) and vice versa.

1. Connection with Websocket Server
In WhatsApp, each active device is connected with a WebSocket server via WebSocket protocol. A WebSocket server keeps the connection open with all the active (online) users. Since one server isn’t enough to handle billions of devices, there should be enough servers to handle billions of users.

Functional Requirement
Conversation: The system should support one-on-one and group conversations between users.
Acknowledgment: The system should support message delivery acknowledgment, such as sent, delivered, and read.
Sharing: The system should support sharing of media files, such as images, videos, and audio.
Chat storage: The system must support the persistent storage of chat messages when a user is offline until the successful delivery of messages.
Push notifications: The system should be able to notify offline users of new messages once their status becomes online.
Non-Functional Requirement
Low latency: Users should be able to receive messages with low latency.
Consistency: Messages should be delivered in the order they were sent.

Bandwidth Estimation:
According to the storage capacity estimation, our service will get 10TB of data each day, giving us a bandwidth of 926 Mb/s.
10 TB/86400sec ≈ 926Mb/s

Number of servers estimation:
WhatsApp handles around 10 million connections on a single server, which seems quite high for a server.
No. of servers = Total connections per day/No. of connections per server = 2 billion/10 million = 200 servers
So, according to the above estimates, we require 200 chat servers.

Low Level Design (LLD) of System Design
Low-Level-Design(LLD)-of-WhatsApp-Messenger

1. Connection with Websocket Server
In WhatsApp, each active device is connected with a WebSocket server via WebSocket protocol. A WebSocket server keeps the connection open with all the active (online) users. Since one server isn’t enough to handle billions of devices, there should be enough servers to handle billions of users.

---

Functional Requirement
Conversation: The system should support one-on-one and group conversations between users.
Acknowledgment: The system should support message delivery acknowledgment, such as sent, delivered, and read.
Sharing: The system should support sharing of media files, such as images, videos, and audio.
Chat storage: The system must support the persistent storage of chat messages when a user is offline until the successful delivery of messages.
Push notifications: The system should be able to notify offline users of new messages once their status becomes online.
Non-Functional Requirement
Low latency: Users should be able to receive messages with low latency.
Consistency: Messages should be delivered in the order they were sent.

Bandwidth Estimation:
According to the storage capacity estimation, our service will get 10TB of data each day, giving us a bandwidth of 926 Mb/s.
10 TB/86400sec ≈ 926Mb/s

Number of servers estimation:
WhatsApp handles around 10 million connections on a single server, which seems quite high for a server.
No. of servers = Total connections per day/No. of connections per server = 2 billion/10 million = 200 servers
So, according to the above estimates, we require 200 chat servers.

1. Connection with Websocket Server
In WhatsApp, each active device is connected with a WebSocket server via WebSocket protocol. A WebSocket server keeps the connection open with all the active (online) users. Since one server isn’t enough to handle billions of devices, there should be enough servers to handle billions of users.

---

The responsibility of each of these servers is to provide a port to every online user. The mapping between servers, ports, and users is stored in the WebSocket manager that resides on top of a cluster of the data store. In this case, that’s Redis.

2. Send or receive messages
The WebSocket manager is responsible for maintaining a mapping between an active user and a port assigned to the user. Whenever a user is connected to another WebSocket server, this information will be updated in the data store. A WebSocket server also communicates with another service called message service.

---

4. Support for Group messages
Since user A is connected to a WebSocket server, it sends a message to the message service intended for Group A.The message service sends the message to Kafka with other specific information about the group. The message is saved there for further processing. In Kafka terminology, a group can be a topic, and the senders and receivers can be producers and consumers, respectively.

The asset service sends the ID of media files to the receiver via the message service. The receiver downloads the media file from the blob storage using the ID.
The content is loaded onto a CDN if the asset service receives a large number of requests for some particular content.

Now, here comes the responsibility of the group service. The group service keeps all information about users in each group in the system. It has all the information about each group, including user IDs, group ID, status, group icon, number of users, and so on. This service resides on top of the MySQL database cluster, with multiple secondary replicas distributed geographically. A Redis cache server also exists to cache data from the MySQL servers. Both geographically distributed replicas and Redis cache aid in reducing latency.

Bandwidth Estimation:
According to the storage capacity estimation, our service will get 10TB of data each day, giving us a bandwidth of 926 Mb/s.
10 TB/86400sec ≈ 926Mb/s

Number of servers estimation:
WhatsApp handles around 10 million connections on a single server, which seems quite high for a server.
No. of servers = Total connections per day/No. of connections per server = 2 billion/10 million = 200 servers
So, according to the above estimates, we require 200 chat servers.

High Level Design (HLD) of WhatsApp Messenger
High-Level-Design-(HLD)-of-WhatsApp-Messenger

The following steps describe the communication between both clients:

---

Functional Requirement
Conversation: The system should support one-on-one and group conversations between users.
Acknowledgment: The system should support message delivery acknowledgment, such as sent, delivered, and read.
Sharing: The system should support sharing of media files, such as images, videos, and audio.
Chat storage: The system must support the persistent storage of chat messages when a user is offline until the successful delivery of messages.
Push notifications: The system should be able to notify offline users of new messages once their status becomes online.
Non-Functional Requirement
Low latency: Users should be able to receive messages with low latency.
Consistency: Messages should be delivered in the order they were sent.

Explan_explanation: The context discusses the architecture and bandwidth requirements but does not address specific details about VM sizing or resource allocation. Ensuring that virtual machines (VMs) are right-sized for their workloads is typically a practice within server provisioning, which isn't explicitly mentioned in this excerpt focused on communication protocols like WebSocket and data storage needs of WhatsApp Messenger servers.",No,No
Is there any mention of using pre-configured servers that match workload requirements?,"The responsibility of each of these servers is to provide a port to every online user. The mapping between servers, ports, and users is stored in the WebSocket manager that resides on top of a cluster of the data store. In this case, that’s Redis.

2. Send or receive messages
The WebSocket manager is responsible for maintaining a mapping between an active user and a port assigned to the user. Whenever a user is connected to another WebSocket server, this information will be updated in the data store. A WebSocket server also communicates with another service called message service.

In WhatsApp, each active device is connected with a WebSocket server via WebSocket protocol. A WebSocket server keeps the connection open with all the active (online) users. Since one server isn’t enough to handle billions of devices, there should be enough servers to handle billions of users.

---

The responsibility of each of these servers is to provide a port to every online user. The mapping between servers, ports, and users is stored in the WebSocket manager that resides on top of a cluster of the data store. In this case, that’s Redis.

2. Send or receive messages
The WebSocket manager is responsible for maintaining a mapping between an active user and a port assigned to the user. Whenever a user is connected to another WebSocket server, this information will be updated in the data store. A WebSocket server also communicates with another service called message service.

---

4. Support for Group messages
Since user A is connected to a WebSocket server, it sends a message to the message service intended for Group A.The message service sends the message to Kafka with other specific information about the group. The message is saved there for further processing. In Kafka terminology, a group can be a topic, and the senders and receivers can be producers and consumers, respectively.

---

Now, here comes the responsibility of the group service. The group service keeps all information about users in each group in the system. It has all the information about each group, including user IDs, group ID, status, group icon, number of users, and so on. This service resides on top of the MySQL database cluster, with multiple secondary replicas distributed geographically. A Redis cache server also exists to cache data from the MySQL servers. Both geographically distributed replicas and Redis cache aid in reducing latency.

The group message handler communicates with the group service to retrieve data of Group/A users. In the last step, the group message handler follows the same process as a WebSocket server and delivers the message to each user.

---

The media file is compressed and encrypted on the device side.
The compressed and encrypted file is sent to the asset service to store the file on blob storage.
The asset service assigns an ID that’s communicated with the sender. The asset service also maintains a hash for each file to avoid duplication of content on the blob storage.
For example, if a user wants to upload an image that’s already there in the blob storage, the image won’t be uploaded. Instead, the same ID is forwarded to the receiver.
The asset service sends the ID of media files to the receiver via the message service. The receiver downloads the media file from the blob storage using the ID.

Low Level Design (LLD) of System Design
Low-Level-Design(LLD)-of-WhatsApp-Messenger

1. Connection with Websocket Server
In WhatsApp, each active device is connected with a WebSocket server via WebSocket protocol. A WebSocket server keeps the connection open with all the active (online) users. Since one server isn’t enough to handle billions of devices, there should be enough servers to handle billions of users.

---

The responsibility of each of these servers is to provide a port to every online user. The mapping between servers, ports, and users is stored in the WebSocket manager that resides on top of a cluster of the data store. In this case, that’s Redis.

2. Send or receive messages
The WebSocket manager is responsible for maintaining a mapping between an active user and a port assigned to the user. Whenever a user is connected to another WebSocket server, this information will be updated in the data store. A WebSocket server also communicates with another service called message service.

---

4. Support for Group messages
Since user A is connected to a WebSocket server, it sends a message to the message service intended for Group A.The message service sends the message to Kafka with other specific information about the group. The message is saved there for further processing. In Kafka terminology, a group can be a topic, and the senders and receivers can be producers and consumers, respectively.

---

Now, here comes the responsibility of the group service. The group service keeps all information about users in each group in the system. It has all the information about each group, including user IDs, group ID, status, group icon, number of users, and so on. This service resides on top of the MySQL database cluster, with multiple secondary replicas distributed geographically. A Redis cache server also exists to cache data from the MySQL servers. Both geographically distributed replicas and Redis cache aid in reducing latency.

The group message handler communicates with the group service to retrieve data of Group/A users. In the last step, the group message handler follows the same process as a WebSocket server and delivers the message to each user.

Bandwidth Estimation:
According to the storage capacity estimation, our service will get 10TB of data each day, giving us a bandwidth of 926 Mb/s.

Number of servers estimation:
WhatsApp handles around 10 million connections on a single server, which seems quite high for a server.
No. of servers = Total connections per day/No. of connections per server = 2 billion/10 million = 200 servers
So, according to the above estimates, we require 200 chat servers.

Low-Level-Design(LLD)-of-WhatsApp-Messenger

1. Connection with Websocket Server
In WhatsApp, each active device is connected with a WebSocket server via WebSocket protocol. A WebSocket server keeps the connection open with all the active (online) users. Since one server isn’t enough to handle billions of devices, there should be enough servers to handle billions of users.

Bandwidth Estimation:
According to the storage capacity estimation, our service will get 10TB of data each day, giving us a bandwidth of 926 Mb/s.
10 TB/86400sec ≈ 926Mb/s

Number of servers estimation:
WhatsApp handles around 10 million connections on a single server, which seems quite high for a server.
No. of servers = Total connections per day/No. of connections per server = 2 billion/10 million = 200 servers
So, according to the above estimates, we require 200 chat servers.

1. Connection with Websocket Server
In WhatsApp, each active device is connected with a WebSocket server via WebSocket protocol. A WebSocket server keeps the connection open with all the active (online) users. Since one server isn’t enough to handle billions of devices, there should be enough servers to handle billions of users.

---

Functional Requirement
Conversation: The system should support one-on-one and group conversations between users.
Acknowledgment: The system should support message delivery acknowledgment, such as sent, delivered, and read.
Sharing: The system should support sharing of media files, such as images, videos, and audio.
Chat storage: The system must support the persistent storage of chat messages when a user is offline until the successful delivery of messages.
Push notifications: The system should be able to notify offline users of new messages once their status becomes online.
Non-Functional Requirement
Low latency: Users should be able to receive messages with low latency.
Consistency: Messages should be delivered in the order they were sent.

---

Bandwidth Estimation:
According to the storage capacity estimation, our service will get 10TB of data each day, giving us a bandwidth of 926 Mb/s.
10 TB/86400sec ≈ 926Mb/s

Number of servers estimation:
WhatsApp handles around 10 million connections on a single server, which seems quite high for a server.
No. of servers = Total connections per day/No. of connections per server = 2 billion/10 million = 200 servers
So, according to the above estimates, we require 200 chat servers.

Low Level Design (LLD) of System Design
Low-Level-Design(LLD)-of-WhatsApp-Messenger

1. Connection with Websocket Server
In WhatsApp, each active device is connected with a WebSocket server via WebSocket protocol. A WebSocket server keeps the connection open with all the active (online) users. Since one server isn’t enough to handle billions of devices, there should be enough servers to handle billions of users.

---

The responsibility of each of these servers is to provide a port to every online user. The mapping between servers, ports, and users is stored in the WebSocket manager that resides on top of a cluster of the data store. In this case, that’s Redis.

2. Send or receive messages
The WebSocket manager is responsible for maintaining a mapping between an active user and a port assigned to the user. Whenever a user is connected to another WebSocket server, this information will be updated in the data store. A WebSocket server also communicates with another service called message service.

---

Now, here comes the responsibility of the group service. The group service keeps all information about users in each group in the system. It has all the information about each group, including user IDs, group ID, status, group icon, number of users, and so on. This service resides on top of the MySQL database cluster, with multiple secondary replicas distributed geographically. A Redis cache server also exists to cache data from the MySQL servers. Both geographically distributed replicas and Redis cache aid in reducing latency.

The group message handler communicates with the group service to retrieve data of Group/A users. In the last step, the group message handler follows the same process as a WebSocket server and delivers the message to each user.

---

4. Support for Group messages
Since user A is connected to a WebSocket server, it sends a message to the message service intended for Group A.The message service sends the message to Kafka with other specific information about the group. The message is saved there for further processing. In Kafka terminology, a group can be a topic, and the senders and receivers can be producers and consumers, respectively.

The media file is compressed and encrypted on the device side.
The compressed and encrypted file is sent to the asset service to store the file on blob storage.
The asset service assigns an ID that’s communicated with the sender. The asset service also maintains a hash for each file to avoid duplication of content on the blob storage.
For example, if a user wants to upload an image that’s already there in the blob storage, the image won’t be uploaded. Instead, the same ID is forwarded to the receiver.
The asset service sends the ID of media files to the receiver via the message service. The receiver downloads the media file from the blob storage using the ID.
The content is loaded onto a CDN if the asset service receives a large number of requests for some particular content.",7.75438117980957," Judgement: No
