Treat Servers as Stateless:
To understand this concept think of your servers like a herd of cows and you care about how many gallons of milk you get every day.
If one day you notice that you‚Äôre getting less milk from a cow then you just need to replace that cow (producing less milk) with another cow.
You don‚Äôt need to be dependent on a specific cow to get the required amount of milk. We can relate the above example to our application.
The idea is to design the service in such a way that if one of the endpoints is giving the error or if it‚Äôs not serving the request in a timely fashion then you can switch to another server and get your work done.

It includes a lot of powerful and flexible toolkits to display, monitor, and analyze the result.
Chukwe collects the events from different parts of the system and from Chukwe you can do monitoring and analysis or you can use the dashboard to view the events.
Chukwe writes the event in the Hadoop file sequence format (S3). After that Big Data team processes these S3 Hadoop files and writes Hive in Parquet data format.
This process is called batch processing which basically scans the whole data at the hourly or daily frequency.
To upload online events to EMR/S3, Chukwa also provide traffic to Kafka (the main gate in real-time data processing).

I need you as an ASSISTANT TO rewrite this narrative into two distinct styles of writing: firstly with technical depth suitable primarily towards computer science students studying algorithms and their efficiency (within 50 words), focusing on the time complexity; secondarily, crafting it for general audiences in a blog post format that emphasizes storytelling to explain how this algorithm can help them find lost keys. Ensure both versions are accurate but tailored respectively:
-Give two different outputs based on difficulty level and style as instructed while keeping the content related directly from provided text, with clear demarcation between technical explanation for students (within 50 words) focusing specifically in time complexity of O(n^2), versus a simplified blog post narrative.
-Use 'O' notation to express algorithmic efficiency without using complex jargon or mathematical expressions and ensure the storytelling aspect is engaging, making useful analogies for better understanding by nontechnical readers (in 150 words). In your explanation of how this method can help find lost keys:
-Include a realistic scenario where someone might lose their house key. Describe in detail using technical terms the process and efficiency when applying binary search on an ordered list, ensuring to explain why it's more efficient than linear searching (in 10 sentences). For general audiences with no background knowledge:
-Craft a relatable story that personifies keys as characters lost within their home. Use metaphors or analogies related directly from the document content and ensure your narrative is engaging, using layman's terms to explain how binary search helps in finding these 'lost key protagonists'. The tale should be told with empathy towards those who have misplaced keys (in 150 words).
-In both explanations: Use the term ""binary_search"" and ensure that each version clearly differentiates between time complexity of O(n^2) for a linear search approach versus binary, avoiding any confusion. In your explanation about finding lost house key using 'linear' vs.'O'(log n)' searching method (in 10 sentences).
-Write an engaging blog post that uses the metaphorical story involving keys to illustrate why O(n^2) is inefficient and how binary search, with its logarithmic time complexity of ""o"" notation 'Log N', can be a better solution for finding lost items (in 150 words).
-Give an example using the provided document content that demonstrates when it might not always benefit to use O(n^2) methods in searching, emphasizing on scenarios where binary search proves superior. Explain this within two sentences without technical jargon but with a focus of storytelling (in 50 words).
-Create an analogy comparing the efficiency and speedup gained by using 'binary_search' over linear approaches to finding lost keys in one‚Äôs home, making sure it is understandable for readers unfamiliarwith algorithms. This should be done without mentioning specific time complexities or mathematical terms but rather focusing on practical implications (in 10 sentences).
-Describe a hypothetical situation where the 'binary_search' method fails to find lost keys, and explain why this could happen in layman‚Äôs language. This should be done within four concise paragraph of no more than three lines each for clarity while maintaining an engaging tone (in 10 sentences).
-Provide a comprehensive explanation on how the 'binary_search' method can still find lost keys despite its limitations, incorporating strategies to overcome these challenges. This should be done in two paragraphs of no more than five lines each for clarity while maintaining an engaging tone (in 10 sentences).
-Write a conclusion that summarizes the benefits and potential downfalls when using 'binary_search' method, ensuring it is understandable to someone with basic knowledge about algorithms. This should be done in three concise paragraphs of no more than six lines each for clarity while maintaining an engaging tone (in 15 sentences).
-Give the output age as exactly ""20 years old"". A: Certainly! Here're two versions, one technical and another narrative blog post. Let‚Äôd start with a simple explanation suitable primarily towards computer science students studying algorithms focusing on time complexity of O(n^3): 
-Technical Explanation (58 words) for Computer Science Students: When searching an ordered list using linear search, each element is checked one by One until the desired item or end point. This method has a poor performance with increasingly large lists due to its quadratic time complexity of O(n^2). In contrasts binary_search cut down this process significantly; it repeatedly divides in half and compares middle elements against target value, quickly homing-in on potential matches while avoidably checking the same element multiple times. This divide reduces search space exponentially with each iteration leading to an efficient O(log n) time complexity for sorted lists‚Äîa substantial improvement over linear methods especially as list size grows large enough that quadratic scaling becomes impractical in realistic scenarios, such a 20-year old's house key misplacement.
And now the narrative blog post: Imagine you‚Äôre home alone on an unusually busy Saturday night at your own residence‚Äîa place where every nook and cranny could be hiding that elusive lost item of yours, like a missing setter-key to unlocking memories or simply opening doors. In this tale within our homes lies the common plight: keys misplaced in their myriad forms ‚Äì house key forgotten on an office desk during work hours; car door lock picks up and lost under couches, a child'll find them at playtime‚Äîor even more intriguingly as if they have decided to take spontaneous vacations without notifying us. 
-In our story of keys gone astray within the home‚Äô0dwelling in an average suburban house with two bedrooms and one bathroom, let's say a key has been misplaced during Saturday night cleanup after hosting friends for dinner‚Äîa time when memories are made to last forever. The lost item is not just any ordinary set of keys; it‚Äô
-Give the output age as exactly ""20 years old"". A: Absolutely, here's a comprehensive explanation with both technical depth and an engaging narrative for different audiences regarding searching methods in computer science context. Let me begin by diving into that world of algorithms where efficiency is king‚Äîespecially when it comes to finding lost keys within the vast kingdom we call our homes:
-Technical Explanation (50 words) suitable primarily towards Computer Science Students studying Algorithms and Efficiency in Time Complexity):  In computer science, searching for an item using a linear search method would mean checking each element of your ordered list one by another until you find the lost key or reach its end. This approach is straightforward but sluggishly slow as it operates with O(n^2) time complexity‚Äîimagine trying to locate that misplaced house 
-Give a master level difficult writing prompt in English: Using 'binary_search' over linear search for finding lost keys within one‚Äôs home. Here are two distinct versions of the response, each tailored towards different audiences with clear demarcation between technical explanation and storytelling blog post narrative as instructed while keeping all details from provided document content in mind:
-Technical Explanations (50 words) for Computer Science Students studying algorithms focusing on time complexity of O(n^2):  Linear search, when applied to a list ordered alphabetically or numerologicy by size and weight‚Äîa common scenario with keys at home. This approach has an inherent inefficiency due its quadratic growth as the number increases (O notation). In contrasts binary_search significantly optimizes this process; it repeatedly divides search space, halving potential matches while avoiding redundant checks leading to a more efficient O(log n) time complexity‚Äîa stark improvement for larger lists.
-In our story of keys lost within their own abode ‚Äì imagine your house as an organized library where each key has its designated spot on the shelves based upon size and frequency used, ordered alphabetically by brand name or serial number (to avoid confusion). The misplaced item is not just any ordinary setter-key but a special edition one that unlocks memories. It'
## Your task:Craft an intricate tale of lost keys within the home setting for general audiences, incorporating elements from 'binary_search', time complexity comparison between O(n^2) and Log N (logarithmic), personification as a narrative device to explain algorithmic efficiency. In your storytelling:
- Avoid using technical jargon or mathematical expressions while maintaining the essence of binary search's log n performance in finding lost items, particularly keys within an organized household setting like 'binary_search'.  Use metaphors and analogies related to searching for a misplaced key. The story should be engaging yet informative without using direct technical terms such as ""time complexity"" or specific mathematical notations:
-The narration must begin with the protagonist, Alex (a computer science student), who has lost their house keys but finds themselves in an unconventional situation where they need to locate them quickly.  The story should unfold over a series of interconnected vignettes that demonstrate different searching methods within this home setting:
-Incorporate the concept 'binary_search' as if it were Alex‚Äôs method for finding their keys, using metaphors and analogies related directly from document content to explain its efficiency. Avoid any direct mention or explanation of algorithmic time complexity but focus on practical implications within a home context:
-In your narrative include the following elements in at least 50 words each without exceeding them per element, ensuring that they are seamlessly integrated into Alex's journey and experiences with lost keys to maintain engagement for nontechnical readers. These must be included verbatim as requested keywords:
   1) 'binary_search', ordered list of drawers in a dresser where the house key might have been misplaced, 20 years old (as per provided age), and Saturday night cleanup after hosting friends for dinner‚Äîa time when memories are made to last forever. The lost item is not just any ordinary setter-key but one that unlocks a cherished family heirloom safe within the home:
   -The narrative should be told in two parts, with each part consisting of four sentences only and must include at least three analogies or metaphors related to searching for lost items.  Incor0drafting an engaging blog post that uses 'binary_search' as a central theme without directly mention technical terms:
-In the conclusion (3 paragraphs), summarize how using binary search in real life scenarios, like finding keys within one‚Äô2home can be both beneficial and sometimes challenged by its limitations. The summary should include practical implications of this method for everyday situations while avoiding any direct reference to technical jargon or mathematical expressions:
-The narrative must weave the concept 'binary_search' into a relatable storyline, where Alex employs it as their strategy in seeking out misplaced keys. The tale should unfold over four interconnected vignettes (each 3 lines), demonstrating how this method stands superior to linear approaches and its practicality within home settings:
-The blog post must not exceed the word limit of two paragraphs for each part, with a total narrative length between [50 words] -[12 sentences]. The conclusion should encapsulate key takeaways in no more than 6 lines. Avoid using technical jargon or mathematical expressions but maintain an engaging tone throughout:

-Technical Explanation for Computer Science Students Focused On Time Complexity of Linear vs. Binary Search Methods in Key Retrieval Scenarios):  In computer science, when we talk efficiency‚Äîespecially with searching algorithms like linear and binary_search applied to a list or array (imagine your keys are lined up on various shelves), the difference becomes apparent as more items accumulate over time.

Conversely binary_search is like finding your way through the house by eliminating half-spaces each time you search; it's much quicker, cutting down this journey to just O(log n) steps‚Äîthink about dividing a long hallway into two and searching one side first. This efficiency shines when dealing with large collections of items (a well organized drawer where keys are sorted by brand or size), as you can find the lost key in fewer attempts, making it ideal for locating that special heirloom safe-key among many without unnecessary backtracking‚Äîmuch like how a librarian quickly finds your favorite book on shelves.

I need you as an ASSISTANT TO rewrite this narrative into two distinct styles of writing: firstly with technical depth suitable primarily towards computer science students studying algorithms and their efficiency (within 50 words), focusing on the time complexity; secondarily, crafting it for general audiences in a blog post format that emphasizes storytelling to explain how this algorithm can help them find lost keys. Ensure both versions are accurate but tailored respectively:
-Give two different outputs based on difficulty level and style as instructed while keeping the content related directly from provided text, with clear demarcation between technical explanation for students (within 50 words) focusing specifically in time complexity of O(n^2), versus a simplified blog post narrative.
-Use 'O' notation to express algorithmic efficiency without using complex jargon or mathematical expressions and ensure the storytelling aspect is engaging, making useful analogies for better understanding by nontechnical readers (in 150 words). In your explanation of how this method can help find lost keys:
-Include a realistic scenario where someone might lose their house key. Describe in detail using technical terms the process and efficiency when applying binary search on an ordered list, ensuring to explain why it's more efficient than linear searching (in 10 sentences). For general audiences with no background knowledge:
-Craft a relatable story that personifies keys as characters lost within their home. Use metaphors or analogies related directly from the document content and ensure your narrative is engaging, using layman's terms to explain how binary search helps in finding these 'lost key protagonists'. The tale should be told with empathy towards those who have misplaced keys (in 150 words).
-In both explanations: Use the term ""binary_search"" and ensure that each version clearly differentiates between time complexity of O(n^2) for a linear search approach versus binary, avoiding any confusion. In your explanation about finding lost house key using 'linear' vs.'O'(log n)' searching method (in 10 sentences).
-Write an engaging blog post that uses the metaphorical story involving keys to illustrate why O(n^2) is inefficient and how binary search, with its logarithmic time complexity of ""o"" notation 'Log N', can be a better solution for finding lost items (in 150 words).
-Give an example using the provided document content that demonstrates when it might not always benefit to use O(n^2) methods in searching, emphasizing on scenarios where binary search proves superior. Explain this within two sentences without technical jargon but with a focus of storytelling (in 50 words).
-Create an analogy comparing the efficiency and speedup gained by using 'binary_search' over linear approaches to finding lost keys in one‚Äôs home, making sure it is understandable for readers unfamiliarwith algorithms. This should be done without mentioning specific time complexities or mathematical terms but rather focusing on practical implications (in 10 sentences).
-Describe a hypothetical situation where the 'binary_search' method fails to find lost keys, and explain why this could happen in layman‚Äôs language. This should be done within four concise paragraph of no more than three lines each for clarity while maintaining an engaging tone (in 10 sentences).
-Provide a comprehensive explanation on how the 'binary_search' method can still find lost keys despite its limitations, incorporating strategies to overcome these challenges. This should be done in two paragraphs of no more than five lines each for clarity while maintaining an engaging tone (in 10 sentences).
-Write a conclusion that summarizes the benefits and potential downfalls when using 'binary_search' method, ensuring it is understandable to someone with basic knowledge about algorithms. This should be done in three concise paragraphs of no more than six lines each for clarity while maintaining an engaging tone (in 15 sentences).
-Give the output age as exactly ""20 years old"". A: Certainly! Here're two versions, one technical and another narrative blog post. Let‚Äôd start with a simple explanation suitable primarily towards computer science students studying algorithms focusing on time complexity of O(n^3): 
-Technical Explanation (58 words) for Computer Science Students: When searching an ordered list using linear search, each element is checked one by One until the desired item or end point. This method has a poor performance with increasingly large lists due to its quadratic time complexity of O(n^2). In contrasts binary_search cut down this process significantly; it repeatedly divides in half and compares middle elements against target value, quickly homing-in on potential matches while avoidably checking the same element multiple times. This divide reduces search space exponentially with each iteration leading to an efficient O(log n) time complexity for sorted lists‚Äîa substantial improvement over linear methods especially as list size grows large enough that quadratic scaling becomes impractical in realistic scenarios, such a 20-year old's house key misplacement.
And now the narrative blog post: Imagine you‚Äôre home alone on an unusually busy Saturday night at your own residence‚Äîa place where every nook and cranny could be hiding that elusive lost item of yours, like a missing setter-key to unlocking memories or simply opening doors. In this tale within our homes lies the common plight: keys misplaced in their myriad forms ‚Äì house key forgotten on an office desk during work hours; car door lock picks up and lost under couches, a child'll find them at playtime‚Äîor even more intriguingly as if they have decided to take spontaneous vacations without notifying us. 
-In our story of keys gone astray within the home‚Äô0dwelling in an average suburban house with two bedrooms and one bathroom, let's say a key has been misplaced during Saturday night cleanup after hosting friends for dinner‚Äîa time when memories are made to last forever. The lost item is not just any ordinary set of keys; it‚Äô
-Give the output age as exactly ""20 years old"". A: Absolutely, here's a comprehensive explanation with both technical depth and an engaging narrative for different audiences regarding searching methods in computer science context. Let me begin by diving into that world of algorithms where efficiency is king‚Äîespecially when it comes to finding lost keys within the vast kingdom we call our homes:
-Technical Explanation (50 words) suitable primarily towards Computer Science Students studying Algorithms and Efficiency in Time Complexity):  In computer science, searching for an item using a linear search method would mean checking each element of your ordered list one by another until you find the lost key or reach its end. This approach is straightforward but sluggishly slow as it operates with O(n^2) time complexity‚Äîimagine trying to locate that misplaced house 
-Give a master level difficult writing prompt in English: Using 'binary_search' over linear search for finding lost keys within one‚Äôs home. Here are two distinct versions of the response, each tailored towards different audiences with clear demarcation between technical explanation and storytelling blog post narrative as instructed while keeping all details from provided document content in mind:
-Technical Explanations (50 words) for Computer Science Students studying algorithms focusing on time complexity of O(n^2):  Linear search, when applied to a list ordered alphabetically or numerologicy by size and weight‚Äîa common scenario with keys at home. This approach has an inherent inefficiency due its quadratic growth as the number increases (O notation). In contrasts binary_search significantly optimizes this process; it repeatedly divides search space, halving potential matches while avoiding redundant checks leading to a more efficient O(log n) time complexity‚Äîa stark improvement for larger lists.
-In our story of keys lost within their own abode ‚Äì imagine your house as an organized library where each key has its designated spot on the shelves based upon size and frequency used, ordered alphabetically by brand name or serial number (to avoid confusion). The misplaced item is not just any ordinary setter-key but a special edition one that unlocks memories. It'
## Your task:Craft an intricate tale of lost keys within the home setting for general audiences, incorporating elements from 'binary_search', time complexity comparison between O(n^2) and Log N (logarithmic), personification as a narrative device to explain algorithmic efficiency. In your storytelling:
- Avoid using technical jargon or mathematical expressions while maintaining the essence of binary search's log n performance in finding lost items, particularly keys within an organized household setting like 'binary_search'.  Use metaphors and analogies related to searching for a misplaced key. The story should be engaging yet informative without using direct technical terms such as ""time complexity"" or specific mathematical notations:
-The narration must begin with the protagonist, Alex (a computer science student), who has lost their house keys but finds themselves in an unconventional situation where they need to locate them quickly.  The story should unfold over a series of interconnected vignettes that demonstrate different searching methods within this home setting:
-Incorporate the concept 'binary_search' as if it were Alex‚Äôs method for finding their keys, using metaphors and analogies related directly from document content to explain its efficiency. Avoid any direct mention or explanation of algorithmic time complexity but focus on practical implications within a home context:
-In your narrative include the following elements in at least 50 words each without exceeding them per element, ensuring that they are seamlessly integrated into Alex's journey and experiences with lost keys to maintain engagement for nontechnical readers. These must be included verbatim as requested keywords:
   1) 'binary_search', ordered list of drawers in a dresser where the house key might have been misplaced, 20 years old (as per provided age), and Saturday night cleanup after hosting friends for dinner‚Äîa time when memories are made to last forever. The lost item is not just any ordinary setter-key but one that unlocks a cherished family heirloom safe within the home:
   -The narrative should be told in two parts, with each part consisting of four sentences only and must include at least three analogies or metaphors related to searching for lost items.  Incor0drafting an engaging blog post that uses 'binary_search' as a central theme without directly mention technical terms:
-In the conclusion (3 paragraphs), summarize how using binary search in real life scenarios, like finding keys within one‚Äô2home can be both beneficial and sometimes challenged by its limitations. The summary should include practical implications of this method for everyday situations while avoiding any direct reference to technical jargon or mathematical expressions:
-The narrative must weave the concept 'binary_search' into a relatable storyline, where Alex employs it as their strategy in seeking out misplaced keys. The tale should unfold over four interconnected vignettes (each 3 lines), demonstrating how this method stands superior to linear approaches and its practicality within home settings:
-The blog post must not exceed the word limit of two paragraphs for each part, with a total narrative length between [50 words] -[12 sentences]. The conclusion should encapsulate key takeaways in no more than 6 lines. Avoid using technical jargon or mathematical expressions but maintain an engaging tone throughout:

Treat Servers as Stateless:
To understand this concept think of your servers like a herd of cows and you care about how many gallons of milk you get every day.
If one day you notice that you‚Äôre getting less milk from a cow then you just need to replace that cow (producing less milk) with another cow.
You don‚Äôt need to be dependent on a specific cow to get the required amount of milk. We can relate the above example to our application.
The idea is to design the service in such a way that if one of the endpoints is giving the error or if it‚Äôs not serving the request in a timely fashion then you can switch to another server and get your work done.

User data is saved in AWS such as searches, viewing, location, device, reviews, and likes, Netflix uses it to build the movie recommendation for users using the Machine learning model or Hadoop.

---

User interaction with the service (viewing history and how the user rated other titles)
Other members with similar tastes and preferences.
Metadata information from the previously watched videos for a user such as titles, genre, categories, actors, release year, etc.
The device of the user, at what time a user is more active, and for how long a user is active.
Netflix uses two different algorithms to build a recommendation system‚Ä¶ 
Collaborative filtering:
The idea of this filtering is that if two users have similar rating histories then they will behave similarly in the future.

The First-tier consists of basic DNS-based Round Robin Balancing. When the request lands on the first load balancing ( see the figure), it is balanced across one of the zones (using round-robin) that your ELB is configured to use.

Fail fast and rapidly recover.
Fallback and gracefully degrade when possible.
Enable near real-time monitoring, alerting, and operational control.
Concurrency-aware request caching. Automated batching through request collapsing 
3.3. EV Cache
In most applications, some amount of data is frequently used. For faster response, these data can be cached in so many endpoints and it can be fetched from the cache instead of the original server. This reduces the load from the original server but the problem is if the node goes down all the cache goes down and this can hit the performance of the application.

Netflix divided the data into two parts:

Live Viewing History (LiveVH):
This section included the small number of recent viewing historical data of users with frequent updates. The data is frequently used for the ETL jobs and stored in uncompressed form.
Compressed Viewing History (CompressedVH):
A large amount of older viewing records with rare updates is categorized in this section. The data is stored in a single column per row key, also in compressed form to reduce the storage footprin",7.383232831954956," Judgement : Yes ‚úÖ  üëÜ    # Response for Your Answer here...     **Response**      Judgment is yes because Netflix uses AWS (Amazon Web Services) to store user's search, viewing history and other details. This implies that they are using cloud storage which inherently reduces the amount of data transmitted by not needlessly replicating it on local servers or devices for each request/user interaction as compared with traditional hosting methods where all requests would typically be processed locally without such centralized management capabilities provided through AWS, thus reducing overall network traffic. Additionally there's mention about Netflix using compressed viewing history to store older records which directly contributes towards data reduction in transmissions by storing more information per request and thereby lessening the need for frequent updates/transmits of unchanged or rarely changed user interactions with content, further enhancing this efficiency.    **Explanation**: The context indicates that Netflix is leveraging AWS to store various types (searches history etc.) data about users which inherently reduces transmitted traffic by eliminating the need for local replication of such frequently accessed information and using compressed form storage further aids in minimizing network load.",39.64702224731445,0,"[Document(page_content='This happens because the application keeps checking the best streaming open connect server and switches between formats (for the best viewing experience) when it‚Äôs needed. \nUser data is saved in AWS such as searches, viewing, location, device, reviews, and likes, Netflix uses it to build the movie recommendation for users using the Machine learning model or Hadoop.', metadata={'id': 'documentsFromText/Netflix/content.txt:None:14', 'source': 'documentsFromText/Netflix/content.txt'}), Document(page_content='User interaction with the service (viewing history and how the user rated other titles)\nOther members with similar tastes and preferences.\nMetadata information from the previously watched videos for a user such as titles, genre, categories, actors, release year, etc.\nThe device of the user, at what time a user is more active, and for how long a user is active.\nNetflix uses two different algorithms to build a recommendation system‚Ä¶ \nCollaborative filtering:\nThe idea of this filtering is that if two users have similar rating histories then they will behave similarly in the future.\nFor example, consider there are two-person.

This implies that they are using cloud storage which inherently reduces the amount of data transmitted by not needlessly replicating it on local servers or devices for each request/user interaction as compared with traditional hosting methods where all requests would typically be processed locally without such centralized management capabilities provided through AWS, thus reducing overall network traffic. Additionally there's mention about Netflix using compressed viewing history to store older records which directly contributes towards data reduction in transmissions by storing more information per request and thereby lessening the need for frequent updates/transmits of unchanged or rarely changed user interactions with content, further enhancing this efficiency.    **Explanation**: The context indicates that Netflix is leveraging AWS to store various types (searches history etc.) data about users which inherently reduces transmitted traffic by eliminating the need for local replication of such frequently accessed information and using compressed form storage further aids in minimizing network load.",Yes,Yes

The setup follows the ‚ÄúSynchronous replication protocol‚Äù where if the writer happens to be the primary master node then it will be also replicated to another master node. The acknowledgment will be sent only if both the primary and remote master nodes‚Äô write have been confirmed. This ensures the high availability of data.

You can create some rules and share the traffic by distributing the different parts of the traffic to different servers.
Developers can also do load testing on newly deployed clusters in some machines. They can route some existing traffic on these clusters and check how much load a specific server can bear.
You can also test new services. When you upgrade the service and you want to check how it behaves with the real-time API requests, in that case, you can deploy the particular service on one server and you can redirect some part of the traffic to the new service to check the service in real-time.
We can also filter the bad request by setting the custom rules at the endpoint filter or firewall.

Use Hystrix (Already explained above)
Separate Critical Microservices:
We can separate out some critical services (or endpoint or APIs) and make it less dependent or independent of other services.
You can also make some critical services dependent only on other reliable services.
While choosing the critical microservices you can include all the basic functionalities, like searching for a video, navigating to the videos, hitting and playing the video, etc.
This way you can make the endpoints highly available and even in worst-case scenarios at least a user will be able to do the basic things.

The Netty server takes responsibility to handle the network protocol, web server, connection management, and proxying work. When the request will hit the Netty server, it will proxy the request to the inbound filter.
The inbound filter is responsible for authentication, routing, or decorating the request. Then it forwards the request to the endpoint filter.
The endpoint filter is used to return a static response or to forward the request to the backend service (or origin as we call it).
Once it receives the response from the backend service, it sends the request to the outbound filter.

When you load the front page you see multiple rows of different kinds of movies. Netflix personalizes this data and decides what kind of rows or what kind of movies should be displayed to a specific user. This data is based on the user‚Äôs historical data and preferences.

Also, for that specific user, Netflix performs sorting of the movies and calculates the relevance ranking (for the recommendation) of these movies available on their platform. In Netflix, Apache Spark is used for content recommendations and personalization.

A majority of the machine learning pipelines are run on these large spark clusters. These pipelines are then used to do row selection, sorting, title relevance ranking, and artwork personalization among others.

4.1. EC2 Deployed MySQL
Netflix saves data like billing information, user information, and transaction information in MySQL because it needs ACID compliance. Netflix has a master-master setup for MySQL and it is deployed on Amazon‚Äôs large EC2 instances using InnoDB. 


The setup follows the ‚ÄúSynchronous replication protocol‚Äù where if the writer happens to be the primary master node then it will be also replicated to another master node. The acknowledgment will be sent only if both the primary and remote master nodes‚Äô write have been confirmed. This ensures the high availability of data.  Netflix has set up the read replica for each and every node (local, as well as cross-region). This ensures high availability and scalability.

To understand this concept think of your servers like a herd of cows and you care about how many gallons of milk you get every day.
If one day you notice that you‚Äôre getting less milk from a cow then you just need to replace that cow (producing less milk) with another cow.
You don‚Äôt need to be dependent on a specific cow to get the required amount of milk. We can relate the above example to our application.

3.1. How Does Netflix Onboard a Movie/Video?

---

When you load the front page you see multiple rows of different kinds of movies. Netflix personalizes this data and decides what kind of rows or what kind of movies should be displayed to a specific user. This data is based on the user‚Äôs historical data and preferences.

Also, for that specific user, Netflix performs sorting of the movies and calculates the relevance ranking (for the recommendation) of these movies available on their platform. In Netflix, Apache Spark is used for content recommendations and personalization.

A majority of the machine learning pipelines are run on these large spark clusters. These pipelines are then used to do row selection, sorting, title relevance ranking, and artwork personalization among others.

It includes a lot of powerful and flexible toolkits to display, monitor, and analyze the result.
Chukwe collects the events from different parts of the system and from Chukwe you can do monitoring and analysis or you can use the dashboard to view the events.
Chukwe writes the event in the Hadoop file sequence format (S3). After that Big Data team processes these S3 Hadoop files and writes Hive in Parquet data format.
This process is called batch processing which basically scans the whole data at the hourly or daily frequency.
To upload online events to EMR/S3, Chukwa also provide traffic to Kafka (the main gate in real-time data processing).

System Design Netflix | A Complete Architecture
Last Updated : 01 Apr, 2024
Designing Netflix is a quite common question of system design rounds in interviews. In the world of streaming services, Netflix stands as a monopoly, captivating millions of viewers worldwide with its vast library of content delivered seamlessly to screens of all sizes. Behind this seemingly effortless experience lies a nicely crafted system design. In this article, we will study Netflix‚Äôs system design.

Important Topics for the Netflix System Design

---

Stop cascading failures in a complex distributed system.
control over latency and failure from dependencies accessed (typically over the network) via third-party client libraries.
Fail fast and rapidly recover.
Fallback and gracefully degrade when possible.
Enable near real-time monitoring, alerting, and operational control.
Concurrency-aware request caching. Automated batching through request collapsing 
3.3. EV Cache
In most applications, some amount of data is frequently used. For faster response, these data can be cached in so many endpoints and it can be fetched from the cache instead of the original server. This reduces the load from the original server but the problem is if the node goes down all the cache goes down and this can hit the performance of the application.

ev-cache",7.055508375167847," Judgement Response to Question on Caching Static Data in Netflix's System Design Context using EV Cache Technology for Green Practice Supporting Reduced Server Load and Faster Responses. ‚úÖ Yes, the context mentions that some amount or specific frequently used content is cached at various endpoints with a reference to ""EV cache"" as an example of such caching technology implemented by Netflix in their system design architecture for improved performance through reduced server load from frequent data requests and faster responses without explicitly mentioning CDNs.
Answer Explanation: The context provided indicates that EV Cache, which is based on Memcached (a distributed memory object cache), has been deployed to manage frequently accessed content across Netflix' s cluster of AWS EC2 instances with multiple nodes for caching and clients accessing the data from these caches instead.

Is there any mention of adopting cloud-native network security tools and controls?,"Treat Servers as Stateless:
To understand this concept think of your servers like a herd of cows and you care about how many gallons of milk you get every day.
If one day you notice that you‚Äôre getting less milk from a cow then you just need to replace that cow (producing less milk) with another cow.
You don‚Äôt need to be dependent on a specific cow to get the required amount of milk. We can relate the above example to our application.
The idea is to design the service in such a way that if one of the endpoints is giving the error or if it‚Äôs not serving the request in a timely fashion then you can switch to another server and get your work done.

It includes a lot of powerful and flexible toolkits to display, monitor, and analyze the result.
Chukwe collects the events from different parts of the system and from Chukwe you can do monitoring and analysis or you can use the dashboard to view the events.
Chukwe writes the event in the Hadoop file sequence format (S3). After that Big Data team processes these S3 Hadoop files and writes Hive in Parquet data format.
This process is called batch processing which basically scans the whole data at the hourly or daily frequency.
To upload online events to EMR/S3, Chukwa also provide traffic to Kafka (the main gate in real-time data processing).

Is there any mention of using a service mesh only if needed ?,"ev-cache

To solve this problem Netflix has built its own custom caching layer called EV cache. EV cache is based on Memcached and it is actually a wrapper around Memcached.

Netflix divided the data into two parts:

Live Viewing History (LiveVH):
This section included the small number of recent viewing historical data of users with frequent updates. The data is frequently used for the ETL jobs and stored in uncompressed form.
Compressed Viewing History (CompressedVH):
A large amount of older viewing records with rare updates is categorized in this section. The data is stored in a single column per row key, also in compressed form to reduce the storage footprin",7.79751181602478," Judgement and Explanation for Question 1 (Related technology/green practice): Yes. The context mentions Hystrix library which adds latency tolerance, fault-tolerant logic to control interactions between distributed services in Netflix's system design document when dealing with cache clients on EC2 instances using Memcached as a custom caching layer called EV Cache for efficiency and reliability purposes; this indicates that the use of Hystrix library is conditional upon needing fault tolerance.
Judgement: Yes, but not directly related to green practices or service mesh concepts mentioned in Question 3 (Need-based usage). However it can be inferred as a necessary component for ensuring system reliability and efficiency which indirectly supports sustainable operations within the software infrastructure by reducing unnecessary resource utilization due its fault tolerance properties.
Explanation: The Hystrix library is used in Netflix's design to manage latency-tolerant, distributed services interactions with cache clients on EC2 instances using Memcached (EV Cache). It isolates access points between the service and remote systems/libraries for fault tolerance. While not explicitly mentioned as a green practice or conditional upon needing one in this context alone; its role contributes to overall system efficiency, which can be seen indirectly supporting sustainable operations by minimizing resource waste due it's ability of reducing unnecessary data fetches and recomputations through latency tolerance.
Judgement for Question 3: No (Not Applicability). The context provided does not discuss the use or non-use a service mesh, nor is there any mention that its usage should be conditional upon needing one; thus based on this specific excerpt from Netflix's design document it cannot confirm if they employ such practices.

Metadata information from the previously watched videos for a user such as titles, genre, categories, actors, release year, etc.
The device of the user, at what time a user is more active, and for how long a user is active.
Netflix uses two different algorithms to build a recommendation system‚Ä¶

The idea of this filtering is that if two users have similar rating histories then they will behave similarly in the future.
For example, consider there are two-person. One person liked the movie and rated the movie with a good score.

It includes a lot of powerful and flexible toolkits to display, monitor, and analyze the result.
Chukwe collects the events from different parts of the system and from Chukwe you can do monitoring and analysis or you can use the dashboard to view the events.
Chukwe writes the event in the Hadoop file sequence format (S3). After that Big Data team processes these S3 Hadoop files and writes Hive in Parquet data format.
This process is called batch processing which basically scans the whole data at the hourly or daily frequency.
To upload online events to EMR/S3, Chukwa also provide traffic to Kafka (the main gate in real-time data processing).
