The following methods aren’t required to override to have a functional Airflow auth manager. However, it is recommended to override these to make your auth manager faster (and potentially less costly):

batch_is_authorized_dag: Batch version of is_authorized_dag. If not overridden, it will call is_authorized_dag for every single item.

you can set xcom_objectstorage_compression to fsspec supported compression methods like zip or snappy to compress the data before storing it in object storage.

Re-run DAG
There can be cases where you will want to execute your DAG again. One such case is when the scheduled DAG run fails.

Catchup
An Airflow DAG defined with a start_date, possibly an end_date, and a non-dataset schedule, defines a series of intervals which the scheduler turns into individual DAG runs and executes. The scheduler, by default, will kick off a DAG Run for any data interval that has not been run since the last data interval (or has been cleared). This concept is called Catchup.

Note

SubDAG is deprecated hence TaskGroup is always the preferred choice.

Sometimes, you will find that you are regularly adding exactly the same set of tasks to every DAG, or you want to group a lot of tasks into a single, logical unit. This is what SubDAGs are for.

For example, here’s a DAG that has a lot of parallel tasks in two sections:

SubDAGs
Note

SubDAG is deprecated hence TaskGroup is always the preferred choice.

Sometimes, you will find that you are regularly adding exactly the same set of tasks to every DAG, or you want to group a lot of tasks into a single, logical unit. This is what SubDAGs are for.

For example, here’s a DAG that has a lot of parallel tasks in two sections:

We can combine all of the parallel task-* operators into a single SubDAG, so that the resulting DAG resembles the following:

If you want to implement your own backend, you should subclass BaseXCom, and override the serialize_value and deserialize_value methods.

There is also an orm_deserialize_value method that is called whenever the XCom objects are rendered for UI or reporting purposes; if you have large or expensive-to-retrieve values in your XComs, you should override this method to avoid calling that code (and instead return a lighter, incomplete representation) so the UI remains responsive.

SubDAGs
Note

SubDAG is deprecated hence TaskGroup is always the preferred choice.

Sometimes, you will find that you are regularly adding exactly the same set of tasks to every DAG, or you want to group a lot of tasks into a single, logical unit. This is what SubDAGs are for.

For example, here’s a DAG that has a lot of parallel tasks in two sections:

../_images/subdag_before.png
We can combine all of the parallel task-* operators into a single SubDAG, so that the resulting DAG resembles the following:

---

you can set xcom_objectstorage_compression to fsspec supported compression methods like zip or snappy to compress the data before storing it in object storage.

---

user: The user trying to access the resource.

These authorization methods are:

is_authorized_configuration: Return whether the user is authorized to access Airflow configuration. Some details about the configuration can be provided (e.g. the config section).

is_authorized_connection: Return whether the user is authorized to access Airflow connections. Some details about the connection can be provided (e.g. the connection ID).

---

is_authorized_dag: Return whether the user is authorized to access a DAG. Some details about the DAG can be provided (e.g. the DAG ID). Also, is_authorized_dag is called for any entity related to DAGs (e.g. task instances, dag runs, …). This information is passed in access_entity. Example: auth_manager.is_authorized_dag(method=""GET"", access_entity=DagAccessEntity.Run, details=DagDetails(id=""dag-1"")) asks whether the user has permission to read the Dag runs of the dag “dag-1”.

If you want to implement your own backend, you should subclass BaseXCom, and override the serialize_value and deserialize_value methods.

There is also an orm_deserialize_value method that is called whenever the XCom objects are rendered for UI or reporting purposes; if you have large or expensive-to-retrieve values in your XComs, you should override this method to avoid calling that code (and instead return a lighter, incomplete representation) so the UI remains responsive.

You can also override the clear method and use it when clearing results for given DAGs and tasks. This allows the custom XCom backend to process the data lifecycle easier.

Of course, as you develop out your DAGs they are going to get increasingly complex, so we provide a few ways to modify these DAG views to make them easier to understand.

TaskGroups
A TaskGroup can be used to organize tasks into hierarchical groups in Graph view. It is useful for creating repeating patterns and cutting down visual clutter.

Unlike SubDAGs, TaskGroups are purely a UI grouping concept. Tasks in TaskGroups live on the same original DAG, and honor all the DAG settings and pool configurations.

Optional methods recommended to override for optimization
The following methods aren’t required to override to have a functional Airflow auth manager. However, it is recommended to override these to make your auth manager faster (and potentially less costly):

batch_is_authorized_dag: Batch version of is_authorized_dag. If not overridden, it will call is_authorized_dag for every single item.

batch_is_authorized_connection: Batch version of is_authorized_connection. If not overridden, it will call is_authorized_connection for every single item.

batch_is_authorized_pool: Batch version of is_authorized_pool. If not overridden, it will call is_authorized_pool for every single item.

---

user: The user trying to access the resource.

These authorization methods are:

is_authorized_configuration: Return whether the user is authorized to access Airflow configuration. Some details about the configuration can be provided (e.g. the config section).

is_authorized_connection: Return whether the user is authorized to access Airflow connections. Some details about the connection can be provided (e.g. the connection ID).

---

Re-run DAG
There can be cases where you will want to execute your DAG again. One such case is when the scheduled DAG run fails.

Catchup
An Airflow DAG defined with a start_date, possibly an end_date, and a non-dataset schedule, defines a series of intervals which the scheduler turns into individual DAG runs and executes. The scheduler, by default, will kick off a DAG Run for any data interval that has not been run since the last data interval (or has been cleared). This concept is called Catchup.

Explanation: The context provided does not mention anything about transport layer security (TLS) or its offloading to a border gateway for performance improvement. It discusses object storage compression and optimization methods, as well as Airflow authentication/authorization mechanisms but nothing related to TLS processing techniques mentioned in the question.

### Input:
To create an instruction similar to the given one with additional constraints (e.g., specifying a different technology or green practice), let's consider this context and formulate another software development-related inquiry, adhering strictly to your format request. I will provide you immediately following my query for its response based on the provided text snippet alone without making assumptions beyond it.

### Your Task:
Given a design document excerpt about an application's data handling and storage strategy involving object store interaction with compression, analyze if this setup inherently supports energy-efficient practices by leveraging hardware acceleration for compressing/decompressing operations as part of its protocol stack. If not explicitly stated or implied within the context that such a feature is implemented to enhance green computing initiatives directly through reducing processing overhead on compute resources (like CPU and GPU), your answer must reflect this assessment strictly in terms of hardware acceleration for compression tasks, following our specific format:

Of course, as you develop out your DAGs they are going to get increasingly complex, so we provide a few ways to modify these DAG views to make them easier to understand.

TaskGroups
A TaskGroup can be used to organize tasks into hierarchical groups in Graph view. It is useful for creating repeating patterns and cutting down visual clutter.

Unlike SubDAGs, TaskGroups are purely a UI grouping concept. Tasks in TaskGroups live on the same original DAG, and honor all the DAG settings and pool configurations.

Catchup
An Airflow DAG defined with a start_date, possibly an end_date, and a non-dataset schedule, defines a series of intervals which the scheduler turns into individual DAG runs and executes. The scheduler, by default, will kick off a DAG Run for any data interval that has not been run since the last data interval (or has been cleared). This concept is called Catchup.

Those DAG Runs will all have been started on the same actual day, but each DAG run will have one data interval covering a single day in that 3 month period, and that data interval is all the tasks, operators and sensors inside the DAG look at when they run.

SubDAGs
Note

SubDAG is deprecated hence TaskGroup is always the preferred choice.

Sometimes, you will find that you are regularly adding exactly the same set of tasks to every DAG, or you want to group a lot of tasks into a single, logical unit. This is what SubDAGs are for.

For example, here’s a DAG that has a lot of parallel tasks in two sections:

We can combine all of the parallel task-* operators into a single SubDAG, so that the resulting DAG resembles the following:

From the start of the first execution, till it eventually succeeds (i.e. after the file ‘root/test’ appears), the sensor is allowed maximum 3600 seconds as defined by timeout. In other words, if the file does not appear on the SFTP server within 3600 seconds, the sensor will raise AirflowSensorTimeout. It will not retry when this error is raised.

If the sensor fails due to other reasons such as network outages during the 3600 seconds interval, it can retry up to 2 times as defined by retries. Retrying does not reset the timeout. It will still have up to 3600 seconds in total for it to succeed.

From the start of the first execution, till it eventually succeeds (i.e. after the file ‘root/test’ appears), the sensor is allowed maximum 3600 seconds as defined by timeout. In other words, if the file does not appear on the SFTP server within 3600 seconds, the sensor will raise AirflowSensorTimeout. It will not retry when this error is raised.

If the sensor fails due to other reasons such as network outages during the 3600 seconds interval, it can retry up to 2 times as defined by retries. Retrying does not reset the timeout. It will still have up to 3600 seconds in total for it to succeed.

SubDAGs
Note

SubDAG is deprecated hence TaskGroup is always the preferred choice.

Sometimes, you will find that you are regularly adding exactly the same set of tasks to every DAG, or you want to group a lot of tasks into a single, logical unit. This is what SubDAGs are for.

For example, here’s a DAG that has a lot of parallel tasks in two sections:

../_images/subdag_before.png
We can combine all of the parallel task-* operators into a single SubDAG, so that the resulting DAG resembles the following:

Also, is_authorized_dag is called for any entity related to DAGs (e.g. task instances, dag runs, …). This information is passed in access_entity. Example: auth_manager.is_authorized_dag(method=""GET"", access_entity=DagAccessEntity.Run, details=DagDetails(id=""dag-1"")) asks whether the user has permission to read the Dag runs of the dag “dag-1”.

There is also an orm_deserialize_value method that is called whenever the XCom objects are rendered for UI or reporting purposes; if you have large or expensive-to-retrieve values in your XComs, you should override this method to avoid calling that code (and instead return a lighter, incomplete representation) so the UI remains responsive.

In the case of a distributed deployment, it is important to consider the security aspects of the components. The webserver does not have access to the DAG files directly. The code in the Code tab of the UI is read from the metadata database. The webserver cannot execute any code submitted by the DAG author. It can only execute code that is installed as an installed package or plugin by the Deployment Manager.

SubDAGs
Note

SubDAG is deprecated hence TaskGroup is always the preferred choice.

Sometimes, you will find that you are regularly adding exactly the same set of tasks to every DAG, or you want to group a lot of tasks into a single, logical unit. This is what SubDAGs are for.

For example, here’s a DAG that has a lot of parallel tasks in two sections:

We can combine all of the parallel task-* operators into a single SubDAG, so that the resulting DAG resembles the following:

Note

SubDAG is deprecated hence TaskGroup is always the preferred choice.

Sometimes, you will find that you are regularly adding exactly the same set of tasks to every DAG, or you want to group a lot of tasks into a single, logical unit. This is what SubDAGs are for.

For example, here’s a DAG that has a lot of parallel tasks in two sections:

SubDAGs
Note

SubDAG is deprecated hence TaskGroup is always the preferred choice.

Sometimes, you will find that you are regularly adding exactly the same set of tasks to every DAG, or you want to group a lot of tasks into a single, logical unit. This is what SubDAGs are for.

For example, here’s a DAG that has a lot of parallel tasks in two sections:

../_images/subdag_before.png
We can combine all of the parallel task-* operators into a single SubDAG, so that the resulting DAG resembles the following:

From the start of the first execution, till it eventually succeeds (i.e. after the file ‘root/test’ appears), the sensor is allowed maximum 3600 seconds as defined by timeout. In other words, if the file does not appear on the SFTP server within 3600 seconds, the sensor will raise AirflowSensorTimeout. It will not retry when this error is raised.

If the sensor fails due to other reasons such as network outages during the 3600 seconds interval, it can retry up to 2 times as defined by retries. Retrying does not reset the timeout. It will still have up to 3600 seconds in total for it to succeed.

Note

SubDAG is deprecated hence TaskGroup is always the preferred choice.

Sometimes, you will find that you are regularly adding exactly the same set of tasks to every DAG, or you want to group a lot of tasks into a single, logical unit. This is what SubDAGs are for.

For example, here’s a DAG that has a lot of parallel tasks in two sections:

../_images/subdag_before.png
We can combine all of the parallel task-* operators into a single SubDAG, so that the resulting DAG resembles the following:

---

---

Also, is_authorized_dag is called for any entity related to DAGs (e.g. task instances, dag runs, …). This information is passed in access_entity.

Re-run DAG
There can be cases where you will want to execute your DAG again. One such case is when the scheduled DAG run fails.

Catchup
An Airflow DAG defined with a start_date, possibly an end_date, and a non-dataset schedule, defines a series of intervals which the scheduler turns into individual DAG runs and executes. The scheduler, by default, will kick off a DAG Run for any data interval that has not been run since the last data interval (or has been cleared). This concept is called Catchup.

SubDAGs
Note

SubDAG is deprecated hence TaskGroup is always the preferred choice.

Sometimes, you will find that you are regularly adding exactly the same set of tasks to every DAG, or you want to group a lot of tasks into a single, logical unit. This is what SubDAGs are for.

For example, here’s a DAG that has a lot of parallel tasks in two sections:

../_images/subdag_before.png
We can combine all of the parallel task-* operators into a single SubDAG, so that the resulting DAG resembles the following:

---

user: The user trying to access the resource.

is_authorized_configuration: Return whether the user is authorized to access Airflow configuration. Some details about the configuration can be provided (e.g. the config section).

is_authorized_connection: Return whether the user is authorized to access Airflow connections. Some details about the connection can be provided (e.g. the connection ID).

---

If you want to implement your own backend, you should subclass BaseXCom, and override the serialize_value and deserialize_value methods.

There is also an orm_deserialize_value method that is called whenever the XCom objects are rendered for UI or reporting purposes; if you have large or expensive-to-retrieve values in your XComs, you should override this method to avoid calling that code (and instead return a lighter, incomplete representation) so the UI remains responsive.

You can also override the clear method and use it when clearing results for given DAGs and tasks. This allows the custom XCom backend to process the data lifecycle easier.

Re-run DAG
There can be cases where you will want to execute your DAG again. One such case is when the scheduled DAG run fails.

Catchup
An Airflow DAG defined with a start_date, possibly an end_date, and a non-dataset schedule, defines a series of intervals which the scheduler turns into individual DAG runs and executes. The scheduler, by default, will kick off a DAG Run for any data interval that has not been run since the last data interval (or has been cleared). This concept is called Catchup.

Re-run DAG
There can be cases where you will want to execute your DAG again. One such case is when the scheduled DAG run fails.

Catchup
An Airflow DAG defined with a start_date, possibly an end_date, and a non-dataset schedule, defines a series of intervals which the scheduler turns into individual DAG runs and executes. The scheduler, by default, will kick off a DAG Run for any data interval that has not been run since the last data interval (or has been cleared). This concept is called Catchup.

---

In the case of a distributed deployment, it is important to consider the security aspects of the components. The webserver does not have access to the DAG files directly. The code in the Code tab of the UI is read from the metadata database. The webserver cannot execute any code submitted by the DAG author.

Re-run DAG
There can be cases where you will want to execute your DAG again. One such case is when the scheduled DAG run fails.

Catchup
An Airflow DAG defined with a start_date, possibly an end_date, and a non-dataset schedule, defines a series of intervals which the scheduler turns into individual DAG runs and executes. The scheduler, by default, will kick off a DAG Run for any data interval that has not been run since the last data interval (or has been cleared). This concept is called Catchup.

SubDAGs
Note

SubDAG is deprecated hence TaskGroup is always the preferred choice.

Sometimes, you will find that you are regularly adding exactly the same set of tasks to every DAG, or you want to group a lot of tasks into a single, logical unit. This is what SubDAGs are for.

For example, here’s a DAG that has a lot of parallel tasks in two sections:

../_images/subdag_before.png
We can combine all of the parallel task-* operators into a single SubDAG, so that the resulting DAG resembles the following:

---

user: The user trying to access the resource.

These authorization methods are:

is_authorized_configuration: Return whether the user is authorized to access Airflow configuration. Some details about the configuration can be provided (e.g. the config section).

is_authorized_connection: Return whether the user is authorized to access Airflow connections. Some details about the connection can be provided (e.g. the connection ID).

---

is_authorized_dag: Return whether the user is authorized to access a DAG. Some details about the DAG can be provided (e.g. the DAG ID). Also, is_authorized_dag is called for any entity related to DAGs (e.g. task instances, dag runs, …). This information is passed in access_entity. Example: auth_manager.is_authorized_dag(method=""GET"", access_entity=DagAccessEntity.Run, details=DagDetails(id=""dag-1"")) asks whether the user has permission to read the Dag runs of the dag “dag-1”.

is_authorized_dataset: Return whether the user is authorized to access Airflow datasets. Some details about the dataset can be provided (e.g. the dataset uri).

is_authorized_pool: Return whether the user is authorized to access Airflow pools. Some details about the pool can be provided (e.g. the pool name).

---

User interface
Airflow comes with a user interface that lets you see what DAGs and their tasks are doing, trigger runs of DAGs, view logs, and do some limited debugging and resolution of problems with your DAGs.

../_images/dags.png
It’s generally the best way to see the status of your Airflow installation as a whole, as well as diving into individual DAGs to see their layout, the status of each task, and the logs from each task.

SubDAGs
Note

SubDAG is deprecated hence TaskGroup is always the preferred choice.

Sometimes, you will find that you are regularly adding exactly the same set of tasks to every DAG, or you want to group a lot of tasks into a single, logical unit. This is what SubDAGs are for.

For example, here’s a DAG that has a lot of parallel tasks in two sections:

../_images/subdag_before.png
We can combine all of the parallel task-* operators into a single SubDAG, so that the resulting DAG resembles the following:

---

user: The user trying to access the resource.

These authorization methods are:

is_authorized_configuration: Return whether the user is authorized to access Airflow configuration. Some details about the configuration can be provided (e.g. the config section).

is_authorized_connection: Return whether the user is authorized to access Airflow connections. Some details about the connection can be provided (e.g. the connection ID).

---

is_authorized_dag: Return whether the user is authorized to access a DAG. Some details about the DAG can be provided (e.g. the DAG ID). Also, is_authorized_dag is called for any entity related to DAGs (e.g. task instances, dag runs, …). This information is passed in access_entity. Example: auth_manager.is_authorized_dag(method=""GET"", access_entity=DagAccessEntity.Run, details=DagDetails(id=""dag-1"")) asks whether the user has permission to read the Dag runs of the dag “dag-1”.

is_authorized_dataset: Return whether the user is authorized to access Airflow datasets. Some details about the dataset can be provided (e.g. the dataset uri).

In the case of a distributed deployment, it is important to consider the security aspects of the components. The webserver does not have access to the DAG files directly. The code in the Code tab of the UI is read from the metadata database. The webserver cannot execute any code submitted by the DAG author. It can only execute code that is installed as an installed package or plugin by the Deployment Manager. The Operations User only has access to the UI and can only trigger DAGs and tasks, but cannot author DAGs.

Re-run DAG
There can be cases where you will want to execute your DAG again. One such case is when the scheduled DAG run fails.

Catchup
An Airflow DAG defined with a start_date, possibly an end_date, and a non-dataset schedule, defines a series of intervals which the scheduler turns into individual DAG runs and executes. The scheduler, by default, will kick off a DAG Run for any data interval that has not been run since the last data interval (or has been cleared). This concept is called Catchup.

If you want to implement your own backend, you should subclass BaseXCom, and override the serialize_value and deserialize_value methods.

There is also an orm_deserialize_value method that is called whenever the XCom objects are rendered for UI or reporting purposes; if you have large or expensive-to-retrieve values in your XComs, you should override this method to avoid calling that code (and instead return a lighter, incomplete representation) so the UI remains responsive.

You can also override the clear method and use it when clearing results for given DAGs and tasks. This allows the custom XCom backend to process the data lifecycle easier.

SubDAGs
Note

SubDAG is deprecated hence TaskGroup is always the preferred choice.

Sometimes, you will find that you are regularly adding exactly the same set of tasks to every DAG, or you want to group a lot of tasks into a single, logical unit. This is what SubDAGs are for.

For example, here’s a DAG that has a lot of parallel tasks in two sections:

../_images/subdag_before.png
We can combine all of the parallel task-* operators into a single SubDAG, so that the resulting DAG resembles the following:

---

If you want to implement your own backend, you should subclass BaseXCom, and override the serialize_value and deserialize_value methods.

There is also an orm_deserialize_value method that is called whenever the XCom objects are rendered for UI or reporting purposes; if you have large or expensive-to-retrieve values in your XComs, you should override this method to avoid calling that code (and instead return a lighter, incomplete representation) so the UI remains responsive.

You can also override the clear method and use it when clearing results for given DAGs and tasks. This allows the custom XCom backend to process the data lifecycle easier.

SubDAGs
Note

SubDAG is deprecated hence TaskGroup is always the preferred choice.

Sometimes, you will find that you are regularly adding exactly the same set of tasks to every DAG, or you want to group a lot of tasks into a single, logical unit. This is what SubDAGs are for.

For example, here’s a DAG that has a lot of parallel tasks in two sections:

../_images/subdag_before.png
We can combine all of the parallel task-* operators into a single SubDAG, so that the resulting DAG resembles the following:

---

you can set xcom_objectstorage_compression to fsspec supported compression methods like zip or snappy to compress the data before storing it in object storage.

---

user: The user trying to access the resource.

These authorization methods are:

is_authorized_configuration: Return whether the user is authorized to access Airflow configuration. Some details about the configuration can be provided (e.g. the config section).

is_authorized_connection: Return whether the user is authorized to access Airflow connections. Some details about the connection can be provided (e.g. the connection ID).

---

is_authorized_dag: Return whether the user is authorized to access a DAG. Some details about the DAG can be provided (e.g. the DAG ID).

Example: auth_manager.is_authorized_dag(method=""GET"", access_entity=DagAccessEntity.Run, details=DagDetails(id=""dag-1"")) asks whether the user has permission to read the Dag runs of the dag “dag-1”.

Logging
Executors may vend log messages which will be included in the Airflow task logs by implementing the get_task_logs method. This can be helpful if the execution environment has extra context in the case of task failures, which may be due to the execution environment itself rather than the Airflow task code. It can also be helpful to include setup/teardown logging from the execution environment.

Re-run DAG
There can be cases where you will want to execute your DAG again. One such case is when the scheduled DAG run fails.

Catchup
An Airflow DAG defined with a start_date, possibly an end_date, and a non-dataset schedule, defines a series of intervals which the scheduler turns into individual DAG runs and executes. The scheduler, by default, will kick off a DAG Run for any data interval that has not been run since the last data interval (or has been cleared). This concept is called Catchup.

Re-run DAG
There can be cases where you will want to execute your DAG again. One such case is when the scheduled DAG run fails.

Catchup
An Airflow DAG defined with a start_date, possibly an end_date, and a non-dataset schedule, defines a series of intervals which the scheduler turns into individual DAG runs and executes. The scheduler, by default, will kick off a DAG Run for any data interval that has not been run since the last data interval (or has been cleared). This concept is called Catchup.

All dates in Airflow are tied to the data interval concept in some way. The “logical date” (also called execution_date in Airflow versions prior to 2.2) of a DAG run, for example, denotes the start of the data interval, not when the DAG is actually executed.

Similarly, since the start_date argument for the DAG and its tasks points to the same logical date, it marks the start of the DAG’s first data interval, not when tasks in the DAG will start running. In other words, a DAG run will only be scheduled one interval after start_date.

Re-run DAG
There can be cases where you will want to execute your DAG again. One such case is when the scheduled DAG run fails.

Catchup
An Airflow DAG defined with a start_date, possibly an end_date, and a non-dataset schedule, defines a series of intervals which the scheduler turns into individual DAG runs and executes. The scheduler, by default, will kick off a DAG Run for any data interval that has not been run since the last data interval (or has been cleared). This concept is called Catchup.

Running DAGs
DAGs will run in one of two ways:

On a defined schedule, which is defined as part of the DAG

DAGs do not require a schedule, but it’s very common to define one. You define it via the schedule argument, like this:

with DAG(""my_daily_dag"", schedule=""@daily""):
    ...
There are various valid values for the schedule argument:

SubDAGs
Note

SubDAG is deprecated hence TaskGroup is always the preferred choice.

Sometimes, you will find that you are regularly adding exactly the same set of tasks to every DAG, or you want to group a lot of tasks into a single, logical unit. This is what SubDAGs are for.

For example, here’s a DAG that has a lot of parallel tasks in two sections:

../_images/subdag_before.png
We can combine all of the parallel task-* operators into a single SubDAG, so that the resulting DAG resembles the following:

---

user: The user trying to access the resource.

These authorization methods are:

is_authorized_configuration: Return whether the user is authorized to access Airflow configuration. Some details about the configuration can be provided (e.g. the config section).

is_authorized_connection: Return whether the user is authorized to access Airflow connections. Some details about the connection can be provided (e.g. the connection ID).

---

is_authorized_dag: Return whether the user is authorized to access a DAG. Some details about the DAG can be provided (e.g. the DAG ID). Also, is_authorized_dag is called for any entity related to DAGs (e.g. task instances, dag runs, …). This information is passed in access_entity. Example: auth_manager.is_authorized_dag(method=""GET"", access_entity=DagAccessEntity.Run, details=DagDetails(id=""dag-1"")) asks whether the user has permission to read the Dag runs of the dag “dag-1”.

is_authorized_dataset: Return whether the user is authorized to access Airflow datasets. Some details about the dataset can be provided (e.g. the dataset uri).

is_authorized_pool: Return whether the user is authorized to access Airflow pools. Some details about the pool can be provided (e.g. the pool name).

---

All dates in Airflow are tied to the data interval concept in some way. The “logical date” (also called execution_date in Airflow versions prior to 2.2) of a DAG run, for example, denotes the start of the data interval, not when the DAG is actually executed.

Similarly, since the start_date argument for the DAG and its tasks points to the same logical date, it marks the start of the DAG’s first data interval, not when tasks in the DAG will start running. In other words, a DAG run will only be scheduled one interval after start_date.

Tip

If a cron expression or timedelta object is not enough to express your DAG’s schedule, logical date, or data interval, see Timetables. For more information on logical date, see Running DAGs and What does execution_date mean?",2.420793294906616," Judgement: Not Applicable

Re-run DAG
There can be cases where you will want to execute your DAG again. One such case is when the scheduled DAG run fails.

Catchup
An Airflow DAG defined with a start_date, possibly an end_date, and a non-dataset schedule, defines a series of intervals which the scheduler turns into individual DAG runs and executes.
