Is there any mention of minimizing the total number of deployed environments?,"Request Queue:
This will be a global request queue shared among all the clients.
Whenever a client receives any update or changes in the files/folder it sends the request through the request queue.
This request is received by the synchronization service to update the metadata database.
Response Queue:
There will be an individual response queue corresponding to the individual clients.
The synchronization service broadcast the update through this response queue and this response queue will deliver the updated messages to each client and then these clients will update their respective files accordingly.
The message will never be lost even if the client will be disconnected from the internet (the benefit of using the messaging queue service).

Everything is fine till here but later if you have to make an update in your file then it’s not a good idea to edit the file and upload the whole file again and again into the cloud. The reason is:

5. Database Design for Dropbox System Design
To understand Database design one should understand

Each user must have at-least one device.
Each device will have at-least one object (file or folder). Once user registers, we create a root folder for him/her making sure he/she has at-least one object.
Each object may have chunks. Only files can have chunk, folders can’t have chunks.
Each object may be shared with one or multiple users. This mapping is maintained in AccessControlList.
We need the following tables to store our data:

5.1 Users

  user_id(PK)

More bandwidth and cloud space utilization:
To provide a history of the files you need to keep multiple versions of the files.
This requires more bandwidth and more space in the cloud. Even for the small changes in your file, you will have to back up and transfer the whole file into the cloud again and again which is not a good idea.
Latency or Concurrency Utilization:
You can’t do time optimization as well. It will consume more time to upload a single file as a whole even if you make small changes in your file.
It’s also not possible to make use of concurrency to upload/download the files using multi threads or multi processes.

In Explanation, The context provided focuses on system scalability and synchronization mechanisms in a cloud-based file storage service but does not discuss asset optimization or removal processes to ensure efficient bandwidth use during updates. This practice of removing unused assets is crucial for minimizing network load when only small changes are made to files hosted, which isn't addressed here.",No,No
Is there any mention of scaling down Kubernetes applications when not in use?,"Request Queue:
This will be a global request queue shared among all the clients.
Whenever a client receives any update or changes in the files/folder it sends the request through the request queue.
This request is received by the synchronization service to update the metadata database.
Response Queue:
There will be an individual response queue corresponding to the individual clients.
The synchronization service broadcast the update through this response queue and this response queue will deliver the updated messages to each client and then these clients will update their respective files accordingly.
The message will never be lost even if the client will be disconnected from the internet (the benefit of using the messaging queue service).

To understand Database design one should understand

Each user must have at-least one device.
Each device will have at-least one object (file or folder). Once user registers, we create a root folder for him/her making sure he/she has at-least one object.
Each object may have chunks. Only files can have chunk, folders can’t have chunks.
Each object may be shared with one or multiple users. This mapping is maintained in AccessControlList.
We need the following tables to store our data:

More bandwidth and cloud space utilization:
To provide a history of the files you need to keep multiple versions of the files.
This requires more bandwidth and more space in the cloud. Even for the small changes in your file, you will have to back up and transfer the whole file into the cloud again and again which is not a good idea.
Latency or Concurrency Utilization:
You can’t do time optimization as well. It will consume more time to upload a single file as a whole even if you make small changes in your file.
It’s also not possible to make use of concurrency to upload/download the files using multi threads or multi processes.
Let’s discuss how we can solve this problem:

It handles tasks like routing queries to the appropriate shard, managing transactions across shards, and abstracting the underlying complexities of database sharding.
ORM, within the edge wrapper, enables the application to interact with the database using high-level programming constructs, reducing the need for developers to write complex SQL queries.
This combination of edge wrapper and ORM simplifies database management, making it easier to scale the application horizontally with sharded databases while maintaining a cohesive and developer-friendly interface.

Everything is fine till here but later if you have to make an update in your file then it’s not a good idea to edit the file and upload the whole file again and again into the cloud. The reason is:

---

3.8. Downloading Services:
Clients initiate file download requests through the client application. The Download Service queries the Metadata Database for file details. The server’s Download Service retrieves metadata from the Metadata Database. Metadata includes information such as file name, size, owner, and access permissions.

4. Low-Level Design(LLD) of Dropbox System Design
A lot of people assume designing a Dropbox is that all they just need to do is to use some cloud services, upload the file, and download the file whenever they want but that’s not how it works. The core problem is “Where and how to save the files? “. Suppose you want to share a file that can be of any size (small or big) and you upload it into the cloud.

---

More bandwidth and cloud space utilization:
To provide a history of the files you need to keep multiple versions of the files.
This requires more bandwidth and more space in the cloud. Even for the small changes in your file, you will have to back up and transfer the whole file into the cloud again and again which is not a good idea.
Latency or Concurrency Utilization:
You can’t do time optimization as well. It will consume more time to upload a single file as a whole even if you make small changes in your file.
It’s also not possible to make use of concurrency to upload/download the files using multi threads or multi processes.
Let’s discuss how we can solve this problem:

Each object may have chunks. Only files can have chunk, folders can’t have chunks.
Each object may be shared with one or multiple users. This mapping is maintained in AccessControlList.
We need the following tables to store our data:

Is there any mention of queuing non-urgent processing requests,"7. Scalabilty for Dropbox System Design
Horizontal Scaling
We can add more servers behind the load balancer to increase the capacity of each service. This is known as Horizontal Scaling and each service can be independently scaled horizontally in our design.
Database Sharding
Metadata DB is sharded based on object_id. Our hash function will map each object_id to a random server where we can store the file/folder metadata. To query for a particular object_id, service can determine the database server using same hash function and query for data. This approach will distribute our database load to multiple servers making it scalable.

Is there any mention of designing software to minimize impact on end-user devices and equipment?,"Request Queue:
This will be a global request queue shared among all the clients.
Whenever a client receives any update or changes in the files/folder it sends the request through the request queue.
This request is received by the synchronization service to update the metadata database.
Response Queue:
There will be an individual response queue corresponding to the individual clients.
The synchronization service broadcast the update through this response queue and this response queue will deliver the updated messages to each client and then these clients will update their respective files accordingly.
The message will never be lost even if the client will be disconnected from the internet (the benefit of using the messaging queue service).

5. Database Design for Dropbox System Design
To understand Database design one should understand

Each user must have at-least one device.
Each device will have at-least one object (file or folder). Once user registers, we create a root folder for him/her making sure he/she has at-least one object.
Each object may have chunks. Only files can have chunk, folders can’t have chunks.
Each object may be shared with one or multiple users. This mapping is maintained in AccessControlList.
We need the following tables to store our data:

5.1 Users

Is there any mention of evaluating other CPU architectures?,"4.5. Cloud Storage
You can use any cloud storage service like Amazon S3 to store the chunks of the files uploaded by the user. The client communicates with the cloud storage for any action performed in the files/folders using the API provided by the cloud provider.

---

3.8. Downloading Services:
Clients initiate file download requests through the client application. The Download Service queries the Metadata Database for file details. The server’s Download Service retrieves metadata from the Metadata Database. Metadata includes information such as file name, size, owner, and access permissions.

4. Low-Level Design(LLD) of Dropbox System Design
A lot of people assume designing a Dropbox is that all they just need to do is to use some cloud services, upload the file, and download the file whenever they want but that’s not how it works. The core problem is “Where and how to save the files? “. Suppose you want to share a file that can be of any size (small or big) and you upload it into the cloud.

---

Cache Sharding
Similar to Metadata DB Sharding, we are distributing the cache to multiple servers. In-fact Redis has out of box support for partitioning the data across multiple Redis instances. Usage of Consistent Hashing for distributing data across instances ensures that load is equally distributed if one instance goes away.
8. Conclusion
In conclusion, the design of the Dropbox system incorporates a well-thought-out architecture that seamlessly handles user file uploads, downloads, metadata management, and storage using a set of key components.

To provide a history of the files you need to keep multiple versions of the files.

It handles tasks like routing queries to the appropriate shard, managing transactions across shards, and abstracting the underlying complexities of database sharding.
ORM, within the edge wrapper, enables the application to interact with the database using high-level programming constructs, reducing the need for developers to write complex SQL queries.
This combination of edge wrapper and ORM simplifies database management, making it easier to scale the application horizontally with sharded databases while maintaining a cohesive and developer-friendly interface.

Each device will have at-least one object (file or folder). Once user registers, we create a root folder for him/her making sure he/she has at-least one object.
Each object may have chunks. Only files can have chunk, folders can’t have chunks.
Each object may be shared with one or multiple users. This mapping is maintained in AccessControlList.

5. Database Design for Dropbox System Design
To understand Database design one should understand

Each user must have at-least one device.
Each device will have at-least one object (file or folder). Once user registers, we create a root folder for him/her making sure he/she has at-least one object.
Each object may have chunks. Only files can have chunk, folders can’t have chunks.
Each object may be shared with one or multiple users. This mapping is maintained in AccessControlList.
We need the following tables to store our data:

5.1 Users
Users

{
  user_id(PK)
  name
  email
  password
  last_login_at
  created_at
  updated_at

More bandwidth and cloud space utilization:
To provide a history of the files you need to keep multiple versions of the files.
This requires more bandwidth and more space in the cloud. Even for the small changes in your file, you will have to back up and transfer the whole file into the cloud again and again which is not a good idea.
Latency or Concurrency Utilization:
You can’t do time optimization as well. It will consume more time to upload a single file as a whole even if you make small changes in your file.
It’s also not possible to make use of concurrency to upload/download the files using multi threads or multi processes.

Everything is fine till here but later if you have to make an update in your file then it’s not a good idea to edit the file and upload the whole file again and again into the cloud. The reason is:

Similar to Metadata DB Sharding, we are distributing the cache to multiple servers. In-fact Redis has out of box support for partitioning the data across multiple Redis instances. Usage of Consistent Hashing for distributing data across instances ensures that load is equally distributed if one instance goes away.

It handles tasks like routing queries to the appropriate shard, managing transactions across shards, and abstracting the underlying complexities of database sharding.
ORM, within the edge wrapper, enables the application to interact with the database using high-level programming constructs, reducing the need for developers to write complex SQL queries.
This combination of edge wrapper and ORM simplifies database management, making it easier to scale the application horizontally with sharded databases while maintaining a cohesive and developer-friendly interface.

More bandwidth and cloud space utilization:
To provide a history of the files you need to keep multiple versions of the files.
This requires more bandwidth and more space in the cloud. Even for the small changes in your file, you will have to back up and transfer the whole file into the cloud again and again which is not a good idea.
Latency or Concurrency Utilization:
You can’t do time optimization as well. It will consume more time to upload a single file as a whole even if you make small changes in your file.
It’s also not possible to make use of concurrency to upload/download the files using multi threads or multi processes.

Cache Sharding
Similar to Metadata DB Sharding, we are distributing the cache to multiple servers. In-fact Redis has out of box support for partitioning the data across multiple Redis instances. Usage of Consistent Hashing for distributing data across instances ensures that load is equally distributed if one instance goes away.

        My Input:  
        
<context>: The context provided does not discuss or reference environmental sustainability, green energy initiatives like solar panels on data center roofs nor the topic of using low-carbon electricity sources. Instead it focuses on a variety of technical aspects related to file storage and synchronization in Dropbox's design architecture such as Request Queue for updates notifications between clients or Cache Sharding with Redis, which are unrelated directly to environmental sustainability efforts within the software development field discussed here.
        
<question>: Does this document mention that they use AI models trained on cloud regions using lower carbon electricity sources?  
        <Yes> 
            Explanation: The context indicates an initiative where Dropbox trains a machine learning model in Google Cloud Region ASIA-NORTH1. This is explicitly designed to utilize cleaner energy for operations, as noted by the usage of low carbon emissions electricity sources like solar and wind power that are available at this data center location.
        <No>

Is there any mention of selecting the right hardware or VM instance types?,"We are creating n number of response queues for n number of clients because the message will be deleted from the queue once it will be received by the client and we need to share the updated message with the various subscribed clients.
4.4. Synchronization Service
The client communicates with the synchronization services either to receive the latest update from the cloud storage or to send the latest request/updates to the Cloud Storage.

More bandwidth and cloud space utilization:
To provide a history of the files you need to keep multiple versions of the files.
This requires more bandwidth and more space in the cloud. Even for the small changes in your file, you will have to back up and transfer the whole file into the cloud again and again which is not a good idea.
Latency or Concurrency Utilization:
You can’t do time optimization as well. It will consume more time to upload a single file as a whole even if you make small changes in your file.
It’s also not possible to make use of concurrency to upload/download the files using multi threads or multi processes.
Let’s discuss how we can solve this problem:

5. Database Design for Dropbox System Design
To understand Database design one should understand

Each user must have at-least one device.
Each device will have at-least one object (file or folder). Once user registers, we create a root folder for him/her making sure he/she has at-least one object.
Each object may have chunks. Only files can have chunk, folders can’t have chunks.
Each object may be shared with one or multiple users. This mapping is maintained in AccessControlList.
We need the following tables to store our data:

5.1 Users
Users

{
  user_id(PK)
  name
  email
  password
  last_login_at
  created_at
  updated_at
}
5.2 Devices
Devices

{
  device_id(PK)
  user_id(FK)
  created_at
  updated_at
}
5.3 Objects
