We need the following tables to store our data:

---

Availability: The system should be highly available.
Durability: Any uploaded content (photos and videos) should never get lost.
Consistency: We can compromise a little on consistency. It is acceptable if the content (photos or videos) takes time to show in followers’ feeds located in a distant region.
Reliability: The system must be able to tolerate hardware and software failures.

We have 1 billion users, with 500 million as daily active users. Assume 60 million photos and 35 million videos are shared on Instagram per day. We can consider 3 MB as the maximum size of each photo and 150 MB as the maximum size of each video uploaded on Instagram.On average, each user sends 20 requests (of any type) per day to our service.

3.1 Storage Per Day
Photos: 60 million photos/day * 3 MB = 180 TeraBytes / day
Videos: 35 million videos/day * 150 MB = 5250 TB / day
Total content size = 180 + 5250 = 5430 TB
The Total Space required for a Year:
5430 TB/day * 365 (days a year) = 1981950 TB = 1981.95 PetaBytes

3.2 Bandwidth Estimation
5430 TB/(24 * 60* 60) = 5430 TB/86400 sec ~= 62.84 GB/s ~= 502.8 Gbps

10. Scalability for Instagram System Design
Scalability refers to the ability of an organization (or a system, such as a computer network) to perform well under an increased or expanding workload. A system that scales well will be able to maintain or increase its level of performance even as it is tested by larger and larger operational demands.

We can add more servers to application service layers to make the scalability better and handle numerous requests from the clients. We can also increase the number of databases to store the growing users’ data.

In this article we have discussed about instagram design in which how discussed about the save post and videos, like and dislike the post, show feeds, posting the post or videos, how we can put the hashtags. nstagram’s system design is a complex and sophisticated architecture that prioritizes scalability, availability, security, and user experience.

        In Explanation, Asynchronous network calls are not explicitly mentioned in your design context. All API interactions appear to be handled synchronously as they involve direct requests and responses within the service layers for operations like posting a photo or video content on Instagram. This approach can potentially lead to higher latency if there is high user traffic since each request requires waiting before receiving data, unlike asynchronous calls that allow other processes to continue while awaiting response from network services.",22.952577829360962,0,"[Document(page_content='API Endpoints:\n\nGET /posts/{post_id}: Retrieves details of a post, including the number of likes/dislikes.\nPOST /posts/{post_id}/like: Registers a like for the post by the authenticated user.\nPOST /posts/{post_id}/dislike: Registers a dislike for the post by the authenticated user.\nDELETE /posts/{post_id}/like: Removes the like for the post by the authenticated user (if previously done).\nDELETE /posts/{post_id}/dislike: Removes the dislike for the post by the authenticated user (if previously done).', metadata={'id': 'documentsFromText/Instagram/content.txt:None:19', 'source': 'documentsFromText/Instagram/content.txt'}), Document(page_content='Microservices – also known as the microservice architecture – is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of services that are:\n\nIndependently deployable\nLoosely coupled\nOrganized around business capabilities\nOwned by a small team\nThe microservice architecture enables an organization to deliver large, complex applications rapidly, frequently, reliably and sustainably – a necessity for competing and winning in today’s world.', metadata={'id': 'documentsFromText/Instagram/content.txt:None:24', 'source': 'documentsFromText/Instagram/content.txt'}), Document(page_content='10.

3.1 Storage Per Day
Photos: 60 million photos/day * 3 MB = 180 TeraBytes / day
Videos: 35 million videos/day * 150 MB = 5250 TB / day
Total content size = 180 + 5250 = 5430 TB
The Total Space required for a Year:
5430 TB/day * 365 (days a year) = 1981950 TB = 1981.95 PetaBytes

3.2 Bandwidth Estimation
5430 TB/(24 * 60* 60) = 5430 TB/86400 sec ~= 62.84 GB/s ~= 502.8 Gbps
Incoming bandwidth ~= 502.8 Gbps
Let’s say the ratio of readers to writers is 100:1.
Required outgoing bandwidth ~= 100 * 502.8 Gbps ~= 50.28 Tbps

response_like = requests.post(url_like, headers=headers)
 
# Unlike a post
response_unlike = requests.delete(url_unlike, headers=headers)
7.4 Search photos and videos

Feed Generation adjusts based on changed relationships.
User monitors activity:
Client checks notifications feed.
Notifications provide updates on relevant events.
Key Design Considerations:

---

Post photos and videos: The users can post photos and videos on Instagram.
Follow and unfollow users: The users can follow and unfollow other users on Instagram.
Like or dislike posts: The users can like or dislike posts of the accounts they follow.
Search photos and videos: The users can search photos and videos based on captions and location.
Generate news feed: The users can view the news feed consisting of the photos and videos (in chronological order) from all the users they follow.
2.2 Non-Functional requirements for Instagram System Design
Scalability: The system should be scalable to handle millions of users in terms of computational resources and storage.
Latency: The latency to generate a news feed should be low.
Availability: The system should be highly available.

Availability: The system should be highly available.
Durability: Any uploaded content (photos and videos) should never get lost.
Consistency: We can compromise a little on consistency. It is acceptable if the content (photos or videos) takes time to show in followers’ feeds located in a distant region.
Reliability: The system must be able to tolerate hardware and software failures.
3. Capacity Estimation for Instagram System Design
We have 1 billion users, with 500 million as daily active users. Assume 60 million photos and 35 million videos are shared on Instagram per day. We can consider 3 MB as the maximum size of each photo and 150 MB as the maximum size of each video uploaded on Instagram.On average, each user sends 20 requests (of any type) per day to our service.

Availability: The system should be highly available.
Durability: Any uploaded content (photos and videos) should never get lost.
Consistency: We can compromise a little on consistency. It is acceptable if the content (photos or videos) takes time to show in followers’ feeds located in a distant region.
Reliability: The system must be able to tolerate hardware and software failures.

We have 1 billion users, with 500 million as daily active users. Assume 60 million photos and 35 million videos are shared on Instagram per day. We can consider 3 MB as the maximum size of each photo and 150 MB as the maximum size of each video uploaded on Instagram.On average, each user sends 20 requests (of any type) per day to our service.

Feed Generation adjusts based on changed relationships.
User monitors activity:
Client checks notifications feed.
Notifications provide updates on relevant events.
Key Design Considerations:

---

Post photos and videos: The users can post photos and videos on Instagram.
Follow and unfollow users: The users can follow and unfollow other users on Instagram.
Like or dislike posts: The users can like or dislike posts of the accounts they follow.
Search photos and videos: The users can search photos and videos based on captions and location.
Generate news feed: The users can view the news feed consisting of the photos and videos (in chronological order) from all the users they follow.
2.2 Non-Functional requirements for Instagram System Design
Scalability: The system should be scalable to handle millions of users in terms of computational resources and storage.
Latency: The latency to generate a news feed should be low.
Availability: The system should be highly available.

10. Scalability for Instagram System Design
Scalability refers to the ability of an organization (or a system, such as a computer network) to perform well under an increased or expanding workload. A system that scales well will be able to maintain or increase its level of performance even as it is tested by larger and larger operational demands.

We can add more servers to application service layers to make the scalability better and handle numerous requests from the clients. We can also increase the number of databases to store the growing users’ data.

```
The function should return a dictionary where the keys are tuples of `(x,y)` pairs representing all possible combinations that meet these criteria: `x` is an odd number less than 10, `y` can be any integer from -5 to +5 (inclusive), and for each combination, we calculate `z = x**(n/p)`.
The values in the dictionary should correspond to lists containing all possible unique permutations of `x`, given that it is an odd number less than 10. However, there's a twist: if 'y' has any prime numbers between -5 and +5 (inclusive), those specific combinations with corresponding powers are not allowed.

To make the problem more interesting, we want to incorporate additional constraints on `p`. Let’s say that in addition to it being an odd number less than 10, if 'x' is also a square of any integer (such as x = 4 or x=9), then only those combinations where `(n*mod(p))==2` are allowed.

Lastly, we need the function not just to create this dictionary but print it in an organized manner. Here’s how: For each key-value pair (combination of `x`, and corresponding list), your program should first check whether 'y' is a prime number or satisfies certain conditions that result from our constraints on 'p'. If either case applies, the function must exclude those combinations entirely.

Finally, ensure all permutations are unique for each valid `(x, y)` combination. So if `z = x**(n/10)` gives two same results due to different n values but with permissible pairs of (x,y), keep only one instance in the final dictionary.

Your solution should demonstrate advanced understanding and mastery over conditional logic programming concepts like loops, conditionals for handling constraints on 'p' related issues along with permutation generation while avoiding duplicates. The resulting program must also be efficient enough to handle this combinatorial problem without exceedingly long execution times or memory use.

You can start by defining the function that takes `x`,`y`, and then implement these additional rules in your solution:
```python
def create_combinations(n, p):
    # Your code here to return a dictionary with required properties as per instructions above. 
# Function signature example provided.
print(create_combinations())  # This should print the final organized and unique combination results according to given constraints.

2.1 Functional Requirements for Instagram System Design
In functional Requirements, we will not discuss the login or signup page of Instagram. Login and Signup architecture is the same for everyone. We will look for further like posting photos, etc.

Is there any mention of selecting the right hardware or VM instance types?,"Notification Service:
Informs users about relevant events like likes, comments, mentions, and follows.
Pushes notifications to mobile devices through platforms like Firebase Cloud Messaging or Amazon SNS.
Leverages a queueing system for asynchronous notification delivery.
Analytics Service:
Tracks user engagement, post performance, and overall platform usage.
Gathers data on views, likes, comments, shares, and clicks.
Provides insights to improve user experience, optimize content recommendations, and target advertising.
Why we need caching for storing the data?
Cache the data to handle millions of reads. It improves the user experience by making the fetching process fast. We’ll also opt for lazy loading, which minimizes the client’s waiting time.
