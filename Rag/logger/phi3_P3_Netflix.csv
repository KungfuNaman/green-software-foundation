Is there any mention of minimizing the total number of deployed environments?,"Netflix uses Kafka and Apache Chukwe to ingest the data which is produced in a different part of the system. Netflix provides almost 500B data events that consume 1.3 PB/day and 8 million events that consume 24 GB/Second during peak time. These events include information like:

Error logs
UI activities
Performance events
Video viewing activities
Troubleshooting and diagnostic events.
Apache Chukwe is an open-source data collection system for collecting logs or events from a distributed system. It is built on top of HDFS and Map-reduce framework. It comes with Hadoop’s scalability and robustness features.

Hystrix library is designed to do this job. It helps you to control the interactions between these distributed services by adding latency tolerance and fault tolerance logic. Hystrix does this by isolating points of access between the services, remote system, and 3rd party libraries. The library helps to:

In a microservice architecture, services should be independent of each other. For example, The video storage service would be decoupled from the service responsible for transcoding videos.

Netflix divided the data into two parts:

Live Viewing History (LiveVH):
This section included the small number of recent viewing historical data of users with frequent updates. The data is frequently used for the ETL jobs and stored in uncompressed form.
Compressed Viewing History (CompressedVH):
A large amount of older viewing records with rare updates is categorized in this section. The data is stored in a single column per row key, also in compressed form to reduce the storage footprin",8.419980525970459," Response: No
Judgement explanation (less than 3 sentences): In my provided context about Netflix's system design and data handling, I did not find a specific reference to strategies aimed at reducing or optimising deployments across different computing platforms. The focus was more on the robustness of distributed systems through technologies like Apache Chukwe for event collection from various services within their architecture rather than minimizing deployed environments directly in this context snippet alone, hence my response is 'No'.",10.299790620803833,0,"[Document(page_content='Netflix uses Kafka and Apache Chukwe to ingest the data which is produced in a different part of the system.
