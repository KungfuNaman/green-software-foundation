has 180M+ subscribers in 200+ countries.

Image 2:  The image is a flowchart or diagram representing the architecture of Netflix's streaming service. It outlines the various components and processes involved in delivering video content to users. Here's a summary of the key components depicted:

---

1. Microservices System - This is likely the central hub where all microservices are integrated.
2. User Interface (UI) - Represents the user's interaction with the system.
3. DB - Likely refers to a database component of the system.
4. Microservice_system - A collection or series of microservices within the architecture.
5. DB - Another database component, possibly related to data storage and processing.
6. Microservices_system - Another set of microservices in the system.

different formats and resolutions.


Image 4:  The image displays a flowchart of a software architecture related to video streaming services. This appears to be a technical diagram explaining the various components and processes involved in encoding, decoding, and transporting video content over the internet. Here's a summary of the key components:

---

4. **REDIS CACHING**: This component is probably used for caching frequently accessed data to improve performance by reducing the number of times a database is hit to retrieve such data.

---

movies. Netflix personalizes this data and decides what kind of rows or what

kind of movies should be displayed to a specific user. This data is based on the

user’s historical data and preferences.

Also, for that specific user, Netflix performs sorting of the movies and calculates the

relevance ranking (for the recommendation) of these movies available on their

platform. In Netflix, Apache Spark is used for content recommendations and

personalization.

---

The key components in the diagram include:

---

5. **Output Codes**: After the video and audio have been successfully decoded at the receiver end, the output codes are sent to the server. These likely contain information on how the video was encoded and possibly metadata about the content for cataloging purposes.

---

6. Microservices_system - Another set of microservices in the system.
7. Microservices_system - Yet another group of microservices.
8. Microservice_DB - This could be a dedicated database for a specific microservice.
9. Microservice_DB - Another specialized database for a different microservice.
10. DB - A final, possibly central, database component in the architecture.

---

8. **HTTPS/TCP/IP**: These are the network protocols responsible for transporting the encrypted video content over the internet. HTTPS is used for secure communication between the client (the viewer) and the server, while TCP/IP ensure reliable data transmission.

-----

events from a distributed system. It is built on top of HDFS and Map-reduce

framework. It comes with Hadoop’s scalability and robustness features.

It includes a lot of powerful and flexible toolkits to display, monitor, and analyze

the result.

Chukwe collects the events from different parts of the system and from Chukwe

you can do monitoring and analysis or you can use the dashboard to view the

events.

---

25. **Machine Learning Engine**: This component likely uses machine learning algorithms to provide personalized content recommendations or other AI-driven services.

---

The architecture also includes arrows indicating data flow:
- From the EV COACHE APP, a request is sent to MONGODB DATABASE.
- The USER MANAGEMENT SERVICE interacts with both the database and the REDIS CACHING layer.
- The WRITTEN SERVICE receives a message from the USER MANAGEMENT SERVICE and sends it to an external system, labeled as ""SERVICE.""

---

1. At the top, there is a label ""Cassandra Service Pattern,"" which suggests that this pattern involves the use of the Cassandra database service.
2. Below the label, there is an icon representing the Cassandra database, accompanied by two rectangles labeled ""Rest Client."" These elements likely represent the architecture's components for interacting with the Cassandra database service.

---

Developers can also do load testing on newly deployed clusters in some machines.

They can route some existing traffic on these clusters and check how much load a

specific server can bear.

You can also test new services. When you upgrade the service and you want to

check how it behaves with the real-time API requests, in that case, you can deploy

the particular service on one server and you can redirect some part of the traffic to

the new service to check the service in real-time.

---

15. **Database Cluster**: This is a group of databases that work together to handle a large amount of data and ensure redundancy in case of server failure.
16. **Monitoring Services**: These services keep track of the performance and health of the system, providing insights into how it's functioning.
17. **Logging Services**: They collect and store logs that record events happening within the system, which is important for troubleshooting and auditing purposes.

---

6. **Content Delivery System (CDN)**: This system is responsible for delivering content from the server to the user's device efficiently.

7. **Video Streaming**: This is the core function of the platform, where video content is streamed to users in real-time.

8. **Analytics/Monitoring**: A component that collects and analyzes data on user behavior, system performance, etc., which can be used for improvements or analysis.",24.326938152313232," Judgement: Not applicable
