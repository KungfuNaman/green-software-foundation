,"Consistency: Messages should be delivered in the order they were sent.
Availability: The system should be highly available. However, the availability can be compromised in the interest of consistency.
Security: The system must be secure via end-to-end encryption. The end-to-end encryption ensures that only the two communicating parties can see the content of messages. Nobody in between, not even WhatsApp, should have access.
Scalability: The system should be highly scalable to support an ever-increasing number of users and messages per day.
Capacity Estimation
Storage Estimation:
100 billion messages are shared through WhatsApp per day and each message takes 100 bytes on average
100 billion/day∗100 Bytes = 10 TB/day
For 30 days, the storage capacity would become the following:
---
Bandwidth Estimation:
According to the storage capacity estimation, our service will get 10TB of data each day, giving us a bandwidth of 926 Mb/s.
10 TB/86400sec ≈ 926Mb/s

Number of servers estimation:
WhatsApp handles around 10 million connections on a single server, which seems quite high for a server.
No. of servers = Total connections per day/No. of connections per server = 2 billion/10 million = 200 servers

1. Connection with Websocket Server
In WhatsApp, each active device is connected with a WebSocket server via WebSocket protocol. A WebSocket server keeps the connection open with all the active (online) users. Since one server isn’t enough to handle billions of devices, there should be enough servers to handle billions of users.
---
The responsibility of each of these servers is to provide a port to every online user. The mapping between servers, ports, and users is stored in the WebSocket manager that resides on top of a cluster of the data store. In this case, that’s Redis.

2. Send or receive messages
The WebSocket manager is responsible for maintaining a mapping between an active user and a port assigned to the user. Whenever a user is connected to another WebSocket server, this information will be updated in the data store. A WebSocket server also communicates with another service called message service.
---
This API is used to send a text message from a sender to a receiver by making a POST API call to the /messages API endpoint. Generally, the sender’s and receiver’s IDs are their phone numbers.

Get Message
getMessage(user_Id)

Using this API call, users can fetch all unread messages when they come online after being offline for some time.

Upload File
uploadFile(file_type, file)

We can upload media files via the uploadFile API by making a POST request to the /v1/media API endpoint. A successful response returns an ID that’s forwarded to the receiver.

Download Media File
downloadFile(user_id, file_id)
---
The media file is compressed and encrypted on the device side.
The compressed and encrypted file is sent to the asset service to store the file on blob storage.
The asset service assigns an ID that’s communicated with the sender. The asset service also maintains a hash for each file to avoid duplication of content on the blob storage.
For example, if a user wants to upload an image that’s already there in the blob storage, the image won’t be uploaded. Instead, the same ID is forwarded to the receiver.
The asset service sends the ID of media files to the receiver via the message service. The receiver downloads the media file from the blob storage using the ID.
The content is loaded onto a CDN if the asset service receives a large number of requests for some particular content.
---
Functional Requirement
Conversation: The system should support one-on-one and group conversations between users.
Acknowledgment: The system should support message delivery acknowledgment, such as sent, delivered, and read.
Sharing: The system should support sharing of media files, such as images, videos, and audio.
Chat storage: The system must support the persistent storage of chat messages when a user is offline until the successful delivery of messages.
Push notifications: The system should be able to notify offline users of new messages once their status becomes online.
Non-Functional Requirement
Low latency: Users should be able to receive messages with low latency.
Consistency: Messages should be delivered in the order they were sent.

Message service is a repository of messages on top of the Mnesia database cluster. It acts as an interface to the Mnesia database for other services interacting with the databases. It is responsible for storing and retrieving messages from the Mnesia database. It also deletes messages from the Mnesia database after a configurable amount of time. And, it exposes APIs to receive messages by various filters, such as user ID, message ID, and so on.

3. Send or receive media files
We have another service called the asset service, which is responsible for sending and receiving media files.",2.097064971923828,"The provided architecture and design documents for a WhatsApp-like messaging system include several components and interfaces that work together to enable real-time communication between users. Here are some key points from the documents:

1. Microservices Architecture: The system is designed using a microservices architecture, which allows for horizontal scaling and decoupling of services. Each service has its own data model.
2. Connection with WebSocket Server: Each active device is connected to a WebSocket server via the WebSocket protocol. The WebSocket manager maintains a mapping between active users and ports assigned to them. When a user connects to another WebSocket server, this information is updated in the data store (Redis).
3. Send or Receive Messages: The WebSocket manager communicates with the message service API to send or receive messages. This API is used to send a text message from a sender to a receiver by making a POST API call to the /messages API endpoint. Users can also fetch all unread messages when they come online after being offline for some time using the GetMessage API.
4. Share Media Files: The asset service is responsible for sharing media files. It assigns an ID to the media file and communicates it to the receiver via the message service. The receiver downloads the media file from the blob storage using the ID.
5. Functional Requirements: The system should support one-on-one and group conversations between users, message delivery acknowledgment, sharing of media files, chat storage, push notifications, low latency, and consistency.
6. Non-Functional Requirements: The system should have low latency, and messages should be delivered in the order they were sent.
7. Message Service: The message service is a repository of messages on top of the Mnesia database cluster. It acts as an interface to the Mnesia database for other services interacting with the databases. It is responsible for storing and retrieving messages from the Mnesia database, deleting messages after a configurable amount of time, and exposing APIs to receive messages by various filters.
8. Asset Service: The asset service is responsible for sending and receiving media files. It compresses and encrypts media files on the device side before sending them to the blob storage. It assigns an ID to the media file and communicates it to the receiver via the message service.
9. Database: The system uses Mnesia as the database cluster, which provides a highly available and fault-tolerant database system.
10.

1. Connection with Websocket Server
In WhatsApp, each active device is connected with a WebSocket server via WebSocket protocol. A WebSocket server keeps the connection open with all the active (online) users. Since one server isn’t enough to handle billions of devices, there should be enough servers to handle billions of users.
---
The responsibility of each of these servers is to provide a port to every online user. The mapping between servers, ports, and users is stored in the WebSocket manager that resides on top of a cluster of the data store. In this case, that’s Redis.

2. Send or receive messages
The WebSocket manager is responsible for maintaining a mapping between an active user and a port assigned to the user. Whenever a user is connected to another WebSocket server, this information will be updated in the data store. A WebSocket server also communicates with another service called message service.

Scalability: The system should be highly scalable to support an ever-increasing number of users and messages per day.
Capacity Estimation
Storage Estimation:
100 billion messages are shared through WhatsApp per day and each message takes 100 bytes on average
100 billion/day∗100 Bytes = 10 TB/day
For 30 days, the storage capacity would become the following:
---
Bandwidth Estimation:
According to the storage capacity estimation, our service will get 10TB of data each day, giving us a bandwidth of 926 Mb/s.
10 TB/86400sec ≈ 926Mb/s

Number of servers estimation:
WhatsApp handles around 10 million connections on a single server, which seems quite high for a server.
No. of servers = Total connections per day/No. of connections per server = 2 billion/10 million = 200 servers
So, according to the above estimates, we require 200 chat servers.

Message service is a repository of messages on top of the Mnesia database cluster. It acts as an interface to the Mnesia database for other services interacting with the databases. It is responsible for storing and retrieving messages from the Mnesia database. It also deletes messages from the Mnesia database after a configurable amount of time. And, it exposes APIs to receive messages by various filters, such as user ID, message ID, and so on.

3. Send or receive media files
We have another service called the asset service, which is responsible for sending and receiving media files.
---
The media file is compressed and encrypted on the device side.
The compressed and encrypted file is sent to the asset service to store the file on blob storage.
The asset service assigns an ID that’s communicated with the sender. The asset service also maintains a hash for each file to avoid duplication of content on the blob storage.
For example, if a user wants to upload an image that’s already there in the blob storage, the image won’t be uploaded. Instead, the same ID is forwarded to the receiver.

The content is loaded onto a CDN if the asset service receives a large number of requests for some particular content.

This API is used to send a text message from a sender to a receiver by making a POST API call to the /messages API endpoint. Generally, the sender’s and receiver’s IDs are their phone numbers.

Here are some potential risks and challenges that you may want to consider when designing and implementing this system:

1. Scalability: With billions of users and a large number of messages being exchanged, the system must be able to handle the load and scale horizontally as needed. This may involve using distributed databases, load balancers, and other scalability tools.
2. Latency: As you mentioned, low latency is important for a messaging platform. You will need to design your system to minimize latency in message delivery, especially for group conversations where messages may be delivered to multiple recipients simultaneously.
3. Security: With the handling of sensitive data such as user credentials and message content, security must be a top priority. This may involve implementing encryption, access controls, and other security measures to protect user data.
4. Data consistency: With multiple servers and services involved in the messaging platform, ensuring data consistency across all of them can be challenging. You will need to design your system to maintain consistent data across all servers and services.
5. Availability: The messaging platform must be available at all times, even in the event of server failures or other issues. This may involve implementing redundancy and failover mechanisms to ensure that the platform remains available.
6. Message delivery guarantees: As you mentioned, messages should be delivered in the order they were sent. You will need to design your system to guarantee message delivery in a predictable manner.
7. Media file storage and retrieval: Storing and retrieving media files efficiently and reliably can be challenging, especially with large numbers of users and media files involved. You may want to consider using distributed storage systems or other specialized storage solutions.
8. User experience: With a complex system involving multiple services and data stores, it is important to ensure that the user experience remains smooth and intuitive. This may involve implementing user interfaces that are easy to use and understand, as well as providing clear documentation and support for users.
9. Integration with other services: Depending on how your messaging platform is implemented, you may need to integrate it with other services such as calendars, contacts, or social media platforms. This can add complexity to the system but can also provide valuable features and functionality for users.
10. Legal and regulatory compliance: Depending on the jurisdiction in which your messaging platform operates, there may be legal and regulatory requirements that must be met regarding data privacy, security, and other issues. You will need to ensure that your system is designed and implemented in compliance with these requirements.

By considering these potential risks and challenges, you can design and implement a messaging platform that is reliable, scalable, and secure, while also providing a good user experience and meeting legal and regulatory requirements.",17.753904342651367,0,"[(Document(page_content='Now, here comes the responsibility of the group service.

Capacity Estimation
Storage Estimation:
100 billion messages are shared through WhatsApp per day and each message takes 100 bytes on average
100 billion/day∗100 Bytes = 10 TB/day
For 30 days, the storage capacity would become the following:
---
Bandwidth Estimation:
According to the storage capacity estimation, our service will get 10TB of data each day, giving us a bandwidth of 926 Mb/s.
10 TB/86400sec ≈ 926Mb/s

Number of servers estimation:
WhatsApp handles around 10 million connections on a single server, which seems quite high for a server.
No. of servers = Total connections per day/No. of connections per server = 2 billion/10 million = 200 servers
So, according to the above estimates, we require 200 chat servers.

1. Connection with Websocket Server
In WhatsApp, each active device is connected with a WebSocket server via WebSocket protocol. A WebSocket server keeps the connection open with all the active (online) users. Since one server isn’t enough to handle billions of devices, there should be enough servers to handle billions of users.
---
The responsibility of each of these servers is to provide a port to every online user. The mapping between servers, ports, and users is stored in the WebSocket manager that resides on top of a cluster of the data store. In this case, that’s Redis.

2. Send or receive messages
The WebSocket manager is responsible for maintaining a mapping between an active user and a port assigned to the user. Whenever a user is connected to another WebSocket server, this information will be updated in the data store. A WebSocket server also communicates with another service called message service.
---
Functional Requirement
Conversation: The system should support one-on-one and group conversations between users.
Acknowledgment: The system should support message delivery acknowledgment, such as sent, delivered, and read.
Sharing: The system should support sharing of media files, such as images, videos, and audio.
Chat storage: The system must support the persistent storage of chat messages when a user is offline until the successful delivery of messages.
Push notifications: The system should be able to notify offline users of new messages once their status becomes online.
Non-Functional Requirement
Low latency: Users should be able to receive messages with low latency.
Consistency: Messages should be delivered in the order they were sent.

The media file is compressed and encrypted on the device side.
The compressed and encrypted file is sent to the asset service to store the file on blob storage.
The asset service assigns an ID that’s communicated with the sender. The asset service also maintains a hash for each file to avoid duplication of content on the blob storage.
For example, if a user wants to upload an image that’s already there in the blob storage, the image won’t be uploaded. Instead, the same ID is forwarded to the receiver.
The asset service sends the ID of media files to the receiver via the message service. The receiver downloads the media file from the blob storage using the ID.
The content is loaded onto a CDN if the asset service receives a large number of requests for some particular content.

2. WebSocket Server:
The design uses a WebSocket server to handle active users' connections. This is a good choice for real-time messaging systems, as WebSockets provide low-latency communication. However, it would be beneficial to have more detail on how the WebSocket server will handle scalability and availability (e.g., load balancing, redundancy, etc.).
3. Data Model Design:
The data model design seems straightforward and covers the basic entities required for a messaging system. However, it would be beneficial to have more detail on how the data model will handle relationships between entities (e.g., one-to-many, many-to-one, etc.).
4. Low-Level Design:
The low-level design provides a good overview of the system's architecture. However, it would be beneficial to have more detail on how the WebSocket manager will handle mapping between active users and ports, as well as how the message service will handle message delivery acknowledgment and storage.
5. Functional Requirements:
The functional requirements are quite comprehensive and cover various aspects of the system, such as conversation support, message delivery acknowledgment, sharing of media files, and push notifications. However, it would be beneficial to have more detail on how the system will handle failures or errors in these requirements (e.g., fallback strategies, exception handling, etc.).
6. Non-Functional Requirements:
The non-functional requirements are also comprehensive and cover aspects such as low latency, consistency, and scalability. However, it would be beneficial to have more detail on how the system will handle these requirements (e.g., caching, load balancing, etc.).
7. Media File Upload/Download:
The design provides a detailed overview of the media file upload/download process. However, it would be beneficial to have more detail on how the system will handle large files or multiple files being uploaded/downloaded simultaneously.
8. API Design:

Now, here comes the responsibility of the group service. The group service keeps all information about users in each group in the system. It has all the information about each group, including user IDs, group ID, status, group icon, number of users, and so on. This service resides on top of the MySQL database cluster, with multiple secondary replicas distributed geographically. A Redis cache server also exists to cache data from the MySQL servers. Both geographically distributed replicas and Redis cache aid in reducing latency.

The group message handler communicates with the group service to retrieve data of Group/A users. In the last step, the group message handler follows the same process as a WebSocket server and delivers the message to each user.

4. Support for Group messages
Since user A is connected to a WebSocket server, it sends a message to the message service intended for Group A.The message service sends the message to Kafka with other specific information about the group. The message is saved there for further processing. In Kafka terminology, a group can be a topic, and the senders and receivers can be producers and consumers, respectively.

User A and user B create a communication channel with the chat server.
User A sends a message to the chat server.
Upon receiving the message, the chat server acknowledges back to user A.
The chat server sends the message to user B and stores the message in the database if the receiver’s status is offline.
User B sends an acknowledgment to the chat server.
The chat server notifies user A that the message has been successfully delivered.
When user B reads the message, the application notifies the chat server.
The chat server notifies user A that user B has read the message.

1. Connection with Websocket Server
In WhatsApp, each active device is connected with a WebSocket server via WebSocket protocol. A WebSocket server keeps the connection open with all the active (online) users. Since one server isn’t enough to handle billions of devices, there should be enough servers to handle billions of users.
---
The responsibility of each of these servers is to provide a port to every online user. The mapping between servers, ports, and users is stored in the WebSocket manager that resides on top of a cluster of the data store. In this case, that’s Redis.

2. Send or receive messages
The WebSocket manager is responsible for maintaining a mapping between an active user and a port assigned to the user. Whenever a user is connected to another WebSocket server, this information will be updated in the data store. A WebSocket server also communicates with another service called message service.

Capacity Estimation
Storage Estimation:
100 billion messages are shared through WhatsApp per day and each message takes 100 bytes on average
100 billion/day∗100 Bytes = 10 TB/day
For 30 days, the storage capacity would become the following:
---
Bandwidth Estimation:
According to the storage capacity estimation, our service will get 10TB of data each day, giving us a bandwidth of 926 Mb/s.
10 TB/86400sec ≈ 926Mb/s

Number of servers estimation:
WhatsApp handles around 10 million connections on a single server, which seems quite high for a server.
No. of servers = Total connections per day/No. of connections per server = 2 billion/10 million = 200 servers
So, according to the above estimates, we require 200 chat servers.

The compressed and encrypted file is sent to the asset service to store the file on blob storage.
The asset service assigns an ID that’s communicated with the sender. The asset service also maintains a hash for each file to avoid duplication of content on the blob storage.
For example, if a user wants to upload an image that’s already there in the blob storage, the image won’t be uploaded. Instead, the same ID is forwarded to the receiver.
The asset service sends the ID of media files to the receiver via the message service. The receiver downloads the media file from the blob storage using the ID.

Message service is a repository of messages on top of the Mnesia database cluster. It acts as an interface to the Mnesia database for other services interacting with the databases. It is responsible for storing and retrieving messages from the Mnesia database. It also deletes messages from the Mnesia database after a configurable amount of time. And, it exposes APIs to receive messages by various filters, such as user ID, message ID, and so on.

5. Data Store: The data store is responsible for storing data related to users, groups, messages, and media files. It consists of multiple secondary replicas distributed geographically to reduce latency.
6. WebSocket Manager: This service manages the mapping between active users and their corresponding ports. It resides on top of a cluster of the data store and communicates with other services to update user status and handle messages delivery.
7. API Design: The system design includes an API for sending messages, which takes in message ID, sender ID, receiver ID, type (text, media, or document), and text or media object as inputs.
8. Data Model Design: The data model design involves compressing and encrypting media files on the device side before uploading them to the asset service. The asset service assigns a unique ID to each file and maintains a hash for each file to avoid duplication.

The responsibility of each of these servers is to provide a port to every online user. The mapping between servers, ports, and users is stored in the WebSocket manager that resides on top of a cluster of the data store. In this case, that’s Redis.

2. Send or receive messages
The WebSocket manager is responsible for maintaining a mapping between an active user and a port assigned to the user. Whenever a user is connected to another WebSocket server, this information will be updated in the data store. A WebSocket server also communicates with another service called message service.

1. Connection with Websocket Server
In WhatsApp, each active device is connected with a WebSocket server via WebSocket protocol. A WebSocket server keeps the connection open with all the active (online) users. Since one server isn’t enough to handle billions of devices, there should be enough servers to handle billions of users.
---
Functional Requirement
Conversation: The system should support one-on-one and group conversations between users.
Acknowledgment: The system should support message delivery acknowledgment, such as sent, delivered, and read.
Sharing: The system should support sharing of media files, such as images, videos, and audio.
Chat storage: The system must support the persistent storage of chat messages when a user is offline until the successful delivery of messages.
Push notifications: The system should be able to notify offline users of new messages once their status becomes online.
Non-Functional Requirement
Low latency: Users should be able to receive messages with low latency.
Consistency: Messages should be delivered in the order they were sent.

Message service is a repository of messages on top of the Mnesia database cluster. It acts as an interface to the Mnesia database for other services interacting with the databases. It is responsible for storing and retrieving messages from the Mnesia database. It also deletes messages from the Mnesia database after a configurable amount of time. And, it exposes APIs to receive messages by various filters, such as user ID, message ID, and so on.

3. Send or receive media files
We have another service called the asset service, which is responsible for sending and receiving media files.
---
This API is used to send a text message from a sender to a receiver by making a POST API call to the /messages API endpoint. Generally, the sender’s and receiver’s IDs are their phone numbers.

Get Message
getMessage(user_Id)

Using this API call, users can fetch all unread messages when they come online after being offline for some time.

Upload File
uploadFile(file_type, file)

We can upload media files via the uploadFile API by making a POST request to the /v1/media API endpoint. A successful response returns an ID that’s forwarded to the receiver.

Download Media File
downloadFile(user_id, file_id)
---
The media file is compressed and encrypted on the device side.
The compressed and encrypted file is sent to the asset service to store the file on blob storage.
The asset service assigns an ID that’s communicated with the sender. The asset service also maintains a hash for each file to avoid duplication of content on the blob storage.
For example, if a user wants to upload an image that’s already there in the blob storage, the image won’t be uploaded. Instead, the same ID is forwarded to the receiver.
The asset service sends the ID of media files to the receiver via the message service. The receiver downloads the media file from the blob storage using the ID.
The content is loaded onto a CDN if the asset service receives a large number of requests for some particular content.",2.1161937713623047,"1. What are the different types of servers in the WhatsApp messaging system?
Answer: The different types of servers in the WhatsApp messaging system are WebSocket servers, message service, asset service, and Redis cache server.
2. What is the role of each server?
Answer: The WebSocket server maintains a connection with all active users, while the message service is responsible for storing and retrieving messages from the Mnesia database. The asset service is responsible for sending and receiving media files, and the Redis cache server aids in reducing latency by caching data from the MySQL servers.
3. How do users communicate with each other?
Answer: Users communicate with each other through one-on-one or group conversations using the WebSocket protocol.
4. What is the purpose of the message service?
Answer: The message service acts as an interface to the Mnesia database for other services interacting with the databases, storing and retrieving messages from the Mnesia database, and deleting messages from the Mnesia database after a configurable amount of time.
5. How do users fetch all unread messages when they come online?
Answer: Users can fetch all unread messages by making an API call to the /messages API endpoint using the getMessage API.
6. How do users upload media files?
Answer: Users can upload media files via the uploadFile API by making a POST request to the /v1/media API endpoint. The compressed and encrypted file is then stored on blob storage, and an ID is assigned to the file which is communicated to the receiver.
7. How do users download media files?

Capacity Estimation
Storage Estimation:
100 billion messages are shared through WhatsApp per day and each message takes 100 bytes on average
100 billion/day∗100 Bytes = 10 TB/day
For 30 days, the storage capacity would become the following:
---
Bandwidth Estimation:
According to the storage capacity estimation, our service will get 10TB of data each day, giving us a bandwidth of 926 Mb/s.
10 TB/86400sec ≈ 926Mb/s

Number of servers estimation:
WhatsApp handles around 10 million connections on a single server, which seems quite high for a server.
No. of servers = Total connections per day/No. of connections per server = 2 billion/10 million = 200 servers
So, according to the above estimates, we require 200 chat servers.

The content is loaded onto a CDN if the asset service receives a large number of requests for some particular content.",2.0945956707000732,"Yes, the system you described uses a microservices architecture and horizontally scales by adding more servers to handle the increasing number of active users. This approach allows for easy decoupling of services and improves the system's ability to handle high traffic and large amounts of data. The use of a content delivery network (CDN) to load content onto the system is also a good practice, as it helps to distribute the load across multiple servers and improve the overall performance of the system.

However, there are some potential drawbacks to this design that you may want to consider:

1. Increased complexity: Microservices architecture can add complexity to the system, as each service may have its own database and may need to communicate with multiple other services. This can make it more difficult to manage and maintain the system.
2. Higher operational overhead: With more services to manage, there is a higher operational overhead in terms of monitoring, troubleshooting, and scaling the system.
3. Data consistency: With multiple services handling different aspects of the system, there may be concerns about data consistency across the different services. This can be mitigated by implementing proper data validation and conflict resolution mechanisms.
4. Security considerations: With more services exposed to the outside world, there is a higher security risk of attacks on the system. It is important to implement proper security measures such as authentication, authorization, and encryption.
5. Cost: Implementing a microservices architecture can be more expensive than a monolithic design, as it requires more hardware and software resources.

This service resides on top of the MySQL database cluster, with multiple secondary replicas distributed geographically. A Redis cache server also exists to cache data from the MySQL servers. Both geographically distributed replicas and Redis cache aid in reducing latency.

The group message handler communicates with the group service to retrieve data of Group/A users. In the last step, the group message handler follows the same process as a WebSocket server and delivers the message to each user.

4. Support for Group messages
Since user A is connected to a WebSocket server, it sends a message to the message service intended for Group A.The message service sends the message to Kafka with other specific information about the group. The message is saved there for further processing. In Kafka terminology, a group can be a topic, and the senders and receivers can be producers and consumers, respectively.

1. Connection with Websocket Server
In WhatsApp, each active device is connected with a WebSocket server via WebSocket protocol. A WebSocket server keeps the connection open with all the active (online) users. Since one server isn’t enough to handle billions of devices, there should be enough servers to handle billions of users.

The media file is compressed and encrypted on the device side.
The compressed and encrypted file is sent to the asset service to store the file on blob storage.
The asset service assigns an ID that’s communicated with the sender. The asset service also maintains a hash for each file to avoid duplication of content on the blob storage.
For example, if a user wants to upload an image that’s already there in the blob storage, the image won’t be uploaded. Instead, the same ID is forwarded to the receiver.
The asset service sends the ID of media files to the receiver via the message service. The receiver downloads the media file from the blob storage using the ID.
The content is loaded onto a CDN if the asset service receives a large number of requests for some particular content.

Message service is a repository of messages on top of the Mnesia database cluster. It acts as an interface to the Mnesia database for other services interacting with the databases. It is responsible for storing and retrieving messages from the Mnesia database. It also deletes messages from the Mnesia database after a configurable amount of time. And, it exposes APIs to receive messages by various filters, such as user ID, message ID, and so on.

Capacity Estimation
Storage Estimation:
100 billion messages are shared through WhatsApp per day and each message takes 100 bytes on average
100 billion/day∗100 Bytes = 10 TB/day
For 30 days, the storage capacity would become the following:
---
Bandwidth Estimation:
According to the storage capacity estimation, our service will get 10TB of data each day, giving us a bandwidth of 926 Mb/s.
10 TB/86400sec ≈ 926Mb/s

Number of servers estimation:
WhatsApp handles around 10 million connections on a single server, which seems quite high for a server.
No. of servers = Total connections per day/No. of connections per server = 2 billion/10 million = 200 servers
So, according to the above estimates, we require 200 chat servers.

To ensure low latency in the system, the design includes multiple secondary replicas of the MySQL database cluster distributed geographically. This helps in reducing latency by providing a closer location for users from different regions. Additionally, Redis cache is used to cache data from the MySQL servers, which further reduces latency.
2. Consistency:
To ensure that messages are delivered in the order they were sent, the system uses Kafka as a messaging system. Kafka is designed to handle high-throughput and provides guarantees for message ordering and delivery.

Capacity Estimation
Storage Estimation:
100 billion messages are shared through WhatsApp per day and each message takes 100 bytes on average
100 billion/day∗100 Bytes = 10 TB/day
For 30 days, the storage capacity would become the following:
---
Bandwidth Estimation:
According to the storage capacity estimation, our service will get 10TB of data each day, giving us a bandwidth of 926 Mb/s.
10 TB/86400sec ≈ 926Mb/s

Number of servers estimation:
WhatsApp handles around 10 million connections on a single server, which seems quite high for a server.
No. of servers = Total connections per day/No. of connections per server = 2 billion/10 million = 200 servers
So, according to the above estimates, we require 200 chat servers.

Now, here comes the responsibility of the group service. The group service keeps all information about users in each group in the system. It has all the information about each group, including user IDs, group ID, status, group icon, number of users, and so on. This service resides on top of the MySQL database cluster, with multiple secondary replicas distributed geographically. A Redis cache server also exists to cache data from the MySQL servers. Both geographically distributed replicas and Redis cache aid in reducing latency.

The group message handler communicates with the group service to retrieve data of Group/A users. In the last step, the group message handler follows the same process as a WebSocket server and delivers the message to each user.
---
4. Support for Group messages
Since user A is connected to a WebSocket server, it sends a message to the message service intended for Group A.The message service sends the message to Kafka with other specific information about the group. The message is saved there for further processing. In Kafka terminology, a group can be a topic, and the senders and receivers can be producers and consumers, respectively.

User A sends a message to the chat server.
Upon receiving the message, the chat server acknowledges back to user A.
The chat server sends the message to user B and stores the message in the database if the receiver’s status is offline.
User B sends an acknowledgment to the chat server.
The chat server notifies user A that the message has been successfully delivered.
When user B reads the message, the application notifies the chat server.
The chat server notifies user A that user B has read the message.

The responsibility of each of these servers is to provide a port to every online user. The mapping between servers, ports, and users is stored in the WebSocket manager that resides on top of a cluster of the data store. In this case, that’s Redis.

2. Send or receive messages
The WebSocket manager is responsible for maintaining a mapping between an active user and a port assigned to the user. Whenever a user is connected to another WebSocket server, this information will be updated in the data store. A WebSocket server also communicates with another service called message service.

1. Connection with Websocket Server
In WhatsApp, each active device is connected with a WebSocket server via WebSocket protocol. A WebSocket server keeps the connection open with all the active (online) users. Since one server isn’t enough to handle billions of devices, there should be enough servers to handle billions of users.

The media file is compressed and encrypted on the device side.
The compressed and encrypted file is sent to the asset service to store the file on blob storage.
The asset service assigns an ID that’s communicated with the sender. The asset service also maintains a hash for each file to avoid duplication of content on the blob storage.
For example, if a user wants to upload an image that’s already there in the blob storage, the image won’t be uploaded. Instead, the same ID is forwarded to the receiver.
The asset service sends the ID of media files to the receiver via the message service. The receiver downloads the media file from the blob storage using the ID.
The content is loaded onto a CDN if the asset service receives a large number of requests for some particular content.

This API is used to send a text message from a sender to a receiver by making a POST API call to the /messages API endpoint. Generally, the sender’s and receiver’s IDs are their phone numbers.

You have identified several servers and services that will be involved in the communication process, including WebSocket servers, message service, asset service, and CDN.

Here are some suggestions for improving the design:

1. Use a distributed database: Instead of relying on a single Redis instance, consider using a distributed database like Apache Cassandra or Amazon DynamoDB. This will provide better scalability and fault tolerance as the system grows.
2. Implement message queuing: To handle high traffic and prevent bottlenecks, consider implementing message queuing using a message broker like RabbitMQ or Apache Kafka. This will allow messages to be stored in a queue and processed when there are available resources.
3. Use load balancing: To distribute the workload across multiple servers, consider using load balancing techniques such as round-robin or least connections. This will ensure that no single server is overwhelmed with requests.
4. Implement message deduplication: To avoid sending duplicate messages to users who are already aware of them, consider implementing message deduplication at the message service level. This can be done using a variety of techniques, such as message IDs or timestamps.
5. Use content delivery networks (CDNs): To reduce latency and improve performance, consider using CDNs to cache media files and other assets. This will allow users to access the content more quickly and reduce the load on the backend servers.
6. Implement a message expiration policy: To prevent old messages from clogging up the system, consider implementing a message expiration policy that automatically deletes messages after a certain period of time.
7. Use user authentication and authorization: To ensure that only authorized users can access the messaging platform, consider implementing user authentication and authorization using OAuth or another security protocol. This will provide an additional layer of security and prevent unauthorized access to the system.
8. Monitoring and logging: Consider implementing monitoring and logging capabilities to track system performance and identify potential issues before they become critical. This can be done using tools like Prometheus, Grafana, or ELK Stack.
9. Implement message versioning: To handle version conflicts when multiple users are editing a message simultaneously, consider implementing message versioning. This will allow the system to keep track of multiple versions of a message and ensure that only the latest version is stored in the database.
10. Use a messaging protocol: To standardize the communication between clients and servers, consider using a messaging protocol like WebSocket or MQTT.

Availability: The system should be highly available. However, the availability can be compromised in the interest of consistency.
Security: The system must be secure via end-to-end encryption. The end-to-end encryption ensures that only the two communicating parties can see the content of messages. Nobody in between, not even WhatsApp, should have access.
Scalability: The system should be highly scalable to support an ever-increasing number of users and messages per day.
Capacity Estimation
Storage Estimation:
100 billion messages are shared through WhatsApp per day and each message takes 100 bytes on average
100 billion/day∗100 Bytes = 10 TB/day
For 30 days, the storage capacity would become the following:
---
Bandwidth Estimation:
According to the storage capacity estimation, our service will get 10TB of data each day, giving us a bandwidth of 926 Mb/s.
10 TB/86400sec ≈ 926Mb/s

Number of servers estimation:
WhatsApp handles around 10 million connections on a single server, which seems quite high for a server.
No. of servers = Total connections per day/No. of connections per server = 2 billion/10 million = 200 servers
So, according to the above estimates, we require 200 chat servers.

Now, here comes the responsibility of the group service. The group service keeps all information about users in each group in the system. It has all the information about each group, including user IDs, group ID, status, group icon, number of users, and so on. This service resides on top of the MySQL database cluster, with multiple secondary replicas distributed geographically. A Redis cache server also exists to cache data from the MySQL servers. Both geographically distributed replicas and Redis cache aid in reducing latency.

The group message handler communicates with the group service to retrieve data of Group/A users. In the last step, the group message handler follows the same process as a WebSocket server and delivers the message to each user.
---
4. Support for Group messages
Since user A is connected to a WebSocket server, it sends a message to the message service intended for Group A.The message service sends the message to Kafka with other specific information about the group. The message is saved there for further processing. In Kafka terminology, a group can be a topic, and the senders and receivers can be producers and consumers, respectively.

The following steps describe the communication between both clients:

User A and user B create a communication channel with the chat server.
User A sends a message to the chat server.
Upon receiving the message, the chat server acknowledges back to user A.
The chat server sends the message to user B and stores the message in the database if the receiver’s status is offline.
User B sends an acknowledgment to the chat server.
The chat server notifies user A that the message has been successfully delivered.
When user B reads the message, the application notifies the chat server.
The chat server notifies user A that user B has read the message.

The responsibility of each of these servers is to provide a port to every online user. The mapping between servers, ports, and users is stored in the WebSocket manager that resides on top of a cluster of the data store. In this case, that’s Redis.

2. Send or receive messages
The WebSocket manager is responsible for maintaining a mapping between an active user and a port assigned to the user. Whenever a user is connected to another WebSocket server, this information will be updated in the data store. A WebSocket server also communicates with another service called message service.

The media file is compressed and encrypted on the device side.
The compressed and encrypted file is sent to the asset service to store the file on blob storage.
The asset service assigns an ID that’s communicated with the sender. The asset service also maintains a hash for each file to avoid duplication of content on the blob storage.
For example, if a user wants to upload an image that’s already there in the blob storage, the image won’t be uploaded. Instead, the same ID is forwarded to the receiver.
The asset service sends the ID of media files to the receiver via the message service. The receiver downloads the media file from the blob storage using the ID.
The content is loaded onto a CDN if the asset service receives a large number of requests for some particular content.

Designing Whatsapp Messenger | System Design
Last Updated : 18 Mar, 2024
Ever thought about how this widely-used messaging app actually works behind the scenes? This article is your guide to the system design of WhatsApp. From handling tons of messages to making sure your chats are secure, we’ll explore the technical aspects that keep this app running smoothly and managing things like managing data, keeping your messages private, and the challenges of making sure your texts arrive lightning-fast.

Designing-WhatsApp-Messenger--System-Design

Important Topics for WhatsApp System Design",2.2557437419891357,"1. Connection with Websocket Server: In WhatsApp, each active device is connected to a WebSocket server via the WebSocket protocol. A WebSocket server keeps the connection open with all active (online) users. Since one server isn't enough to handle billions of devices, there should be enough servers to handle billions of users.
2. Media File Handling: When a user wants to upload an image or video, it is compressed and encrypted on their device side. The compressed and encrypted file is sent to the asset service to store the file in blob storage. The asset service assigns an ID that's communicated with the sender. The asset service also maintains a hash for each file to avoid duplication of content on the blob storage.
3. Message Handling: When user A sends a message to group A, the message service sends the message to Kafka with other specific information about the group. The message is saved there for further processing. In Kafka terminology, a group can be a topic, and the senders and receivers can be producers and consumers, respectively.
4. Data Model Design: The responsibility of each of these servers is to provide a port to every online user. The mapping between servers, ports, and users is stored in the WebSocket manager that resides on top of a cluster of the data store. In this case, that's Redis.
5. API Design: The following APIs are used in WhatsApp messaging:
* Send Message: sendMessage(message_ID, sender_ID, receiver_ID, type, text=none, media_object=none, document=none)
* Get Message: getMessage(user_Id)
* Upload File: uploadFile(file_type, file)
* Download Media File: downloadFile(user_id, file_id)
6. Security: WhatsApp ensures that messages are delivered in the order they were sent by using a queue to handle messages asynchronously. The system also employs end-to-end encryption to keep your chats private and secure.
7. Scalability: To handle billions of users, the system uses microservices architecture, which makes it easier to horizontally scale and decouple services. Each service has ownership of its own data model.
8. Load Balancing: The system uses load balancing to distribute incoming traffic across multiple servers, ensuring that no single server is overwhelmed with requests.
9. Asset Service: The asset service assigns an ID that's communicated with the sender and maintains a hash for each file to avoid duplication of content on blob storage.
10.

,"Consistency: Messages should be delivered in the order they were sent.
Availability: The system should be highly available. However, the availability can be compromised in the interest of consistency.

Scalability: The system should be highly scalable to support an ever-increasing number of users and messages per day.
Capacity Estimation
Storage Estimation:
100 billion messages are shared through WhatsApp per day and each message takes 100 bytes on average
100 billion/day∗100 Bytes = 10 TB/day
For 30 days, the storage capacity would become the following:
---
Bandwidth Estimation:
According to the storage capacity estimation, our service will get 10TB of data each day, giving us a bandwidth of 926 Mb/s.
10 TB/86400sec ≈ 926Mb/s

Number of servers estimation:
WhatsApp handles around 10 million connections on a single server, which seems quite high for a server.
No. of servers = Total connections per day/No. of connections per server = 2 billion/10 million = 200 servers

Conversation: The system should support one-on-one and group conversations between users.
Acknowledgment: The system should support message delivery acknowledgment, such as sent, delivered, and read.
Sharing: The system should support sharing of media files, such as images, videos, and audio.

Push notifications: The system should be able to notify offline users of new messages once their status becomes online.
Non-Functional Requirement
Low latency: Users should be able to receive messages with low latency.
Consistency: Messages should be delivered in the order they were sent.
---
Now, here comes the responsibility of the group service. The group service keeps all information about users in each group in the system. It has all the information about each group, including user IDs, group ID, status, group icon, number of users, and so on. This service resides on top of the MySQL database cluster, with multiple secondary replicas distributed geographically. A Redis cache server also exists to cache data from the MySQL servers. Both geographically distributed replicas and Redis cache aid in reducing latency.

The group message handler communicates with the group service to retrieve data of Group/A users. In the last step, the group message handler follows the same process as a WebSocket server and delivers the message to each user.

4. Support for Group messages
Since user A is connected to a WebSocket server, it sends a message to the message service intended for Group A.The message service sends the message to Kafka with other specific information about the group. The message is saved there for further processing. In Kafka terminology, a group can be a topic, and the senders and receivers can be producers and consumers, respectively.

User B sends an acknowledgment to the chat server.
The chat server notifies user A that the message has been successfully delivered.
When user B reads the message, the application notifies the chat server.
The chat server notifies user A that user B has read the message.

The responsibility of each of these servers is to provide a port to every online user. The mapping between servers, ports, and users is stored in the WebSocket manager that resides on top of a cluster of the data store. In this case, that’s Redis.

2. Send or receive messages
The WebSocket manager is responsible for maintaining a mapping between an active user and a port assigned to the user. Whenever a user is connected to another WebSocket server, this information will be updated in the data store. A WebSocket server also communicates with another service called message service.

For 30 days, the storage capacity would become the following:
30∗10 TB/day = 300 TB/month
---
This API is used to send a text message from a sender to a receiver by making a POST API call to the /messages API endpoint. Generally, the sender’s and receiver’s IDs are their phone numbers.

Get Message
getMessage(user_Id)

Using this API call, users can fetch all unread messages when they come online after being offline for some time.

Upload File
uploadFile(file_type, file)

We can upload media files via the uploadFile API by making a POST request to the /v1/media API endpoint. A successful response returns an ID that’s forwarded to the receiver.

Download Media File
downloadFile(user_id, file_id)

Low Level Design (LLD) of System Design
Low-Level-Design(LLD)-of-WhatsApp-Messenger

1. Connection with Websocket Server
In WhatsApp, each active device is connected with a WebSocket server via WebSocket protocol. A WebSocket server keeps the connection open with all the active (online) users. Since one server isn’t enough to handle billions of devices, there should be enough servers to handle billions of users.
---
The media file is compressed and encrypted on the device side.
The compressed and encrypted file is sent to the asset service to store the file on blob storage.
The asset service assigns an ID that’s communicated with the sender. The asset service also maintains a hash for each file to avoid duplication of content on the blob storage.
For example, if a user wants to upload an image that’s already there in the blob storage, the image won’t be uploaded. Instead, the same ID is forwarded to the receiver.
The asset service sends the ID of media files to the receiver via the message service. The receiver downloads the media file from the blob storage using the ID.
The content is loaded onto a CDN if the asset service receives a large number of requests for some particular content.",2.14534330368042,"1. What are the non-functional requirements for the messaging system?

Low latency and consistency in message delivery are non-functional requirements for the messaging system. Low latency means that messages should be delivered quickly after they are sent, while consistency means that messages should be delivered in the order they were sent.

2. How does the group message handler communicate with the group service?

The group message handler communicates with the group service to retrieve data about Group/A users. It follows the same process as a WebSocket server and delivers the message to each user.

3. What is Kafka, and how does it relate to the messaging system?

Kafka is a distributed streaming platform that can handle high-volume data processing and event-driven architectures. In the messaging system, Kafka can be used as a topic where messages are saved for further processing. Senders and receivers can be producers and consumers, respectively.

4. What is the responsibility of each server in the system?

Each server in the system has the following responsibilities:

* WebSocket manager: Provides a port to every online user and maintains a mapping between active users and assigned ports.
* Data store (e.g., Redis): Stores data about active users, including their statuses.
* Message service: Communicates with the group service to retrieve data of Group/A users and delivers messages to each user.
* Asset service: Stores media files on blob storage and assigns an ID to each file.
5. How do users receive messages once their status becomes online?

Once a user's status becomes online, the message service communicates with the group service to retrieve data of Group/A users, and delivers the message to each user.

6. What is the storage capacity of the system over 30 days?

Over 30 days, the storage capacity of the system would be approximately 300 TB/month, assuming an average of 10 TB/day.

7. How do users upload media files to the system?

Users can upload media files via the uploadFile API by making a POST request to the /v1/media API endpoint. The asset service then stores the file on blob storage and assigns an ID to it. The ID is communicated with the sender.

8. How does the system handle duplication of content on the blob storage?

The asset service maintains a hash for each file to avoid duplication of content on the blob storage. If a user tries to upload an image that's already there in the blob storage, the image won't be uploaded, and the same ID is forwarded to the receiver instead.",16.557868719100952,0,"[(Document(page_content='Now, here comes the responsibility of the group service.

For 30 days, the storage capacity would become the following:
30∗10 TB/day = 300 TB/month",2.2811765670776367,"The given system design is for a messaging platform that supports group messages. The system consists of several microservices, including a WebSocket server, a message service, a group message handler, and an asset service. Each microservice has its own data model, and the system uses a distributed database cluster with Redis cache to store and retrieve data.

Here are some key design decisions and considerations:

1. Use of Microservices: The system uses a microservices architecture, which allows for easier scaling and decoupling of services. This is important for a messaging platform that needs to handle a large number of users and messages.
2. WebSocket Connection: Each active device is connected to a WebSocket server via the WebSocket protocol. This allows for real-time communication between devices and the system.
3. Data Storage: The system uses a distributed database cluster with Redis cache to store and retrieve data. This provides fast access to data and reduces latency.
4. Group Messages: The group message handler communicates with the group service to retrieve data of Group/A users. In Kafka terminology, a group can be a topic, and the senders and receivers can be producers and consumers, respectively.
5. Media File Upload and Download: Media files are compressed and encrypted on the device side before being sent to the asset service for storage on blob storage. The asset service assigns an ID to each file and communicates it to the receiver via the message service. Users can download media files from the blob storage using the ID.
6. Content Loading: If the asset service receives a large number of requests for some particular content, the content is loaded onto a CDN to reduce latency.
7. Data Model Design: Each microservice has its own data model, which are designed to handle the specific requirements of that service.
8. Low Latency: The system is designed to provide low latency communication between devices and the system. This is achieved through the use of a distributed database cluster and Redis cache.
9. Consistency: Messages are delivered in the order they were sent, ensuring consistency in message delivery.
10. Scalability: The system is designed to handle a large number of users and messages, making it highly scalable.

Some potential challenges and considerations for this design include:

1. Scalability: As the number of users and messages grows, the system may need to be scaled to handle the increased load. This could involve adding more servers or upgrading existing hardware.
2. Latency: The system may experience latency issues if the database cluster or Redis cache is not properly configured or if there are too many requests for data at once.
3. Data consistency: Ensuring that data is consistent across all services and databases can be challenging, especially in a distributed environment.
4. Security: Ensuring the security of sensitive data, such as user credentials and message content, is crucial. This may involve implementing encryption and authentication protocols.
5. Availability: The system must be available at all times to ensure that users can communicate with each other effectively.

The responsibility of each of these servers is to provide a port to every online user. The mapping between servers, ports, and users is stored in the WebSocket manager that resides on top of a cluster of the data store. In this case, that’s Redis.

2. Send or receive messages
The WebSocket manager is responsible for maintaining a mapping between an active user and a port assigned to the user. Whenever a user is connected to another WebSocket server, this information will be updated in the data store. A WebSocket server also communicates with another service called message service.
---
Functional Requirement
Conversation: The system should support one-on-one and group conversations between users.
Acknowledgment: The system should support message delivery acknowledgment, such as sent, delivered, and read.
Sharing: The system should support sharing of media files, such as images, videos, and audio.
Chat storage: The system must support the persistent storage of chat messages when a user is offline until the successful delivery of messages.
Push notifications: The system should be able to notify offline users of new messages once their status becomes online.
Non-Functional Requirement
Low latency: Users should be able to receive messages with low latency.
Consistency: Messages should be delivered in the order they were sent.

1. Connection with Websocket Server
In WhatsApp, each active device is connected with a WebSocket server via WebSocket protocol. A WebSocket server keeps the connection open with all the active (online) users. Since one server isn’t enough to handle billions of devices, there should be enough servers to handle billions of users.

Message service is a repository of messages on top of the Mnesia database cluster. It acts as an interface to the Mnesia database for other services interacting with the databases. It is responsible for storing and retrieving messages from the Mnesia database. It also deletes messages from the Mnesia database after a configurable amount of time. And, it exposes APIs to receive messages by various filters, such as user ID, message ID, and so on.

3. Send or receive media files
We have another service called the asset service, which is responsible for sending and receiving media files.
---
This API is used to send a text message from a sender to a receiver by making a POST API call to the /messages API endpoint. Generally, the sender’s and receiver’s IDs are their phone numbers.

Get Message
getMessage(user_Id)

Using this API call, users can fetch all unread messages when they come online after being offline for some time.

Upload File
uploadFile(file_type, file)

We can upload media files via the uploadFile API by making a POST request to the /v1/media API endpoint. A successful response returns an ID that’s forwarded to the receiver.

Capacity Estimation
Storage Estimation:
100 billion messages are shared through WhatsApp per day and each message takes 100 bytes on average
100 billion/day∗100 Bytes = 10 TB/day
For 30 days, the storage capacity would become the following:
---
Bandwidth Estimation:
According to the storage capacity estimation, our service will get 10TB of data each day, giving us a bandwidth of 926 Mb/s.
10 TB/86400sec ≈ 926Mb/s

Number of servers estimation:
WhatsApp handles around 10 million connections on a single server, which seems quite high for a server.
No. of servers = Total connections per day/No. of connections per server = 2 billion/10 million = 200 servers

The responsibility of each of these servers is to provide a port to every online user. The mapping between servers, ports, and users is stored in the WebSocket manager that resides on top of a cluster of the data store. In this case, that’s Redis.

2. Send or receive messages
The WebSocket manager is responsible for maintaining a mapping between an active user and a port assigned to the user. Whenever a user is connected to another WebSocket server, this information will be updated in the data store. A WebSocket server also communicates with another service called message service.
---
This API is used to send a text message from a sender to a receiver by making a POST API call to the /messages API endpoint. Generally, the sender’s and receiver’s IDs are their phone numbers.

Get Message
getMessage(user_Id)

Using this API call, users can fetch all unread messages when they come online after being offline for some time.

Upload File
uploadFile(file_type, file)

We can upload media files via the uploadFile API by making a POST request to the /v1/media API endpoint. A successful response returns an ID that’s forwarded to the receiver.

Download Media File
downloadFile(user_id, file_id)

Architecture
We will be using microservices architecture since it will make it easier to horizontally scale and decouple our services. Each service will have ownership of its own data model.

1. Connection with Websocket Server
In WhatsApp, each active device is connected with a WebSocket server via WebSocket protocol. A WebSocket server keeps the connection open with all the active (online) users. Since one server isn’t enough to handle billions of devices, there should be enough servers to handle billions of users.
---
The media file is compressed and encrypted on the device side.
The compressed and encrypted file is sent to the asset service to store the file on blob storage.
The asset service assigns an ID that’s communicated with the sender. The asset service also maintains a hash for each file to avoid duplication of content on the blob storage.
For example, if a user wants to upload an image that’s already there in the blob storage, the image won’t be uploaded. Instead, the same ID is forwarded to the receiver.
The asset service sends the ID of media files to the receiver via the message service. The receiver downloads the media file from the blob storage using the ID.
The content is loaded onto a CDN if the asset service receives a large number of requests for some particular content.

Message service is a repository of messages on top of the Mnesia database cluster. It acts as an interface to the Mnesia database for other services interacting with the databases. It is responsible for storing and retrieving messages from the Mnesia database. It also deletes messages from the Mnesia database after a configurable amount of time. And, it exposes APIs to receive messages by various filters, such as user ID, message ID, and so on.

3. Send or receive media files
We have another service called the asset service, which is responsible for sending and receiving media files.",2.1235992908477783,"based on the provided information, here is a possible architecture for the WhatsApp messaging system:

1. WebSocket Server:
	* Acts as the connection hub for all active users in the system.
	* Handles communication between clients and the message service.
	* Maintains a mapping of active users to their corresponding ports.
2. Message Service:
	* Responsible for storing and retrieving messages from the Mnesia database cluster.
	* Exposes APIs for receiving messages based on user ID, message ID, and other filters.
	* Deletes messages from the Mnesia database after a configurable amount of time.
3. Asset Service:
	* Handles media file uploads and downloads.
	* Compresses and encrypts media files on the device side.
	* Stores media files in blob storage with a unique ID.
	* Sends the ID of media files to the receiver via the message service.
4. Mnesia Database Cluster:
	* Stores messages and media files for retrieval by the message service.
5. Redis Cache Server:
	* Caches data from the MySQL database cluster to reduce latency.
6. MySQL Database Cluster:
	* Stores user information, group details, and other metadata for the WhatsApp messaging system.
7. Kafka:
	* Acts as a message broker for group messages.
	* Receives messages from the message service and stores them in a topic.
	* Handles message delivery to users in the group.

Low-Level Design (LLD) of System Design:

1. Connection with Websocket Server:
	* Each active user establishes a connection with the WebSocket server via the WebSocket protocol.
	* The WebSocket server maintains a mapping of active users to their corresponding ports.
2. Messaging Process:
	* When a user sends a message, it is stored in the Mnesia database by the message service.
	* The message service sends the message to the Kafka topic for delivery to the intended recipients.
	* Each recipient retrieves the message from the Kafka topic and stores it in their local cache.
3. Media File Upload/Download:
	* When a user uploads a media file, it is compressed and encrypted on the device side.
	* The asset service stores the media file in blob storage with a unique ID.
	* The asset service sends the ID of the media file to the receiver via the message service.
4. Message Filtering:
	* The message service filters messages based on user ID, message ID, and other filters.
	* Messages that pass the filtering criteria are stored in the Mnesia database for delivery to the intended recipients.
5. Message Delivery:
	* When a recipient connects to the WebSocket server, they retrieve their unread messages from the Mnesia database.
	* The message service delivers the messages to the recipient’s WebSocket client for display.
6. Media File Playback:
	* When a user wants to play back media files, the asset service loads the file onto a Content Delivery Network (CDN) if necessary.
	* The CDN handles the distribution of the media file to users.

Scalability: The system should be highly scalable to support an ever-increasing number of users and messages per day.
Capacity Estimation
Storage Estimation:
100 billion messages are shared through WhatsApp per day and each message takes 100 bytes on average
100 billion/day∗100 Bytes = 10 TB/day
For 30 days, the storage capacity would become the following:
---
Bandwidth Estimation:
According to the storage capacity estimation, our service will get 10TB of data each day, giving us a bandwidth of 926 Mb/s.
10 TB/86400sec ≈ 926Mb/s

Number of servers estimation:
WhatsApp handles around 10 million connections on a single server, which seems quite high for a server.
No. of servers = Total connections per day/No. of connections per server = 2 billion/10 million = 200 servers
So, according to the above estimates, we require 200 chat servers.

Here are some possible design patterns and architectures that could be used to implement this system:

1. Microservices Architecture:
As you mentioned, a microservices architecture would make it easier to horizontally scale and decouple the services. Each service could have ownership of its own data model, and communicate with other services via APIs.
2. Load Balancer:
To handle a large number of active users, a load balancer could be used to distribute incoming connections across multiple WebSocket servers. This would ensure that no single server is overwhelmed with connections.
3. Message Queue:
To handle the delivery of messages, a message queue could be used to store and deliver messages in order. When a user sends a message, it could be added to the message queue, and when the recipient connects, the messages could be retrieved from the queue and delivered to them.
4. Asset Service:
To handle media file uploads and downloading, an asset service could be used to store the files on blob storage. The asset service could assign a unique ID to each file, and communicate this ID to the sender and recipient. When the recipient downloads the file, they could use the ID to retrieve the file from the asset service.
5. Content Delivery Network (CDN):
To improve performance, a CDN could be used to load media files onto a network of servers around the world. This would reduce the latency for users accessing the media files from different locations.
6. Database:
A database could be used to store user information, such as phone numbers and message history. The database could also be used to handle offline messages, by storing messages when a user is offline and delivering them once they come online again.
7. WebSocket Protocol:
To handle real-time communication between users, the WebSocket protocol could be used to establish a persistent connection between the client and server. This would allow for low latency communication and message delivery acknowledgment.
8. Push Notifications:
To notify offline users of new messages, push notifications could be used to deliver the messages as soon as they become available. The push notifications could be handled by a third-party service or integrated with the messaging platform directly.
9. Security:
To ensure security, encryption could be used to protect the messages and media files during transmission. Additionally, authentication and authorization could be implemented to ensure that only authorized users can access the system.
10. Scalability:
To handle a large number of users, the system should be designed for scalability. This could involve using load balancers, horizontal scaling, and sharding to distribute the workload across multiple servers.

Overall, the design pattern and architecture used will depend on the specific requirements of the messaging platform and the traffic it is expected to handle.",17.87659764289856,0,"[(Document(page_content='Now, here comes the responsibility of the group service.

10 TB/86400sec ≈ 926Mb/s

Number of servers estimation:
WhatsApp handles around 10 million connections on a single server, which seems quite high for a server.
No. of servers = Total connections per day/No. of connections per server = 2 billion/10 million = 200 servers
So, according to the above estimates, we require 200 chat servers.

Now, here comes the responsibility of the group service. The group service keeps all information about users in each group in the system. It has all the information about each group, including user IDs, group ID, status, group icon, number of users, and so on. This service resides on top of the MySQL database cluster, with multiple secondary replicas distributed geographically. A Redis cache server also exists to cache data from the MySQL servers. Both geographically distributed replicas and Redis cache aid in reducing latency.

The group message handler communicates with the group service to retrieve data of Group/A users. In the last step, the group message handler follows the same process as a WebSocket server and delivers the message to each user.
---
4. Support for Group messages
Since user A is connected to a WebSocket server, it sends a message to the message service intended for Group A.The message service sends the message to Kafka with other specific information about the group. The message is saved there for further processing. In Kafka terminology, a group can be a topic, and the senders and receivers can be producers and consumers, respectively.

The following steps describe the communication between both clients:

User A and user B create a communication channel with the chat server.
User A sends a message to the chat server.
Upon receiving the message, the chat server acknowledges back to user A.
The chat server sends the message to user B and stores the message in the database if the receiver’s status is offline.
User B sends an acknowledgment to the chat server.
The chat server notifies user A that the message has been successfully delivered.
When user B reads the message, the application notifies the chat server.
The chat server notifies user A that user B has read the message.

The responsibility of each of these servers is to provide a port to every online user. The mapping between servers, ports, and users is stored in the WebSocket manager that resides on top of a cluster of the data store. In this case, that’s Redis.

2. Send or receive messages
The WebSocket manager is responsible for maintaining a mapping between an active user and a port assigned to the user. Whenever a user is connected to another WebSocket server, this information will be updated in the data store. A WebSocket server also communicates with another service called message service.

1. Connection with Websocket Server
In WhatsApp, each active device is connected with a WebSocket server via WebSocket protocol. A WebSocket server keeps the connection open with all the active (online) users. Since one server isn’t enough to handle billions of devices, there should be enough servers to handle billions of users.
---
Functional Requirement
Conversation: The system should support one-on-one and group conversations between users.
Acknowledgment: The system should support message delivery acknowledgment, such as sent, delivered, and read.
Sharing: The system should support sharing of media files, such as images, videos, and audio.
Chat storage: The system must support the persistent storage of chat messages when a user is offline until the successful delivery of messages.
Push notifications: The system should be able to notify offline users of new messages once their status becomes online.
Non-Functional Requirement
Low latency: Users should be able to receive messages with low latency.
Consistency: Messages should be delivered in the order they were sent.
---
The media file is compressed and encrypted on the device side.
The compressed and encrypted file is sent to the asset service to store the file on blob storage.
The asset service assigns an ID that’s communicated with the sender. The asset service also maintains a hash for each file to avoid duplication of content on the blob storage.
For example, if a user wants to upload an image that’s already there in the blob storage, the image won’t be uploaded. Instead, the same ID is forwarded to the receiver.
The asset service sends the ID of media files to the receiver via the message service. The receiver downloads the media file from the blob storage using the ID.
The content is loaded onto a CDN if the asset service receives a large number of requests for some particular content.
---
This API is used to send a text message from a sender to a receiver by making a POST API call to the /messages API endpoint. Generally, the sender’s and receiver’s IDs are their phone numbers.

Get Message
getMessage(user_Id)

Using this API call, users can fetch all unread messages when they come online after being offline for some time.

Upload File
uploadFile(file_type, file)

We can upload media files via the uploadFile API by making a POST request to the /v1/media API endpoint. A successful response returns an ID that’s forwarded to the receiver.

downloadFile(user_id, file_id)",2.1290979385375977,"The system design you provided is for a messaging platform with features such as one-on-one and group conversations, sharing of media files, and push notifications. Here are some observations and questions based on the information provided:

 Observations:

1. The system seems to be designed for a large number of users, with multiple WebSocket servers handling connections from active users. This suggests that the system is designed to scale horizontally.
2. The system uses a microservices architecture, with each service responsible for its own data model. This allows for greater flexibility and scalability in the system.
3. The system appears to use Redis as a cache server to reduce latency. This is a common pattern in modern web applications, as Redis can provide fast caching and message handling capabilities.
4. The system uses Kafka as a message broker for sending messages between services. Kafka is a popular choice for message brokering due to its ability to handle high volumes of messages and its scalability.
5. The system seems to have a clear separation of concerns, with each service handling a specific aspect of the messaging platform (e.g., WebSocket server handles connections, message service handles message routing).

 Questions:

1. How does the system handle message delivery failures? For example, if a user's connection is lost during message transmission, how will the message be retried or resent?
2. How does the system manage the storage of chat messages when a user goes offline? It seems that the system stores the messages in Redis, but how does it ensure that the messages are not lost when the user comes back online?
3. Can you provide more details on how the system handles push notifications for offline users? For example, how does the system determine which messages to notify the user about and how does it handle multiple messages arriving at the same time?
4. How does the system ensure data consistency across multiple WebSocket servers and Kafka brokers? For example, if a message is sent from one server but not received by another due to network issues, how does the system handle this inconsistency?
5. Can you provide more details on the data model used by each service in the system?

,"Consistency: Messages should be delivered in the order they were sent.
Availability: The system should be highly available. However, the availability can be compromised in the interest of consistency.
Security: The system must be secure via end-to-end encryption. The end-to-end encryption ensures that only the two communicating parties can see the content of messages. Nobody in between, not even WhatsApp, should have access.
Scalability: The system should be highly scalable to support an ever-increasing number of users and messages per day.
Capacity Estimation
Storage Estimation:
100 billion messages are shared through WhatsApp per day and each message takes 100 bytes on average
100 billion/day∗100 Bytes = 10 TB/day
For 30 days, the storage capacity would become the following:

Capacity Estimation
Storage Estimation:
100 billion messages are shared through WhatsApp per day and each message takes 100 bytes on average
100 billion/day∗100 Bytes = 10 TB/day
For 30 days, the storage capacity would become the following:
---
Bandwidth Estimation:
According to the storage capacity estimation, our service will get 10TB of data each day, giving us a bandwidth of 926 Mb/s.
10 TB/86400sec ≈ 926Mb/s

Number of servers estimation:
WhatsApp handles around 10 million connections on a single server, which seems quite high for a server.
No. of servers = Total connections per day/No. of connections per server = 2 billion/10 million = 200 servers
So, according to the above estimates, we require 200 chat servers.

Now, here comes the responsibility of the group service. The group service keeps all information about users in each group in the system. It has all the information about each group, including user IDs, group ID, status, group icon, number of users, and so on. This service resides on top of the MySQL database cluster, with multiple secondary replicas distributed geographically. A Redis cache server also exists to cache data from the MySQL servers. Both geographically distributed replicas and Redis cache aid in reducing latency.

The group message handler communicates with the group service to retrieve data of Group/A users. In the last step, the group message handler follows the same process as a WebSocket server and delivers the message to each user.

Judgement: Yes
Explanation: The system uses content delivery networks (CDNs) to minimize recomputation or fetching of static data, which is a green practice. By using CDNs, the system can reduce the latency and improve the performance of the application.

The system meets the requirement of consistency by delivering messages in the order they were sent. The system also ensures that messages are persistent stored when a user is offline until the successful delivery of messages. This feature helps to ensure that messages are not lost during the time the user is offline.

In terms of scalability, the system is designed to handle an ever-increasing number of users and messages per day. The estimation shows that the system would require 200 chat servers to handle 2 billion connections per day. This number can be increased or decreased based on the actual usage of the application.

The media file is compressed and encrypted on the device side.
The compressed and encrypted file is sent to the asset service to store the file on blob storage.
The asset service assigns an ID that’s communicated with the sender. The asset service also maintains a hash for each file to avoid duplication of content on the blob storage.
For example, if a user wants to upload an image that’s already there in the blob storage, the image won’t be uploaded. Instead, the same ID is forwarded to the receiver.

,"Consistency: Messages should be delivered in the order they were sent.
Availability: The system should be highly available. However, the availability can be compromised in the interest of consistency.
Security: The system must be secure via end-to-end encryption. The end-to-end encryption ensures that only the two communicating parties can see the content of messages. Nobody in between, not even WhatsApp, should have access.
Scalability: The system should be highly scalable to support an ever-increasing number of users and messages per day.
Capacity Estimation
Storage Estimation:
100 billion messages are shared through WhatsApp per day and each message takes 100 bytes on average
100 billion/day∗100 Bytes = 10 TB/day
For 30 days, the storage capacity would become the following:
---
Bandwidth Estimation:
According to the storage capacity estimation, our service will get 10TB of data each day, giving us a bandwidth of 926 Mb/s.
10 TB/86400sec ≈ 926Mb/s

Number of servers estimation:
WhatsApp handles around 10 million connections on a single server, which seems quite high for a server.
No. of servers = Total connections per day/No. of connections per server = 2 billion/10 million = 200 servers
So, according to the above estimates, we require 200 chat servers.

Now, here comes the responsibility of the group service. The group service keeps all information about users in each group in the system. It has all the information about each group, including user IDs, group ID, status, group icon, number of users, and so on. This service resides on top of the MySQL database cluster, with multiple secondary replicas distributed geographically. A Redis cache server also exists to cache data from the MySQL servers. Both geographically distributed replicas and Redis cache aid in reducing latency.

The group message handler communicates with the group service to retrieve data of Group/A users. In the last step, the group message handler follows the same process as a WebSocket server and delivers the message to each user.

User A sends a message to the chat server.
Upon receiving the message, the chat server acknowledges back to user A.
The chat server sends the message to user B and stores the message in the database if the receiver’s status is offline.
User B sends an acknowledgment to the chat server.
The chat server notifies user A that the message has been successfully delivered.
When user B reads the message, the application notifies the chat server.
The chat server notifies user A that user B has read the message.

The WebSocket manager is responsible for maintaining a mapping between an active user and a port assigned to the user. Whenever a user is connected to another WebSocket server, this information will be updated in the data store. A WebSocket server also communicates with another service called message service.

The media file is compressed and encrypted on the device side.
The compressed and encrypted file is sent to the asset service to store the file on blob storage.
The asset service assigns an ID that’s communicated with the sender. The asset service also maintains a hash for each file to avoid duplication of content on the blob storage.
For example, if a user wants to upload an image that’s already there in the blob storage, the image won’t be uploaded. Instead, the same ID is forwarded to the receiver.
The asset service sends the ID of media files to the receiver via the message service. The receiver downloads the media file from the blob storage using the ID.
The content is loaded onto a CDN if the asset service receives a large number of requests for some particular content.
---
This API is used to send a text message from a sender to a receiver by making a POST API call to the /messages API endpoint. Generally, the sender’s and receiver’s IDs are their phone numbers.

Get Message
getMessage(user_Id)

Using this API call, users can fetch all unread messages when they come online after being offline for some time.

Upload File
uploadFile(file_type, file)

We can upload media files via the uploadFile API by making a POST request to the /v1/media API endpoint. A successful response returns an ID that’s forwarded to the receiver.

Download Media File
downloadFile(user_id, file_id)",2.1044442653656006,"The system design you provided is for a messaging platform similar to WhatsApp. Here are some observations and suggestions based on the architecture and components you described:

1. Load Balancing:
With billions of active users, it's essential to have a robust load balancing mechanism in place to distribute traffic across multiple servers. You can use a combination of hardware and software-based load balancers to ensure that no single server is overwhelmed with requests.
2. Scalability:
To handle the volume of messages, media files, and user data, you'll need to design your system for horizontal scaling. This means adding more servers as needed to increase the overall processing capacity of the system. Consider using containerization technologies like Docker and Kubernetes to make it easier to scale your services.
3. Database Management:
You mentioned that each server has its own data store, which is fine for handling small amounts of data. However, as the number of users grows, you'll need a more robust database management system that can handle large amounts of data across multiple servers. Consider using a distributed database like Apache Cassandra or MongoDB to manage your user data and messages.
4. Messaging Architecture:
Your messaging architecture is relatively simple, with each WebSocket server communicating directly with the message service. While this works for small-scale messaging applications, it may not be sufficient for handling large volumes of traffic. Consider using a more complex messaging architecture like a pub/sub model, where messages are published to a central topic and then routed to the appropriate subscribers.
5. Security:
With billions of users, security is paramount. You should implement robust security measures to protect user data and prevent unauthorized access. Consider using encryption for sensitive data, such as messages and user information, and implementing authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users can access the system.
6. Content Delivery Network (CDN):
To reduce latency and improve performance, consider using a CDN to cache frequently accessed media files and other content. This will help distribute the load across multiple servers and reduce the burden on any single server.
7. Media File Handling:
Your media file handling process is relatively straightforward, with compressed and encrypted files being stored on blob storage. Consider implementing a more sophisticated media file handling mechanism that can handle various types of media files (e.g., images, videos, audio) and provide better quality control and monitoring capabilities.
8. API Design:
Your API design is relatively simple, with a few endpoints for sending and retrieving messages. Consider implementing more complex APIs that can handle more advanced use cases, such as group messaging, video conferencing, and file sharing.
9. Monitoring and Maintenance:
With billions of users, your system will need to be highly available and fault-tolerant. Consider implementing monitoring and maintenance mechanisms that can detect and resolve issues quickly, such as automated backups, log analysis, and performance monitoring tools.
10. Future Scalability:
Finally, consider the long-term scalability of your system. As your user base grows, you'll need to design for additional features and functionalities that will arise in the future. Consider using a modular architecture that can be easily extended or modified as needed.

Overall, your system design is a good starting point for building a messaging platform similar to WhatsApp. However, with billions of users, you'll need to consider more advanced architectural and technical components to ensure scalability, security, and performance.",20.459755659103394,0,"[(Document(page_content='Now, here comes the responsibility of the group service.

,"Consistency: Messages should be delivered in the order they were sent.
Availability: The system should be highly available. However, the availability can be compromised in the interest of consistency.
Security: The system must be secure via end-to-end encryption. The end-to-end encryption ensures that only the two communicating parties can see the content of messages. Nobody in between, not even WhatsApp, should have access.
Scalability: The system should be highly scalable to support an ever-increasing number of users and messages per day.
Capacity Estimation
Storage Estimation:
100 billion messages are shared through WhatsApp per day and each message takes 100 bytes on average
100 billion/day∗100 Bytes = 10 TB/day
For 30 days, the storage capacity would become the following:
---
Bandwidth Estimation:
According to the storage capacity estimation, our service will get 10TB of data each day, giving us a bandwidth of 926 Mb/s.
10 TB/86400sec ≈ 926Mb/s

Number of servers estimation:
WhatsApp handles around 10 million connections on a single server, which seems quite high for a server.
No. of servers = Total connections per day/No. of connections per server = 2 billion/10 million = 200 servers
So, according to the above estimates, we require 200 chat servers.

Requirements
The WhatsApp messenger design should meet below requirements:
---
Functional Requirement
Conversation: The system should support one-on-one and group conversations between users.
Acknowledgment: The system should support message delivery acknowledgment, such as sent, delivered, and read.
Sharing: The system should support sharing of media files, such as images, videos, and audio.
Chat storage: The system must support the persistent storage of chat messages when a user is offline until the successful delivery of messages.
Push notifications: The system should be able to notify offline users of new messages once their status becomes online.
Non-Functional Requirement
Low latency: Users should be able to receive messages with low latency.
Consistency: Messages should be delivered in the order they were sent.
---
Now, here comes the responsibility of the group service. The group service keeps all information about users in each group in the system. It has all the information about each group, including user IDs, group ID, status, group icon, number of users, and so on. This service resides on top of the MySQL database cluster, with multiple secondary replicas distributed geographically. A Redis cache server also exists to cache data from the MySQL servers. Both geographically distributed replicas and Redis cache aid in reducing latency.

The group message handler communicates with the group service to retrieve data of Group/A users. In the last step, the group message handler follows the same process as a WebSocket server and delivers the message to each user.
---
4. Support for Group messages
Since user A is connected to a WebSocket server, it sends a message to the message service intended for Group A.The message service sends the message to Kafka with other specific information about the group. The message is saved there for further processing. In Kafka terminology, a group can be a topic, and the senders and receivers can be producers and consumers, respectively.

The following steps describe the communication between both clients:

User A and user B create a communication channel with the chat server.
User A sends a message to the chat server.
Upon receiving the message, the chat server acknowledges back to user A.
The chat server sends the message to user B and stores the message in the database if the receiver’s status is offline.
User B sends an acknowledgment to the chat server.
The chat server notifies user A that the message has been successfully delivered.
When user B reads the message, the application notifies the chat server.
The chat server notifies user A that user B has read the message.

We will be using microservices architecture since it will make it easier to horizontally scale and decouple our services. Each service will have ownership of its own data model.

Low Level Design (LLD) of System Design
Low-Level-Design(LLD)-of-WhatsApp-Messenger

1. Connection with Websocket Server
In WhatsApp, each active device is connected with a WebSocket server via WebSocket protocol. A WebSocket server keeps the connection open with all the active (online) users. Since one server isn’t enough to handle billions of devices, there should be enough servers to handle billions of users.
---
The responsibility of each of these servers is to provide a port to every online user. The mapping between servers, ports, and users is stored in the WebSocket manager that resides on top of a cluster of the data store. In this case, that’s Redis.

2. Send or receive messages
The WebSocket manager is responsible for maintaining a mapping between an active user and a port assigned to the user. Whenever a user is connected to another WebSocket server, this information will be updated in the data store. A WebSocket server also communicates with another service called message service.
---
For 30 days, the storage capacity would become the following:
30∗10 TB/day = 300 TB/month
---
Message service is a repository of messages on top of the Mnesia database cluster. It acts as an interface to the Mnesia database for other services interacting with the databases. It is responsible for storing and retrieving messages from the Mnesia database. It also deletes messages from the Mnesia database after a configurable amount of time. And, it exposes APIs to receive messages by various filters, such as user ID, message ID, and so on.

3. Send or receive media files
We have another service called the asset service, which is responsible for sending and receiving media files.
---
The media file is compressed and encrypted on the device side.
The compressed and encrypted file is sent to the asset service to store the file on blob storage.
The asset service assigns an ID that’s communicated with the sender. The asset service also maintains a hash for each file to avoid duplication of content on the blob storage.
For example, if a user wants to upload an image that’s already there in the blob storage, the image won’t be uploaded. Instead, the same ID is forwarded to the receiver.
The asset service sends the ID of media files to the receiver via the message service. The receiver downloads the media file from the blob storage using the ID.
The content is loaded onto a CDN if the asset service receives a large number of requests for some particular content.
---
This API is used to send a text message from a sender to a receiver by making a POST API call to the /messages API endpoint. Generally, the sender’s and receiver’s IDs are their phone numbers.

Get Message
getMessage(user_Id)

Using this API call, users can fetch all unread messages when they come online after being offline for some time.

Upload File
uploadFile(file_type, file)

We can upload media files via the uploadFile API by making a POST request to the /v1/media API endpoint. A successful response returns an ID that’s forwarded to the receiver.

Download Media File
downloadFile(user_id, file_id)",2.3043036460876465,"Responsibility of Group Service:
The group service stores all information about users in each group in the system, including user IDs, group ID, status, group icon, number of users, and so on. It resides on top of a MySQL database cluster with multiple secondary replicas distributed geographically. A Redis cache server also exists to cache data from the MySQL servers, which aid in reducing latency. The group message handler communicates with the group service to retrieve data of Group/A users.

Support for Group Messages:
When user A sends a message to the message service intended for Group A, the message is saved in Kafka with other specific information about the group. In Kafka terminology, a group can be a topic, and the senders and receivers can be producers and consumers, respectively.

API Design:
The following steps describe the communication between both clients:

1. User A and user B create a communication channel with the chat server.
2. User A sends a message to the chat server.
3. The chat server acknowledges back to user A.
4. The chat server sends the message to user B and stores the message in the database if the receiver’s status is offline.
5. User B sends an acknowledgment to the chat server.
6. The chat server notifies user A that the message has been successfully delivered.
7. When user B reads the message, the application notifies the chat server.
8. The chat server notifies user A that user B has read the message.

Data Model Design:
The data model design includes the following entities and relationships:

* User
	+ id (primary key)
	+ name
	+ email
	+ status
* Group
	+ id (primary key)
	+ name
	+ icon
	+ numberOfUsers
* Message
	+ id (primary key)
	+ message
	+ senderID
	+ receiverID
	+ type (text, media, document)
	+ createdAt (timestamp)

Architecture:
The architecture consists of multiple services and data stores, including:

1. WebSocket server: responsible for providing a port to every online user.
2. Message service: acts as an interface to the Mnesia database for other services interacting with the databases. It is responsible for storing and retrieving messages from the Mnesia database.
3. Asset service: responsible for sending and receiving media files. It assigns an ID to each file and maintains a hash for each file to avoid duplication of content on blob storage.
4. Group service: stores all information about users in each group in the system, including user IDs, group ID, status, group icon, number of users, and so on.
5. Redis cache server: exists to cache data from the MySQL servers, which aid in reducing latency.
6. Kafka: used for storing and retrieving messages. In Kafka terminology, a group can be a topic, and the senders and receivers can be producers and consumers, respectively.

Low Level Design (LLD):
The LLD includes the following components:

1. WebSocket protocol: used for establishing connections between active devices and the WebSocket server.
2. Mnesia database cluster: used for storing and retrieving messages.

3. Send or receive media files
We have another service called the asset service, which is responsible for sending and receiving media files.",2.106621265411377,"1. What is the role of the group service in the system design?

The group service plays a crucial role in the system design by providing information about users in each group. It maintains data such as user IDs, group ID, status, group icon, number of users, and so on. The group service resides on top of a MySQL database cluster with multiple secondary replicas distributed geographically to reduce latency. Additionally, a Redis cache server exists to cache data from the MySQL servers, further reducing latency.

The group service is responsible for:

* Providing information about users in each group
* Maintaining data consistency across all replicas
* Handling requests related to user status updates, group icon changes, and so on
* Ensuring low latency by using geographically distributed replicas and Redis cache
2. What is the purpose of the WebSocket manager in the system design?

The WebSocket manager is responsible for providing a connection between active devices and the WebSocket server. It maintains a mapping between active users, assigned ports, and the WebSocket servers handling those connections. The WebSocket manager resides on top of a cluster of data store (Redis in this case), which stores information about active users, their assigned ports, and the WebSocket servers handling those connections.

The WebSocket manager is responsible for:

* Maintaining a mapping between active users and assigned ports
* Handling requests related to user connectivity and disconnectivity
* Ensuring efficient communication between active devices and the WebSocket server by using a clustered data store
3. What is the role of the message service in the system design?

The message service acts as an interface to the Mnesia database for other services interacting with the databases. It stores and retrieves messages from the Mnesia database, deletes messages after a configurable amount of time, and exposes APIs to receive messages by various filters such as user ID, message ID, and so on.

The message service is responsible for:

* Storing and retrieving messages from the Mnesia database
* Handling requests related to message retrieval and deletion
* Exposing APIs for message receipt based on user ID, message ID, and other filters
4. How does the asset service handle media file uploads and downloads?

The asset service is responsible for handling media file uploads and downloads. When a user wants to upload an image or any other media file, it is compressed and encrypted on the device side before being sent to the asset service. The asset service assigns an ID to the media file, which is communicated with the sender. The asset service also maintains a hash for each file to avoid duplication of content on blob storage. When a receiver wants to download a media file, the asset service sends the ID of the file to the receiver via the message service. The receiver then downloads the media file from the blob storage using the ID.

The asset service is responsible for:

* Compressing and encrypting media files on the device side before uploading them to the asset service
* Assigning an ID to each media file and communicating it with the sender

Message service is a repository of messages on top of the Mnesia database cluster. It acts as an interface to the Mnesia database for other services interacting with the databases. It is responsible for storing and retrieving messages from the Mnesia database. It also deletes messages from the Mnesia database after a configurable amount of time. And, it exposes APIs to receive messages by various filters, such as user ID, message ID, and so on.

Capacity Estimation
Storage Estimation:
100 billion messages are shared through WhatsApp per day and each message takes 100 bytes on average
100 billion/day∗100 Bytes = 10 TB/day
For 30 days, the storage capacity would become the following:
---
Bandwidth Estimation:
According to the storage capacity estimation, our service will get 10TB of data each day, giving us a bandwidth of 926 Mb/s.
10 TB/86400sec ≈ 926Mb/s

Number of servers estimation:
WhatsApp handles around 10 million connections on a single server, which seems quite high for a server.
No. of servers = Total connections per day/No. of connections per server = 2 billion/10 million = 200 servers
So, according to the above estimates, we require 200 chat servers.

This API is used to send a text message from a sender to a receiver by making a POST API call to the /messages API endpoint. Generally, the sender’s and receiver’s IDs are their phone numbers.

Get Message
getMessage(user_Id)

Using this API call, users can fetch all unread messages when they come online after being offline for some time.

Upload File
uploadFile(file_type, file)

We can upload media files via the uploadFile API by making a POST request to the /v1/media API endpoint. A successful response returns an ID that’s forwarded to the receiver.

Download Media File
downloadFile(user_id, file_id)
---
The media file is compressed and encrypted on the device side.
The compressed and encrypted file is sent to the asset service to store the file on blob storage.
The asset service assigns an ID that’s communicated with the sender. The asset service also maintains a hash for each file to avoid duplication of content on the blob storage.
For example, if a user wants to upload an image that’s already there in the blob storage, the image won’t be uploaded. Instead, the same ID is forwarded to the receiver.
The asset service sends the ID of media files to the receiver via the message service. The receiver downloads the media file from the blob storage using the ID.
The content is loaded onto a CDN if the asset service receives a large number of requests for some particular content.",2.1104066371917725,"1. How does the system handle user authentication and authorization?

The system uses microservices architecture to handle user authentication and authorization. Each service has ownership of its data model, and the WebSocket manager resides on top of a cluster of Redis for storing mapping information between active users, ports, and servers. When a user connects to a WebSocket server, the WebSocket manager updates the mapping information in Redis. The system supports one-on-one and group conversations, message delivery acknowledgment, sharing of media files, chat storage, push notifications, low latency, and consistency.

To handle authentication and authorization, the system uses a combination of techniques:

* User authentication: The system uses a user ID and password for authentication. When a user logs in, they provide their ID and password, and the system verifies them against the stored credentials. If the credentials match, the system grants access to the user's account.
* Authorization: The system uses permissions based on the user's role or group membership to control access to certain features or data. For example, a user in a specific group may have access to certain features that are not available to other users.
2. How does the system handle message delivery and acknowledgment?

The system supports message delivery acknowledgment, such as sent, delivered, and read messages. When a user sends a message, the WebSocket server assigns a message ID and stores it in the data store (Redis). The recipient's WebSocket server receives the message and acknowledges back to the sender with an ""OK"" message. If the recipient is offline, the system stores the message in the data store until the recipient becomes online again, at which point the system delivers the message to the recipient.
3. How does the system handle media file sharing?

The system supports sharing of media files, such as images, videos, and audio. When a user wants to upload a media file, they make a POST request to the /v1/media API endpoint with the file attachment. The asset service stores the file on blob storage and assigns an ID to the file. The asset service sends the ID to the receiver via the message service. The recipient can then download the media file from the blob storage using the ID.
4. How does the system handle chat storage?

The system supports persistent storage of chat messages when a user is offline until the successful delivery of messages. When a user becomes online, the system delivers any new messages to the user. The system also maintains a mapping between active users and ports assigned to them, which is stored in Redis. When a user connects to another WebSocket server, this information is updated in Redis.
5. How does the system handle low latency and consistency?

The system is designed to provide low latency and consistency. The WebSocket protocol uses a persistent connection between the client and server, which allows for efficient communication and low latency. Additionally, the system uses message queuing and delivery mechanisms to ensure that messages are delivered in the order they were sent and that there is no duplicate delivery of messages.
6. Can you explain the architecture of the system?

The system uses a microservices architecture, where each service has ownership of its own data model. The WebSocket manager resides on top of a cluster of Redis for storing mapping information between active users, ports, and servers. Each server handles a subset of users and stores messages in the data store until they are successfully delivered to the recipient. The system also uses a content delivery network (CDN) to distribute media files and reduce latency.
7. How does the system handle offline users?

The system supports notification of offline users of new messages once their status becomes online. When an offline user comes online, the system delivers any new messages to them. The system also maintains a mapping between active users and ports assigned to them, which is stored in Redis. When a user connects to another WebSocket server, this information is updated in Redis.",23.46312665939331,0,"[(Document(page_content='Now, here comes the responsibility of the group service.

Approach to achieve the below system attributes
Requirements
The WhatsApp messenger design should meet below requirements:
---
Functional Requirement
Conversation: The system should support one-on-one and group conversations between users.
Acknowledgment: The system should support message delivery acknowledgment, such as sent, delivered, and read.
Sharing: The system should support sharing of media files, such as images, videos, and audio.
Chat storage: The system must support the persistent storage of chat messages when a user is offline until the successful delivery of messages.
Push notifications: The system should be able to notify offline users of new messages once their status becomes online.
Non-Functional Requirement
Low latency: Users should be able to receive messages with low latency.
Consistency: Messages should be delivered in the order they were sent.
---
Now, here comes the responsibility of the group service. The group service keeps all information about users in each group in the system. It has all the information about each group, including user IDs, group ID, status, group icon, number of users, and so on. This service resides on top of the MySQL database cluster, with multiple secondary replicas distributed geographically. A Redis cache server also exists to cache data from the MySQL servers. Both geographically distributed replicas and Redis cache aid in reducing latency.

The group message handler communicates with the group service to retrieve data of Group/A users. In the last step, the group message handler follows the same process as a WebSocket server and delivers the message to each user.
---
4. Support for Group messages
Since user A is connected to a WebSocket server, it sends a message to the message service intended for Group A.The message service sends the message to Kafka with other specific information about the group. The message is saved there for further processing. In Kafka terminology, a group can be a topic, and the senders and receivers can be producers and consumers, respectively.

The following steps describe the communication between both clients:

User A and user B create a communication channel with the chat server.
User A sends a message to the chat server.
Upon receiving the message, the chat server acknowledges back to user A.
The chat server sends the message to user B and stores the message in the database if the receiver’s status is offline.
User B sends an acknowledgment to the chat server.
The chat server notifies user A that the message has been successfully delivered.
When user B reads the message, the application notifies the chat server.
The chat server notifies user A that user B has read the message.

The responsibility of each of these servers is to provide a port to every online user. The mapping between servers, ports, and users is stored in the WebSocket manager that resides on top of a cluster of the data store. In this case, that’s Redis.

2. Send or receive messages
The WebSocket manager is responsible for maintaining a mapping between an active user and a port assigned to the user. Whenever a user is connected to another WebSocket server, this information will be updated in the data store. A WebSocket server also communicates with another service called message service.

1. Connection with Websocket Server
In WhatsApp, each active device is connected with a WebSocket server via WebSocket protocol. A WebSocket server keeps the connection open with all the active (online) users. Since one server isn’t enough to handle billions of devices, there should be enough servers to handle billions of users.

According to the storage capacity estimation, our service will get 10TB of data each day, giving us a bandwidth of 926 Mb/s.
10 TB/86400sec ≈ 926Mb/s

Number of servers estimation:
WhatsApp handles around 10 million connections on a single server, which seems quite high for a server.
No. of servers = Total connections per day/No. of connections per server = 2 billion/10 million = 200 servers
So, according to the above estimates, we require 200 chat servers.

The media file is compressed and encrypted on the device side.
The compressed and encrypted file is sent to the asset service to store the file on blob storage.
The asset service assigns an ID that’s communicated with the sender. The asset service also maintains a hash for each file to avoid duplication of content on the blob storage.
For example, if a user wants to upload an image that’s already there in the blob storage, the image won’t be uploaded. Instead, the same ID is forwarded to the receiver.
The asset service sends the ID of media files to the receiver via the message service. The receiver downloads the media file from the blob storage using the ID.
The content is loaded onto a CDN if the asset service receives a large number of requests for some particular content.",2.1018059253692627,"1. What are the non-functional requirements for the group messaging feature in WhatsApp?

Low latency: Users should be able to receive messages with low latency.
Consistency: Messages should be delivered in the order they were sent.

2. How does the group message handler communicate with the group service to retrieve data of Group/A users?

The group message handler communicates with the group service to retrieve data of Group/A users by sending a request to Kafka, a distributed streaming platform, with other specific information about the group. The message is saved there for further processing. In Kafka terminology, a group can be a topic, and the senders and receivers can be producers and consumers, respectively.

3. Can you explain the API design for sending a message in WhatsApp?

Sure! Here's an explanation of the API design for sending a message in WhatsApp:

The Send Message API takes in the following parameters:

* message_ID: A unique ID for the message
* sender_ID: The ID of the sender
* receiver_ID: The ID of the receiver
* type: The type of message (e.g., text, media, document)
* text/media/document: The actual message content

The API returns a success response if the message is sent successfully, and an error response if there's an issue with the request.

4. Can you provide more details on the data model design for the group messaging feature in WhatsApp?

Sure! Here are some additional details on the data model design for the group messaging feature in WhatsApp:

The responsibility of each of these servers is to provide a port to every online user. The mapping between servers, ports, and users is stored in the WebSocket manager that resides on top of a cluster of the data store. In this case, that’s Redis.

Each service has ownership of its own data model. For example, the WebSocket server is responsible for maintaining a mapping between an active user and a port assigned to the user, while the message service is responsible for storing and retrieving messages based on their unique IDs.

5. Can you explain how the media file is compressed and encrypted on the device side in WhatsApp?

Sure! Here's an explanation of how the media file is compressed and encrypted on the device side in WhatsApp:

The media file is compressed using a lossless compression algorithm (e.g., JPEG for images, MP3 for audio) to reduce its size without sacrificing quality. This compression is done on the device side before sending the file to the asset service.

Once the file reaches the asset service, it's encrypted using an encryption algorithm (e.g., AES-256) to protect the content from unauthorized access. The encryption key is derived from a user's private key and is never stored on the device or in plaintext.

The encrypted media file is then stored on blob storage, along with an associated ID that's communicated to the receiver. When the receiver downloads the media file, it decrypts it using its own public key, which is derived from its private key and stored securely on the device.",19.809747219085693,0,"[(Document(page_content='Now, here comes the responsibility of the group service.

10 TB/86400sec ≈ 926Mb/s

Number of servers estimation:
WhatsApp handles around 10 million connections on a single server, which seems quite high for a server.
No. of servers = Total connections per day/No. of connections per server = 2 billion/10 million = 200 servers
So, according to the above estimates, we require 200 chat servers.

Approach to achieve the below system attributes
Requirements
The WhatsApp messenger design should meet below requirements:

---

Functional Requirement
Conversation: The system should support one-on-one and group conversations between users.
Acknowledgment: The system should support message delivery acknowledgment, such as sent, delivered, and read.
Sharing: The system should support sharing of media files, such as images, videos, and audio.
Chat storage: The system must support the persistent storage of chat messages when a user is offline until the successful delivery of messages.
Push notifications: The system should be able to notify offline users of new messages once their status becomes online.
Non-Functional Requirement
Low latency: Users should be able to receive messages with low latency.
Consistency: Messages should be delivered in the order they were sent.

---

Now, here comes the responsibility of the group service. The group service keeps all information about users in each group in the system. It has all the information about each group, including user IDs, group ID, status, group icon, number of users, and so on. This service resides on top of the MySQL database cluster, with multiple secondary replicas distributed geographically. A Redis cache server also exists to cache data from the MySQL servers. Both geographically distributed replicas and Redis cache aid in reducing latency.

The group message handler communicates with the group service to retrieve data of Group/A users. In the last step, the group message handler follows the same process as a WebSocket server and delivers the message to each user.

---

4. Support for Group messages
Since user A is connected to a WebSocket server, it sends a message to the message service intended for Group A.The message service sends the message to Kafka with other specific information about the group. The message is saved there for further processing. In Kafka terminology, a group can be a topic, and the senders and receivers can be producers and consumers, respectively.

---

API Design
Send message
sendMessage(message_ID, sender_ID, reciever_ID, type, text=none, media_object=none, document=none)

---

The following steps describe the communication between both clients:

User A and user B create a communication channel with the chat server.
User A sends a message to the chat server.
Upon receiving the message, the chat server acknowledges back to user A.
The chat server sends the message to user B and stores the message in the database if the receiver’s status is offline.
User B sends an acknowledgment to the chat server.
The chat server notifies user A that the message has been successfully delivered.
When user B reads the message, the application notifies the chat server.
The chat server notifies user A that user B has read the message.

Architecture
We will be using microservices architecture since it will make it easier to horizontally scale and decouple our services. Each service will have ownership of its own data model.

1. Connection with Websocket Server
In WhatsApp, each active device is connected with a WebSocket server via WebSocket protocol. A WebSocket server keeps the connection open with all the active (online) users. Since one server isn’t enough to handle billions of devices, there should be enough servers to handle billions of users.

---

The responsibility of each of these servers is to provide a port to every online user. The mapping between servers, ports, and users is stored in the WebSocket manager that resides on top of a cluster of the data store. In this case, that’s Redis.

2. Send or receive messages
The WebSocket manager is responsible for maintaining a mapping between an active user and a port assigned to the user. Whenever a user is connected to another WebSocket server, this information will be updated in the data store. A WebSocket server also communicates with another service called message service.
