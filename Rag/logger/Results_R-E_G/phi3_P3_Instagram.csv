10. Scalability for Instagram System Design
Scalability refers to the ability of an organization (or a system, such as a computer network) to perform well under an increased or expanding workload. A system that scales well will be able to maintain or increase its level of performance even as it is tested by larger and larger operational demands.

We can add more servers to application service layers to make the scalability better and handle numerous requests from the clients. We can also increase the number of databases to store the growing users’ data.

If the user is new, they will register firstly it will be store in database, they will verifiy the profile.
If user is already signup, they will provide the email-Id and Password.
On the home page they will get the photos and videos, as well as the story page.
The post which is posted now, it will come at the top. User can follow or unfollow the person. User can get live. It’s all depend on them.
There will be setting, in which user can see there past story or the post which has been archive. User can unblock the person they can get verified account, after paying.

While it mentions using scalable object storage solutions like Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, or Azure Blob Storage to store photos and videos efficiently and reliably, there is no specific mention of implementing strategies for optimizing the usage of this storage space beyond ensuring redundancy and disaster recovery mechanisms are in place. For a comprehensive low-level design focusing on optimization of storage utilization along with other requirements like scalability, latency improvement through caching/CDNs, availability using global replication strategies among others as mentioned:

```markdown
## Low-Level Design (LLD) for Instagram System Optimized Storage Utilization 
---
The design will include components and interactions that not only fulfill the basic functional requirements but also consider storage optimization. Here's an extended breakdown of these aspects:

1. **Storage Service** - Efficient handling, compression before storing uploaded content to save space (photos and videos), employing deduplication strategies where similar media are stored once minimally without loss of quality/size increase being significant for users experience as this is typically only relevant in scenarios with very high duplicate uploads.
    ```javascript
    function compressAndStore(file) {
        // Convert the file into a compressed format, e.g., JPEG or WebP to reduce space usage
        let content = FileCompressor.compressFileToJpegOrWebp(file); 
        StorageService.storeEfficiently('photos', content);  
    }
    ```
2. **Search Service** - Indexing based on metadata (tags, captions) to help identify and store similar or duplicate items in a more space-efficient manner while reducing redundant storage needs across multiple replicas/regions by ensuring only unique instances of the same content exist within each geographic location's dataset.
    ```javascript
    function indexWithMetadata(content, metadata) {
        // Indexing with additional filters on tags and captions to group duplicates together 
        SearchService.createIndex('photos', 'metadata-index', [content, metadata], DeduplicationStrategy);  
    }
    ```
3. **Comment Service** - Implement comment deduplication strategy where multiple identical comments are stored only once and references (pointers) to their original post/user interaction points used instead of duplicating the actual data. This will reduce storage space needed for redundant textual content across large numbers of posts or user interactions that result in similar replies, questions, etc.
    ```javascript
    function storeDeduplicatedComments() {
        // Storing comments once and storing references to them instead 
        CommentService.createCommentReferenceStore();  
    }
    ```
4. **Notification Service** - Optimization can include batching notifications for similar types of updates (e.g., multiple likes/comments in one notification) or using a lazy-loading strategy where not all comments are loaded initially, but on user's request like scrolling down the feed to see more comments about certain posts which triggers data retrieval from databases and then caching this locally as well for quicker subsequent access without additional load.
    ```javascript
    function batchNotifications() { 
        // Batching similar notification types (e.g., multiple likes/comments on a single post) into one, reducing overall network requests to the server  
        NotificationService.createBatchedNotification('post-likes');  
    }
    
    function lazyLoadComments() { 
        // Loading comments only when user scrolls down and then caching locally for quicker subsequent access without additional load on initial requesting phase of content retrieval from databases, which optimizes server usage.
        NotificationService.createLazyLoadingStrategy('comments-post');  
    }
    
5. **Caching Layer** - Utilize advanced in-memory caching mechanisms like Redis with custom eviction policies tailored to Instagram’s specific content access patterns and high traffic, which can help improve latency by reducing the need for database or external storage lookups when serving frequently accessed data such as popular posts/users.
    ```javascript
    function utilizeAdvancedCaching() { 
        // Implementing caching with custom eviction policies based on content access patterns and high traffic, minimizing redundant load-retrieval cycles for hot items like top trending photos or most viewed users by frequently accessed data stored in Redis  
        CacheService.createRedisWithCustomEvictionPolicy(); 
    }
    
6. **Replication/Global Distribution** - Use of geographically distributed replicas with intelligent synchronization and content de-duplication strategies across regions, ensuring that each region maintains its own cache layer while keeping a single instance per unique piece of media to minimize redundant data storage requirements within the system as well.
    ```javascript
    function createGeographicallyDistributedReplicas() { 
        // Implementing intelligent synchronization and content de-duplication across geographically distributed replicas/regions, ensuring that each region maintains its own cache layer while keeping a single instance per unique piece of media to minimize redundant data storage requirements within the system  
        ReplicationService.createGeographicalReplicaAndDistribution(); 
   0. **Scalability** - Employ auto-scaling policies for all services and implement database sharding strategies based on content type or user base region which allows better distribution of load across available resources, ensuring that storage demands are balanced effectively without overloading any single point in the system while maintaining optimal performance.
    ```javascript 
    function autoScalableAndShardedInfrastructure() {
        // Implement scalability and sharding strategies to better distribute load across available resources, allowing for effective management of storage demands by distributing them based on content type or user region  
        InfrastructureService.createAutoScalingPolicy(); 
    }
    
7. **Data Compression** - Implement data compression algorithms suitable for different media types to further optimize the use of available space, which reduces storage requirements without impacting users' viewability/experience significantly and can be selectively applied based on user’s device capabilities or preferences (such as high-resolution photos that are not frequently viewed being stored in a more compressed format).
    ```javascript 
    
    function compressDataForStorage() {
        // Implement data compression algorithms suitable for different media types, reducing storage requirements without impacting users' viewability/experience significantly. Compression can be selectively applied based on user’s device capabilities or preferences (e.g., high-resolution photos that are not frequently viewed being stored in a more compressed format)  
        StorageService.applySelectiveCompression('photos'); 
    }
    
8. **User Activity Monitoring** - Implement user activity monitoring to predict and manage peak times, which could involve temporarily increasing storage allocation/bandwidth resources during expected traffic surges or utilizing more aggressive caching strategies that pre-loads popular content into cache before the demand spike while scaling down when there's low usage.
    ```javascript 
    
    function monitorUserActivityAndOptimizeResources() {
        // Monitor user activity to predict and manage peak times, increasing storage allocation/bandwidth resources during expected traffic surges or employing more aggressive caching strategies for popular content before the demand spike while scaling down when there's low usage  
        ActivityMonitorService.createUserActivityBasedResourceManagement(); 
    }    
```
Please note that this extended design document now includes advanced techniques and considerations beyond just optimizing storage utilization, including scalability strategies to maintain performance under varying loads (auto-scaling), a more detailed caching approach using Redis with custom eviction policies for high traffic scenarios, global distribution of replicas/data across regions in addition to deduplication within the comment service and intelligent notification systems.
```

Is there any mention of optimizing average CPU utilization?,"These requirements has been covered:
Scalability: We can add more servers to application service layers to make the scalability better and handle numerous requests from the clients. We can also increase the number of databases to store the growing users’ data.
Latency: The use of cache and CDNs have reduced the content fetching time.
Availability: We have made the system available to the users by using the storage and databases that are replicated across the globe.
Durability: We have persistent storage that maintains the backup of the data so any uploaded content (photos and videos) never gets lost.

Microservices – also known as the microservice architecture – is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of services that are:

Independently deployable
Loosely coupled
Organized around business capabilities
Owned by a small team
The microservice architecture enables an organization to deliver large, complex applications rapidly, frequently, reliably and sustainably – a necessity for competing and winning in today’s world.

---

Notification Service:
Informs users about relevant events like likes, comments, mentions, and follows.
Pushes notifications to mobile devices through platforms like Firebase Cloud Messaging or Amazon SNS.
Leverages a queueing system for asynchronous notification delivery.
Analytics Service:
Tracks user engagement, post performance, and overall platform usage.
Gathers data on views, likes, comments, shares, and clicks.
Provides insights to improve user experience, optimize content recommendations, and target advertising.
Why we need caching for storing the data?
Cache the data to handle millions of reads. It improves the user experience by making the fetching process fast. We’ll also opt for lazy loading, which minimizes the client’s waiting time.

---

API Endpoints:

GET /posts/{post_id}: Retrieves details of a post, including the number of likes/dislikes.
POST /posts/{post_id}/like: Registers a like for the post by the authenticated user.
POST /posts/{post_id}/dislike: Registers a dislike for the post by the authenticated user.
DELETE /posts/{post_id}/like: Removes the like for the post by the authenticated user (if previously done).
DELETE /posts/{post_id}/dislike: Removes the dislike for the post by the authenticated user (if previously done).

---

Post photos and videos: The users can post photos and videos on Instagram.
Follow and unfollow users: The users can follow and unfollow other users on Instagram.
Like or dislike posts: The users can like or dislike posts of the accounts they follow.
Search photos and videos: The users can search photos and videos based on captions and location.
Generate news feed: The users can view the news feed consisting of the photos and videos (in chronological order) from all the users they follow.
2.2 Non-Functional requirements for Instagram System Design
Scalability: The system should be scalable to handle millions of users in terms of computational resources and storage.
Latency: The latency to generate a news feed should be low.
Availability: The system should be highly available.

---

If the user is new, they will register firstly it will be store in database, they will verifiy the profile.
If user is already signup, they will provide the email-Id and Password.
On the home page they will get the photos and videos, as well as the story page.
The post which is posted now, it will come at the top. User can follow or unfollow the person. User can get live. It’s all depend on them.
There will be setting, in which user can see there past story or the post which has been archive. User can unblock the person they can get verified account, after paying.
5. Low-Level Design(LLD) for Instagram System Design
design-instagram-lld

Here’s a breakdown of the key components and interactions for Instagram’s low-level design:

---

Availability: The system should be highly available.
Durability: Any uploaded content (photos and videos) should never get lost.
Consistency: We can compromise a little on consistency. It is acceptable if the content (photos or videos) takes time to show in followers’ feeds located in a distant region.
Reliability: The system must be able to tolerate hardware and software failures.
3. Capacity Estimation for Instagram System Design
We have 1 billion users, with 500 million as daily active users. Assume 60 million photos and 35 million videos are shared on Instagram per day. We can consider 3 MB as the maximum size of each photo and 150 MB as the maximum size of each video uploaded on Instagram.On average, each user sends 20 requests (of any type) per day to our service.

Consistency: We can compromise a little on consistency. It is acceptable if the content (photos or videos) takes time to show in followers’ feeds located in a distant region.
Reliability: The system must be able to tolerate hardware and software failures.
3. Capacity Estimation for Instagram System Design
We have 1 billion users, with 500 million as daily active users. Assume 60 million photos and 35 million videos are shared on Instagram per day. We can consider 3 MB as the maximum size of each photo and 150 MB as the maximum size of each video uploaded on Instagram.On average, each user sends 20 requests (of any type) per day to our service.

Microservices – also known as the microservice architecture – is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of services that are:

Independently deployable
Loosely coupled
Organized around business capabilities
Owned by a small team
The microservice architecture enables an organization to deliver large, complex applications rapidly, frequently, reliably and sustainably – a necessity for competing and winning in today’s world.

API Endpoints:

GET /posts/{post_id}: Retrieves details of a post, including the number of likes/dislikes.
POST /posts/{post_id}/like: Registers a like for the post by the authenticated user.
POST /posts/{post_id}/dislike: Registers a dislike for the post by the authenticated user.
DELETE /posts/{post_id}/like: Removes the like for the post by the authenticated user (if previously done).
DELETE /posts/{post_id}/dislike: Removes the dislike for the post by the authenticated user (if previously done).

Feed Generation adjusts based on changed relationships.
User monitors activity:
Client checks notifications feed.
Notifications provide updates on relevant events.
Key Design Considerations:

---

3.1 Storage Per Day
Photos: 60 million photos/day * 3 MB = 180 TeraBytes / day
Videos: 35 million videos/day * 150 MB = 5250 TB / day
Total content size = 180 + 5250 = 5430 TB
The Total Space required for a Year:
5430 TB/day * 365 (days a year) = 1981950 TB = 1981.95 PetaBytes

3.2 Bandwidth Estimation
5430 TB/(24 * 60* 60) = 5430 TB/86400 sec ~= 62.84 GB/s ~= 502.8 Gbps
Incoming bandwidth ~= 502.8 Gbps
Let’s say the ratio of readers to writers is 100:1.
Required outgoing bandwidth ~= 100 * 502.8 Gbps ~= 50.28 Tbps

Use Case Diagram Instagram

In the above Diagram we have discussed about the use case diagram of Instagram:

---

User Service:
Handles user registration, login, authentication, and profile management.
Stores user data like username, email, bio, profile picture, etc.
Integrates with social authentication providers (e.g., Facebook, Google).
Post Service:
Handles photo and video uploads, editing, and deletion.
Stores post metadata like caption, hashtags, location, timestamp, etc.Processes uploaded media for resizing, filtering, and thumbnail generation.
Manages photo and video transcoding for different devices and resolutions.
Feed Service:
Generates personalized news feeds for each user based on their follows, likes, activity, and engagement.
Leverages a distributed system like Apache Kafka or RabbitMQ for real-time updates and notifications.

---

If the user is new, they will register firstly it will be store in database, they will verifiy the profile.
If user is already signup, they will provide the email-Id and Password.
On the home page they will get the photos and videos, as well as the story page.
The post which is posted now, it will come at the top. User can follow or unfollow the person. User can get live. It’s all depend on them.
There will be setting, in which user can see there past story or the post which has been archive. User can unblock the person they can get verified account, after paying.
5. Low-Level Design(LLD) for Instagram System Design
design-instagram-lld

Here’s a breakdown of the key components and interactions for Instagram’s low-level design:

---

Availability: The system should be highly available.
Durability: Any uploaded content (photos and videos) should never get lost.
Consistency: We can compromise a little on consistency. It is acceptable if the content (photos or videos) takes time to show in followers’ feeds located in a distant region.
Reliability: The system must be able to tolerate hardware and software failures.
3. Capacity Estimation for Instagram System Design
We have 1 billion users, with 500 million as daily active users. Assume 60 million photos and 35 million videos are shared on Instagram per day. We can consider 3 MB as the maximum size of each photo and 150 MB as the maximum size of each video uploaded on Instagram.On average, each user sends 20 requests (of any type) per day to our service.

---

Reliability: Our databases handle replication and redundancy, so our system stays reliable and data is not lost. The load balancing layer routes requests around failed servers.

If the user is new, they will register firstly it will be store in database, they will verifiy the profile.
If user is already signup, they will provide the email-Id and Password.
On the home page they will get the photos and videos, as well as the story page.
The post which is posted now, it will come at the top. User can follow or unfollow the person. User can get live. It’s all depend on them.
There will be setting, in which user can see there past story or the post which has been archive. User can unblock the person they can get verified account, after paying.
5. Low-Level Design(LLD) for Instagram System Design
design-instagram-lld

Here’s a breakdown of the key components and interactions for Instagram’s low-level design:

---

Availability: The system should be highly available.
Durability: Any uploaded content (photos and videos) should never get lost.
Consistency: We can compromise a little on consistency. It is acceptable if the content (photos or videos) takes time to show in followers’ feeds located in a distant region.
Reliability: The system must be able to tolerate hardware and software failures.
3. Capacity Estimation for Instagram System Design
We have 1 billion users, with 500 million as daily active users. Assume 60 million photos and 35 million videos are shared on Instagram per day. We can consider 3 MB as the maximum size of each photo and 150 MB as the maximum size of each video uploaded on Instagram.On average, each user sends 20 requests (of any type) per day to our service.

Endpoints:

POST /users/{user_id}/follow: Follows the specified user.
DELETE /users/{user_id}/follow: Unfollows the specified user.
GET /users/{user_id}/following: Retrieves a list of users followed by the specified user (paginated).
GET /users/{user_id}/followers: Retrieves a list of users following the specified user (paginated).

7.3 Like or Dislike posts
Designing an API for liking and disliking posts involves multiple considerations. Here’s a breakdown of key aspects to think about:

API Endpoints:",7.566247940063477," The low-level design (LLD) document provided does not explicitly address the scalability aspect in terms of independently scaling logical components. However, it discusses system availability, durability, consistency, reliability, capacity estimation for users and content uploads per day on average basis along with endpoints needed to manage user interactions such as following or unfollowing a particular Instagram User Id.

To accommodate scalability in terms of independently scaling logical components within the LLD document provided can be inferred from discussions around Availability, Durability and Consistency across different regions (globally). This suggests that there is some level of horizontal partitioning or distribution to manage user interactions like follows/unfollows. However for a comprehensive understanding on independent scaling components in this context such as load balancers, database sharding etc., explicit details are required from the document which currently seems not included based upon provided LLD design text only. 

Regarding API Endpoints: The endpoints mentioned primarily focuses around user interactions like follows and unfollows without a clear mention of liking or disliking posts in given context as per information available so far. If there are separate endpoints for this, it would need to be explicitly defined within the design document itself that wasn't provided herein. 

End-users could potentially interact with API like below:
POST /posts/{post_id}/like and DELETE /posts/{post_id}/dislike - Likes or dislikes a post identified by its unique ID, respectively. These endpoints would handle the logic for incrementing/decrementing 'likes' count in the database linked to this specific Post Id.

7.3 Like or Dislike posts
Designing an API for liking and disliking posts involves multiple considerations. Here’s a breakdown of key aspects to think about:

API Endpoints:",25.71950387954712," There is no explicit mention of adopting serverless cloud services in the provided text for Instagram's system design and capacity estimation. The detailed information focuses on scalability, latency reduction techniques like caching and CDN usage (which are indirectly related to using such services), as well as availability, durability, consistency requirements without explicitly mentioning serverless technology adoption in the context of low-level or system design discussions within this text.

If Instagram were considering a transition towards serverless cloud services for handling follow/unfollow functionality and like/dislike operations, it would likely involve examining how such an approach could improve scalability, latency, availability (given its global user base), reliability (considering potential failures in demand spikes during events or high-profile posts) without having to manage server instances directly.

To ensure a smooth transition and maintain the system's performance characteristics outlined—scalability for growing users’ data, low latency with near real-time interactions like likes/dislikes (following implications), availability across different regions due to Instagram's worldwide user base, durability in preserving actions such as follows or dislikes even after unexpected system failures—a thorough investigation into serverless services and their architectural patterns would be essential.

This analysis might include: 
- Evaluating how a cloud provider’s Lambda functions could handle individual API requests for liking/unliking actions without managing servers, thus improving scalability by abstracted resources allocation based on demand automatically; 
- Review if serverless architectures can provide the low latency expected with immediate updates to liked statuses through optimizations in cold start times or improved execution paths within a Lambda environment. This aspect is critical because user interactions like liking/disliking are time-sensitive and need real-time reflection on follower feeds; 
- Understanding global availability benefits since serverless platforms inherently manage auto-scaling across regions, which aligns with Instagram's goal of high accessibility worldwide. This would ensure that users from different parts can experience uninterrupted service during peak times or in case of local outages; and 
- Investigating the consistency model offered by serverless providers to ascertain if it meets durability requirements, ensuring follow/unfollow actions are reliably recorded despite potential spikes. This might involve configuring Lambda functions for better idempotent operations or setting up queues that decouple function execution from data updates in the backend database systems where these likes and dislikes persist (ensuring no loss of action records).
- Lastly, exploring how serverless architectures can enhance reliability by offering built-in fault tolerance mechanisms like retry policies or dead letter queues to handle possible transient failures without impacting user experience. These strategies would ensure the system remains responsive and robust during unexpected issues such as temporary spikes in traffic, which is particularly relevant for social media applications that can quickly accumulate high volumes of interactions simultaneously across their platforms (photos/videos uploads, comments).",63.39637351036072,0,"[Document(page_content='Microservices – also known as the microservice architecture – is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of services that are:\n\nIndependently deployable\nLoosely coupled\nOrganized around business capabilities\nOwned by a small team\nThe microservice architecture enables an organization to deliver large, complex applications rapidly, frequently, reliably and sustainably – a necessity for competing and winning in today’s world.', metadata={'source': 'documentsFromText/Instagram/content.txt', 'id': 'documentsFromText/Instagram/content.txt:None:24'}), Document(page_content='Notification Service:\nInforms users about relevant events like likes, comments, mentions, and follows.\nPushes notifications to mobile devices through platforms like Firebase Cloud Messaging or Amazon SNS.\nLeverages a queueing system for asynchronous notification delivery.\nAnalytics Service:\nTracks user engagement, post performance, and overall platform usage.\nGathers data on views, likes, comments, shares, and clicks.\nProvides insights to improve user experience, optimize content recommendations, and target advertising.\nWhy we need caching for storing the data?\nCache the data to handle millions of reads.

It is essential to choose the right kind of database for our Instagram system, but which is the right choice — SQL or NoSQL? Our data is inherently relational, and we need an order for the data (posts should appear in chronological order) and no data loss even in case of failures (data durability). Moreover, in our case, we would benefit from relational queries like fetching the followers or images based on a user ID. Hence, SQL-based databases fulfill these requirements.

It allows us to load the content when the user scrolls and therefore save the bandwidth and focus on loading the content the user is currently viewing. It improves the latency to view or search a particular photo or video on Instagram.
6. High-Level Design(HLD) for Instagram System Design
Our system should allow us to upload, view, and search images and videos at a high level. To upload images and videos, we need to store them, and upon fetching, we need to retrieve the data from the storage. Moreover, the users should also be allowed to follow each other.

These requirements has been covered:
Scalability: We can add more servers to application service layers to make the scalability better and handle numerous requests from the clients. We can also increase the number of databases to store the growing users’ data.
Latency: The use of cache and CDNs have reduced the content fetching time.
Availability: We have made the system available to the users by using the storage and databases that are replicated across the globe.
Durability: We have persistent storage that maintains the backup of the data so any uploaded content (photos and videos) never gets lost.
Consistency: We have used storage like blob stores and databases to keep our data consistent globally.

---

Utilizes a cache layer like Redis for fast feed retrieval and reduced database load.
Storage Service:
Stores uploaded photos and videos efficiently and reliably.
Utilizes a scalable object storage solution like Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, or Azure Blob Storage.
Implements redundancy and disaster recovery mechanisms for data protection.
Search Service:
Enables searching for users, hashtags, and locations.
Indexes users, posts, and hashtags based on relevant parameters.
Employs efficient indexing and search algorithms for fast and accurate results.
Comment Service:
Handles adding, editing, and deleting comments on posts.
Tracks comment threads and parent-child relationships.
Notifies users of new comments on their own posts or comments they participated in.
Notification Service:

Availability: The system should be highly available.
Durability: Any uploaded content (photos and videos) should never get lost.
Consistency: We can compromise a little on consistency. It is acceptable if the content (photos or videos) takes time to show in followers’ feeds located in a distant region.
Reliability: The system must be able to tolerate hardware and software failures.

7.2 Follow and unfollow users
Here’s a potential API design for following and unfollowing users on Instagram:",7.795912265777588," The provided low-level design (LLD) document does not explicitly mention the implementation of settings to see past stories or posts that have been archived. This feature is typically handled through a separate section in an application's user interface, where users can navigate to their activity history and choose what content they want to view again. However, such functionality would require back-end support for retrieving these stored activities efficiently when requested by the user from within this UI component of Instagram or similar social media platforms.

As no specific code snippet is given in your document related to archiving settings and their storage policies, I can't provide a precise answer regarding whether such functionality has been implemented based on what you provided here about LLD design for an Instagram system. In practice though, data management principles suggest that any user-specific preferences should be stored with respects to the privacy of users while ensuring they have control over their content and interaction history within a social platform like Instagram.

If your application requires setting storage retention policies (for example, how long stories or posts are kept before being automatically deleted), this would typically involve implementing logic in both the server-side API endpoints responsible for handling story/post creation as well as user preferences settings where they can manually set these timers. This involves designing additional features and ensuring that your system's data management practices, such as indexing or utilizing a database with specific retention policies like Amazon S3’s lifecycle policies when using cloud storage services.

Is there any mention of prioritizing critical traffic and shedding lower priority traffic?,"These requirements has been covered:
Scalability: We can add more servers to application service layers to make the scalability better and handle numerous requests from the clients. We can also increase the number of databases to store the growing users’ data.
Latency: The use of cache and CDNs have reduced the content fetching time.
Availability: We have made the system available to the users by using the storage and databases that are replicated across the globe.
Durability: We have persistent storage that maintains the backup of the data so any uploaded content (photos and videos) never gets lost.
Consistency: We have used storage like blob stores and databases to keep our data consistent globally.

Microservices – also known as the microservice architecture – is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of services that are:

Independently deployable
Loosely coupled
Organized around business capabilities
Owned by a small team
The microservice architecture enables an organization to deliver large, complex applications rapidly, frequently, reliably and sustainably – a necessity for competing and winning in today’s world.

---

API Endpoints:

GET /posts/{post_id}: Retrieves details of a post, including the number of likes/dislikes.
POST /posts/{post_id}/like: Registers a like for the post by the authenticated user.
POST /posts/{post_id}/dislike: Registers a dislike for the post by the authenticated user.
DELETE /posts/{post_id}/like: Removes the like for the post by the authenticated user (if previously done).
DELETE /posts/{post_id}/dislike: Removes the dislike for the post by the authenticated user (if previously done).

Feed Generation adjusts based on changed relationships.
User monitors activity:
Client checks notifications feed.
Notifications provide updates on relevant events.
Key Design Considerations:

---

3.1 Storage Per Day
Photos: 60 million photos/day * 3 MB = 180 TeraBytes / day
Videos: 35 million videos/day * 150 MB = 5250 TB / day
Total content size = 180 + 5250 = 5430 TB
The Total Space required for a Year:
5430 TB/day * 365 (days a year) = 1981950 TB = 1981.95 PetaBytes

3.2 Bandwidth Estimation
5430 TB/(24 * 60* 60) = 5430 TB/86400 sec ~= 62.84 GB/s ~= 502.8 Gbps
Incoming bandwidth ~= 502.8 Gbps
Let’s say the ratio of readers to writers is 100:1.
Required outgoing bandwidth ~= 100 * 502.8 Gbps ~= 50.28 Tbps

In the above Diagram we have discussed about the use case diagram of Instagram:

---

If the user is new, they will register firstly it will be store in database, they will verifiy the profile.
If user is already signup, they will provide the email-Id and Password.
On the home page they will get the photos and videos, as well as the story page.
The post which is posted now, it will come at the top. User can follow or unfollow the person. User can get live. It’s all depend on them.
There will be setting, in which user can see there past story or the post which has been archive. User can unblock the person they can get verified account, after paying.
5. Low-Level Design(LLD) for Instagram System Design

Here’s a breakdown of the key components and interactions for Instagram’s low-level design:

---

Availability: The system should be highly available.
Durability: Any uploaded content (photos and videos) should never get lost.
Consistency: We can compromise a little on consistency. It is acceptable if the content (photos or videos) takes time to show in followers’ feeds located in a distant region.
Reliability: The system must be able to tolerate hardware and software failures.

    print('Upload failed:', response.text)
    print('Error details:', response.json())  # Display any error details
7.2 Follow and unfollow users
Here’s a potential API design for following and unfollowing users on Instagram:

---

Post photos and videos: The users can post photos and videos on Instagram.
Follow and unfollow users: The users can follow and unfollow other users on Instagram.
Like or dislike posts: The users can like or dislike posts of the accounts they follow.
Search photos and videos: The users can search photos and videos based on captions and location.
Generate news feed: The users can view the news feed consisting of the photos and videos (in chronological order) from all the users they follow.

Notification Service:
Informs users about relevant events like likes, comments, mentions, and follows.
Pushes notifications to mobile devices through platforms like Firebase Cloud Messaging or Amazon SNS.
Leverages a queueing system for asynchronous notification delivery.
Analytics Service:
Tracks user engagement, post performance, and overall platform usage.
Gathers data on views, likes, comments, shares, and clicks.
Provides insights to improve user experience, optimize content recommendations, and target advertising.
Why we need caching for storing the data?
Cache the data to handle millions of reads. It improves the user experience by making the fetching process fast. We’ll also opt for lazy loading, which minimizes the client’s waiting time.

7.3 Like or Dislike posts
Designing an API for liking and disliking posts involves multiple considerations. Here’s a breakdown of key aspects to think about:

API Endpoints:",13.824538469314575," I'm sorry, but your request seems incomplete or unclear in some parts as it references content such as ""design-instagram-lld"" and a URL without providing the actual files or descriptions. Since these specific details are missing from our conversation so far, let me address other aspects of Instagram system design based on standard practices up to my last update:

--- Liking/Disliking Posts ---
To implement an API for liking and disliking posts, you would need two endpoints. Here’s a high-level idea with code examples in Python using Flask (a lightweight web framework):

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/post/<int:post_id>/like', methods=['POST'])
def like_post(post_id):
    post = get_post_by_id(post_id)  # Function to retrieve the post using its ID
    if not post or user_has_already_liked(user.id, post.owner.id):
        return jsonify({""message"": ""Post already liked""}), 403
    
    like = Like()  # Assuming a predefined 'Like' object to represent the action of liking
    db.session.add(like)
    user_likes.append(like)  # Adds this new `like` instance into our local list (or database collection if persisting data).
    
    return jsonify({""message"": ""Post liked successfully"", ""post_id"": post_id, ""user_id"": current_user.id}), 201

@app.route('/post/<int:post_id>/dislike', methods=['POST'])
def dislike_post(post_id):
    # Similar to the like endpoint but with a 'Dislike' object and handling for both likes and dislikes (if supported).
    pass  # Complete this function following similar logic as in `like_post`.
```
For circuit breaker patterns, while not mentioned directly regarding Instagram APIs, implementing such patterns is beneficial to ensure system resilience. Circuit breakers prevent a failing service from causing cascading failures within your application by temporarily 'opening' the connection when certain failure thresholds are met (e.g., too many errors in API requests).

Here’s an abstract way of implementing circuit-breaker pattern using Python:
```python
from exc import RetryLimitExceeded  # Custom exception for exceeded retries, implement as needed.
import time
# ... rest of your imports and code setup...
MAX_ATTEMPTS = 5
FAILURE_DELAY = 2  # seconds delay between attempts in case of a failure (simplistic version)
def api_call(endpoint):
    for attempt in range(1, MAX_ATTEMPTS + 1):
        try:
            response = requests.post(url+endpoint)  # or any other request method as required by the API design specification
            
            if response.status_code == 200:
                return response.json()
                
            elif attempt < MAX_ATTEMPTS:
                time.sleep(FAILURE_DELAY * (attempt + 1))  # Exponential backoff for example purposes only, not included in the default implementation here.
                
        except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
            if attempt == MAX_ATTEMPTS:
                raise RetryLimitExceeded(""Failed to send request after multiple attempts"") from e  # Raise custom exception on exceeding max retries or when the error persists even with a backoff delay (if applicable).
```
When designing such patterns, it’s essential to decide failure conditions based on HTTP status codes and errors. Circuit breakers should reset after some time if no failures occur within that period - typically this is implemented using timed checks or external monitoring tools like Hystrix in Java ecosystems (or similar Python libraries).

Remember, when creating endpoints for liking/disliking posts as well as the overall API design and resilience patterns such as circuit breakers, you must also consider security best practices. This includes authentication mechanisms to verify user identity before allowing them to like or dislike a post (OAuth tokens), data validation on client requests, rate limiting to prevent abuse of your services, CORS policies for browser compatibility issues with cross-origin resource sharing where needed and more.

This answer provides the starting point based on standard API design principles while also highlighting an approach towards implementing circuit breaker patterns not explicitly mentioned in our direct request but widely recognized as good practice when building APIs to handle failures gracefully, ensuring system stability. However, for a complete implementation tailored specifically for Instagram or any other complex social media platform's functionality would require comprehensive knowledge of their specific requirements and existing infrastructure which are beyond the scope of this response without more concrete details on your project setup.

3.1 Storage Per Day
Photos: 60 million photos/day * 3 MB = 180 TeraBytes / day
Videos: 35 million videos/day * 150 MB = 5250 TB / day
Total content size = 180 + 5250 = 5430 TB
The Total Space required for a Year:
5430 TB/day * 365 (days a year) = 1981950 TB = 1981.95 PetaBytes

3.2 Bandwidth Estimation
5430 TB/(24 * 60* 60) = 5430 TB/86400 sec ~= 62.84 GB/s ~= 502.8 Gbps
Incoming bandwidth ~= 502.8 Gbps
Let’s say the ratio of readers to writers is 100:1.

However, Instagram is a cloud-based service and generally follows best practices in implementing robust security measures within the cloud infrastructure which includes network tools and controls for ens014:

--- To improve scalability while handling millions of users simultaneously generating content on social media platforms like Instagram requires an architecture that can dynamically adjust to varying loads, allowing it not only to serve a large number of requests concurrently but also efficiently scale up or down as needed without service disruption. Here are some design considerations and strategies:

1. **Distributed Systems Architecture** - Implementing microservices which allows different functionalities like user management, content delivery, and data analytics to run independently with container orchestration tools such as Kubernetes for better resource utilization and easier scaling across multiple containers or pods on commodity hardware clusters.

2. **Load Balancing** - Employ load balancers that distribute traffic evenly across servers based on current server loads, which prevents any single point of failure and optimizes the response time by routing requests to less busy machines when possible. 

3. **Content Delivery Network (CDN)**: Integrating a CDN reduces latency for end-users globally as it caches static content at edge locations closer to where users are accessing Instagram, reducing travel distance between the server and user significantly. This also provides redundancy in case of regional outages or spikes that could otherwise overwhelm central servers.

4. **Horizontal Scaling** - Adding more machines into your cluster horizontally when needed will handle increased loads better than vertical scaling (adding resources to existing ones) because it's easier to add nodes and manage them compared to trying to upgrade hardware in place which can become a bottleneck due to inter-process communication overhead.

5. **Database Sharding** - To maintain high performance with billions of users, database sharding (dividing the larger dataset into smaller partitions) ensures quicker data retrieval by distributing load across multiple databases and reducing contention points on a single large datastore which helps in avoiding slowdowns during peak times.

6. **Caching with Redis or Memcached** - Using an efficient, fast-access caching system like Redis for storing temporary data that is read often but doesn't need to be updated frequently will reduce the number of direct database calls needed and thus lower latency significantly while maintaining consistency in user sessions.

7. **Asynchronous Processing & Queues** - Implement systems where tasks such as image processing, video encoding are moved into background jobs that get processed outside of real-time interactions with users to prevent system slowdowns during peak usage times or when handling time-consuming operations like upload and moderation workloads.

8. **Rate Limiting & Throttling** - To ensure service remains responsive under abuse, rate limit requests per user/session helps maintain fair use of resources among all users while also protecting against DDoS attacks that try to overwhelm the system by flooding it with traffic. 

9. **Database Replication & Global Databases** - Using database replication strategies like master-slave or multi-master across different data centers helps in keeping a consistent, highly available and durable dataset even if one of these nodes fails while also enabling geographically distributed users to access local copies for faster performance.

10. **Auto Scaling** - Setting up auto scaling policies that automatically scale the number of servers or resources based on real-time metrics ensures efficient resource utilization without manual intervention and keeps latency low during varying loads, which is crucial when dealing with millions of users generating content concurrently.

11. **Cold Starts Mitigation** - To avoid performance hits from 'cold starts', where new instances take longer to become fully operational than warm or existing ones due to boot-up times and initialization tasks, consider keeping a pool of ready instances that can be quickly provisioned as needed using serverless computing models.

12. **Data Placement & Storage Tiering** - Using tiered storage solutions with different performance characteristics for various data types (e.g., frequently accessed content in SSDs and infrequently accessed or back-up archives on HDDs) can optimize costs while ensuring quick access to popular media files, reducing latency issues associated with retrieval from traditional all-SSD storage architectures which might be expensive for large volumes of data.

13. **Monitoring & Analytics** - Implement extensive monitoring and real-time analytics tools like Prometheus or New Relic to continuously evaluate the system performance, spot potential scaling issues early before they impact user experience significantly, allowing timely adjustments in resource allocation without service interruption for users engaging with content.

14. **Data Purging Strategies** - Regularly clear old and seldor-accessed data that aren't essential to the active feed or recent interactions while ensuring this doesn't compromise user accessibility nor archival needs, can help manage disk space usage effectively without impact on performance due to unnecessary bloat.

15. **Consistency Model** - Choosing between consistency models (like strong vs eventual) depending upon the requirements of your application while keeping in mind that different operations might benefit from slightly divergent approaches could provide a balanced trade-off when dealing with massive amounts of write and read requests without sacrificing user experience.

16. **Distributed Database Sharding** - Using sharding not just to improve performance, but also as an efficient way for Instagram's unique data management needs (like separating content based on popularity or geographical region) which can help in scaling both the database and serving users more efficiently by reducing load times across databases.

17. **Back-end API Performance Optimization** - Tweaking back-end APIs for performance such as using asynchronous requests, non-blocking IO operations, efficient parsing of data packets etc., could ensure that even when multiple concurrent content generation and retrieval processes happen simultaneously they are processed in a timely manner without service degradation.

18. **Geo-Redundancy** - Implement geographically distributed replication or multi-master database systems to enhance availability, withstand regional outages better while ensuring that localized user experiences aren't impacted by latency issues due to data residing across different physical locations and network paths.

19. **Micro Frontend Architecture** - Using microfrontends for content presentation layer rather than a single monolithic front-end app can help in scaling the UI efficiently, allowing individual components like feed rendering or video player updates not to hog resources unnecessarily while ensuring smooth user experiences even with millions of users.

20. **Content Delivery Network (CDN)** - Leverage CDNs for static content delivery globally which will reduce latency by minimizing the physical travel distance between server and end-user, also provide a buffer during peak load times or when handling heavy upload loads to central servers reducing strain on core systems.

By employing these strategies thoughtfully within an Instagram's design considerations for scalability while keeping in mind latency reduction without compromising durability ensures that the social media platform remains responsive and robust, even with billions of users generating content simultaneously across millions concurrently interacting sessions globally. These measures help mitigate potential pitfalls related to performance bottlenecks during peak load times or when dealing with vast amounts of user-generated data in real time while maintaining a seamless experience for all end-users on the platform without degradation due to infrastructure limitations.

Notification Service:
Informs users about relevant events like likes, comments, mentions, and follows.
Pushes notifications to mobile devices through platforms like Firebase Cloud Messaging or Amazon SNS.
Leverages a queueing system for asynchronous notification delivery.
Analytics Service:
Tracks user engagement, post performance, and overall platform usage.
Gathers data on views, likes, comments, shares, and clicks.
Provides insights to improve user experience, optimize content recommendations, and target advertising.
Why we need caching for storing the data?
Cache the data to handle millions of reads. It improves the user experience by making the fetching process fast. We’ll also opt for lazy loading, which minimizes the client’s waiting time.

---

Post photos and videos: The users can post photos and videos on Instagram.
Follow and unfollow users: The users can follow and unfollow other users on Instagram.
Like or dislike posts: The users can like or dislike posts of the accounts they follow.
Search photos and videos: The users can search photos and videos based on captions and location.
Generate news feed: The users can view the news feed consisting of the photos and videos (in chronological order) from all the users they follow.
2.2 Non-Functional requirements for Instagram System Design
Scalability: The system should be scalable to handle millions of users in terms of computational resources and storage.
Latency: The latency to generate a news feed should be low.
Availability: The system should be highly available.

2. Requirements for Instagram System Design
2.1 Functional Requirements for Instagram System Design
In functional Requirements, we will not discuss the login or signup page of Instagram. Login and Signup architecture is the same for everyone. We will look for further like posting photos, etc.

---

API Endpoints:

GET /posts/{post_id}: Retrieves details of a post, including the number of likes/dislikes.
POST /posts/{post_id}/like: Registers a like for the post by the authenticated user.
POST /posts/{post_id}/dislike: Registers a dislike for the post by the authenticated user.
DELETE /posts/{post_id}/like: Removes the like for the post by the authenticated user (if previously done).
DELETE /posts/{post_id}/dislike: Removes the dislike for the post by the authenticated user (if previously done).

---

These requirements has been covered:
Scalability: We can add more servers to application service layers to make the scalability better and handle numerous requests from the clients. We can also increase the number of databases to store the growing users’ data.
Latency: The use of cache and CDNs have reduced the content fetching time.
Availability: We have made the system available to the users by using the storage and databases that are replicated across the globe.
Durability: We have persistent storage that maintains the backup of the data so any uploaded content (photos and videos) never gets lost.
Consistency: We have used storage like blob stores and databases to keep our data consistent globally.

---

If the user is new, they will register firstly it will be store in database, they will verifiy the profile.
If user is already signup, they will provide the email-Id and Password.
On the home page they will get the photos and videos, as well as the story page.
The post which is posted now, it will come at the top. User can follow or unfollow the person. User can get live. It’s all depend on them.
There will be setting, in which user can see there past story or the post which has been archive. User can unblock the person they can get verified account, after paying.
5. Low-Level Design(LLD) for Instagram System Design
design-instagram-lld

Here’s a breakdown of the key components and interactions for Instagram’s low-level design:

---

Availability: The system should be highly available.
Durability: Any uploaded content (photos and videos) should never get lost.
Consistency: We can compromise a little on consistency. It is acceptable if the content (photos or videos) takes time to show in followers’ feeds located in a distant region.
Reliability: The system must be able to tolerate hardware and software failures.
3. Capacity Estimation for Instagram System Design
We have 1 billion users, with 500 million as daily active users. Assume 60 million photos and 35 million videos are shared on Instagram per day. We can consider 3 MB as the maximum size of each photo and 150 MB as the maximum size of each video uploaded on Instagram.On average, each user sends 20 requests (of any type) per day to our service.

Client checks notifications feed.
Notifications provide updates on relevant events.
Key Design Considerations:

---

API Endpoints:

GET /posts/{post_id}: Retrieves details of a post, including the number of likes/dislikes.
POST /posts/{post_id}/like: Registers a like for the post by the authenticated user.
POST /posts/{post_id}/dislike: Registers a dislike for the post by the authenticated user.

3.1 Storage Per Day
Photos: 60 million photos/day * 3 MB = 180 TeraBytes / day
Videos: 35 million videos/day * 150 MB = 5250 TB / day
Total content size = 180 + 5250 = 5430 TB
The Total Space required for a Year:
5430 TB/day * 365 (days a year) = 1981950 TB = 1981.95 PetaBytes

3.2 Bandwidth Estimation
5430 TB/(24 * 60* 60) = 5430 TB/86400 sec ~= 62.84 GB/s ~= 502.8 Gbps
Incoming bandwidth ~= 502.8 Gbps
Let’s say the ratio of readers to writers is 100:1.
Required outgoing bandwidth ~= 100 * 502.8 Gbps ~= 50.28 Tbps

Notification Service:
Informs users about relevant events like likes, comments, mentions, and follows.
Pushes notifications to mobile devices through platforms like Firebase Cloud Messaging or Amazon SNS.
Leverages a queueing system for asynchronous notification delivery.
Analytics Service:
Tracks user engagement, post performance, and overall platform usage.
Gathers data on views, likes, comments, shares, and clicks.
Provides insights to improve user experience, optimize content recommendations, and target advertising.
Why we need caching for storing the data?
Cache the data to handle millions of reads. It improves the user experience by making the fetching process fast. We’ll also opt for lazy loading, which minimizes the client’s waiting time.

Post photos and videos: The users can post photos and videos on Instagram.
Follow and unfollow users: The users can follow and unfollow other users on Instagram.
Like or dislike posts: The users can like or dislike posts of the accounts they follow.
Search photos and videos: The users can search photos and videos based on captions and location.
Generate news feed: The users can view the news feed consisting of the photos and videos (in chronological order) from all the users they follow.
2.2 Non-Functional requirements for Instagram System Design

8.5 Which Database we should select for Data storing?
It is essential to choose the right kind of database for our Instagram system, but which is the right choice — SQL or NoSQL? Our data is inherently relational, and we need an order for the data (posts should appear in chronological order) and no data loss even in case of failures (data durability). Moreover, in our case, we would benefit from relational queries like fetching the followers or images based on a user ID. Hence, SQL-based databases fulfill these requirements.

It allows us to load the content when the user scrolls and therefore save the bandwidth and focus on loading the content the user is currently viewing. It improves the latency to view or search a particular photo or video on Instagram.
6. High-Level Design(HLD) for Instagram System Design
Our system should allow us to upload, view, and search images and videos at a high level. To upload images and videos, we need to store them, and upon fetching, we need to retrieve the data from the storage. Moreover, the users should also be allowed to follow each other.

---

Post photos and videos: The users can post photos and videos on Instagram.
Follow and unfollow users: The users can follow and unfollow other users on Instagram.
Like or dislike posts: The users can like or dislike posts of the accounts they follow.
Search photos and videos: The users can search photos and videos based on captions and location.
Generate news feed: The users can view the news feed consisting of the photos and videos (in chronological order) from all the users they follow.
2.2 Non-Functional requirements for Instagram System Design
Scalability: The system should be scalable to handle millions of users in terms of computational resources and storage.
Latency: The latency to generate a news feed should be low.
Availability: The system should be highly available.

10. Scalability for Instagram System Design
Scalability refers to the ability of an organization (or a system, such as a computer network) to perform well under an increased or expanding workload. A system that scales well will be able to maintain or increase its level of performance even as it is tested by larger and larger operational demands.

We can add more servers to application service layers to make the scalability better and handle numerous requests from the clients. We can also increase the number of databases to store the growing users’ data.

Feed Generation adjusts based on changed relationships.
User monitors activity:
Client checks notifications feed.
Notifications provide updates on relevant events.
Key Design Considerations:

---

3.1 Storage Per Day
Photos: 60 million photos/day * 3 MB = 180 TeraBytes / day
Videos: 35 million videos/day * 150 MB = 5250 TB / day
Total content size = 180 + 5250 = 5430 TB
The Total Space required for a Year:
5430 TB/day * 365 (days a year) = 1981950 TB = 1981.95 PetaBytes

3.2 Bandwidth Estimation
5430 TB/(24 * 60* 60) = 5430 TB/86400 sec ~= 62.84 GB/s ~= 502.8 Gbps
Incoming bandwidth ~= 502.8 Gbps
Let’s say the ratio of readers to writers is 100:1.
Required outgoing bandwidth ~= 100 * 502.8 Gbps ~= 50.28 Tbps

3.1 Storage Per Day
Photos: 60 million photos/day * 3 MB = 180 TeraBytes / day
Videos: 35 million videos/day * 150 MB = 5250 TB / day
Total content size = 180 + 5250 = 5430 TB
The Total Space required for a Year:
5430 TB/day * 365 (days a year) = 1981950 TB = 1981.95 PetaBytes

3.2 Bandwidth Estimation
5430 TB/(24 * 60* 60) = 5430 TB/86400 sec ~= 62.84 GB/s ~= 502.8 Gbps
Incoming bandwidth ~= 502.8 Gbps
Let’s say the ratio of readers to writers is 100:1.
Required outgoing bandwidth ~= 100 * 502.8 Gbps ~= 50.28 Tbps

Use Case Diagram Instagram

In the above Diagram we have discussed about the use case diagram of Instagram:

---

Feed Generation adjusts based on changed relationships.
User monitors activity:
Client checks notifications feed.
Notifications provide updates on relevant events.
Key Design Considerations:

---

If the user is new, they will register firstly it will be store in database, they will verifiy the profile.
If user is already signup, they will provide the email-Id and Password.
On the home page they will get the photos and videos, as well as the story page.
The post which is posted now, it will come at the top. User can follow or unfollow the person. User can get live. It’s all depend on them.
There will be setting, in which user can see there past story or the post which has been archive. User can unblock the person they can get verified account, after paying.
5. Low-Level Design(LLD) for Instagram System Design
design-instagram-lld

Here’s a breakdown of the key components and interactions for Instagram’s low-level design:

---

These requirements has been covered:
Scalability: We can add more servers to application service layers to make the scalability better and handle numerous requests from the clients. We can also increase the number of databases to store the growing users’ data.
Latency: The use of cache and CDNs have reduced the content fetching time.
Availability: We have made the system available to the users by using the storage and databases that are replicated across the globe.
Durability: We have persistent storage that maintains the backup of the data so any uploaded content (photos and videos) never gets lost.
Consistency: We have used storage like blob stores and databases to keep our data consistent globally.

---

Availability: The system should be highly available.
Durability: Any uploaded content (photos and videos) should never get lost.
Consistency: We can compromise a little on consistency. It is acceptable if the content (photos or videos) takes time to show in followers’ feeds located in a distant region.
Reliability: The system must be able to tolerate hardware and software failures.
3. Capacity Estimation for Instagram System Design
We have 1 billion users, with 500 million as daily active users. Assume 60 million photos and 35 million videos are shared on Instagram per day. We can consider 3 MB as the maximum size of each photo and 150 MB as the maximum size of each video uploaded on Instagram.On average, each user sends 20 requests (of any type) per day to our service.

files = {
    'file': open(file_path, 'rb'),
    'caption': caption,

}
 
# Send the POST request
response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, files=files)
 
# Handle the response
if response.status_code == 201:
    data = response.json()
    print('Media uploaded successfully!')
    print('Media ID:', data['media_id'])
    print('URL:', data['url'])
else:
    print('Upload failed:', response.text)
    print('Error details:', response.json())  # Display any error details
7.2 Follow and unfollow users
Here’s a potential API design for following and unfollowing users on Instagram:

---

Endpoints:

POST /users/{user_id}/follow: Follows the specified user.
DELETE /users/{user_id}/follow: Unfollows the specified user.
GET /users/{user_id}/following: Retrieves a list of users followed by the specified user (paginated).
GET /users/{user_id}/followers: Retrieves a list of users following the specified user (paginated).
{
  ""message"": ""User followed successfully""
}
7.3 Like or Dislike posts
Designing an API for liking and disliking posts involves multiple considerations. Here’s a breakdown of key aspects to think about:

API Endpoints:",7.781953811645508," As far as the provided text goes, there is no explicit mention of Instagram adopting specific types of serverless cloud services in your request. However, based on industry trends and best practices for scalability with a platform like Instagram that has millions or even billions of users worldwide, it's common to utilize various serverless computing platforms such as AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, Azure Functions, etc., especially when dealing with heavy traffic loads.

Serverless architectures can efficiently handle spikes in demand without managing the underlying infrastructure since you pay only for the compute time your functions consume and they scale automatically based on usage patterns. This approach could be particularly beneficial for Instagram to ensure high availability, reliability, consistency of user-generated content (photos and videos), scalable feed generation, low latency in response times, and global distribution across multiple data centers or regions as mentioned earlier about the system design considerations like durability and consistent storage.

Instagram could implement a serverless function to process likes/dislikes on posts which are triggered by incoming requests from users (HTTP triggers). This approach would offload processing workloads away from Instagram's main servers, allowing for more efficient scaling without manual intervention during peak times and ensuring the application remains responsive under heavy load.

So while no specific mention of serverless technologies is provided in your original text about their case study on designing an API with follow/unfollow functionality, it would be a reasonable expectation that Instagram or similar platforms might utilize such services to handle scalability and reliability requirements effectively due to the high volume of daily interactions.",38.167481899261475,0,"[Document(page_content='Microservices – also known as the microservice architecture – is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of services that are:\n\nIndependently deployable\nLoosely coupled\nOrganized around business capabilities\nOwned by a small team\nThe microservice architecture enables an organization to deliver large, complex applications rapidly, frequently, reliably and sustainably – a necessity for competing and winning in today’s world.', metadata={'source': 'documentsFromText/Instagram/content.txt', 'id': 'documentsFromText/Instagram/content.txt:None:24'}), Document(page_content='Notification Service:\nInforms users about relevant events like likes, comments, mentions, and follows.\nPushes notifications to mobile devices through platforms like Firebase Cloud Messaging or Amazon SNS.\nLeverages a queueing system for asynchronous notification delivery.\nAnalytics Service:\nTracks user engagement, post performance, and overall platform usage.\nGathers data on views, likes, comments, shares, and clicks.\nProvides insights to improve user experience, optimize content recommendations, and target advertising.\nWhy we need caching for storing the data?\nCache the data to handle millions of reads.

8.5 Which Database we should select for Data storing?
It is essential to choose the right kind of database for our Instagram system, but which is the right choice — SQL or NoSQL? Our data is inherently relational, and we need an order for the data (posts should appear in chronological order) and no data loss even in case of failures (data durability). Moreover, in our case, we would benefit from relational queries like fetching the followers or images based on a user ID. Hence, SQL-based databases fulfill these requirements.

Scalability refers to the ability of an organization (or a system, such as a computer network) to perform well under an increased or expanding workload. A system that scales well will be able to maintain or increase its level of performance even as it is tested by larger and larger operational demands.

We can add more servers to application service layers to make the scalability better and handle numerous requests from the clients. We can also increase the number of databases to store the growing users’ data.

3.1 Storage Per Day
Photos: 60 million photos/day * 3 MB = 180 TeraBytes / day
Videos: 35 million videos/day * 150 MB = 5250 TB / day
Total content size = 180 + 5250 = 5430 TB
The Total Space required for a Year:
5430 TB/day * 365 (days a year) = 1981950 TB = 1981.95 PetaBytes

3.2 Bandwidth Estimation
5430 TB/(24 * 60* 60) = 5430 TB/86400 sec ~= 62.84 GB/s ~= 502.8 Gbps

Image and Feed generation service used as microservice architecture.",33.28273296356201," No, the provided text does not specifically mention anything about data compression being a requirement or strategy employed within Instagram's system design when considering network transmission for images and videos shared by users on their platform. However, it is common practice to apply some level of optimization (which can include image/video compression) before storing them in databases like Blob stores due to the massive amount of multimedia content being handled daily across platforms handling billions or even trillions of requests globally as seen with Instagram and similar social media services.

In reality, compressing data is likely an essential component for both storage efficiency and network bandwidth savings, especially given that many users are accessing the service over various internet connections including potentially limited broadband access in certain areas. This ensures smoother streaming of live videos as well by reducing latency due to smaller file sizes being transmitted across networks which helps maintain a good user experience even when they unfollow or follow someone on Instagram, where their feeds are updated accordingly with new content from others that might be stored in distant data centers.",28.917730569839478,0,"[Document(page_content='Microservices – also known as the microservice architecture – is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of services that are:\n\nIndependently deployable\nLoosely coupled\nOrganized around business capabilities\nOwned by a small team\nThe microservice architecture enables an organization to deliver large, complex applications rapidly, frequently, reliably and sustainably – a necessity for competing and winning in today’s world.', metadata={'source': 'documentsFromText/Instagram/content.txt', 'id': 'documentsFromText/Instagram/content.txt:None:24'}), Document(page_content='Notification Service:\nInforms users about relevant events like likes, comments, mentions, and follows.\nPushes notifications to mobile devices through platforms like Firebase Cloud Messaging or Amazon SNS.\nLeverages a queueing system for asynchronous notification delivery.\nAnalytics Service:\nTracks user engagement, post performance, and overall platform usage.\nGathers data on views, likes, comments, shares, and clicks.\nProvides insights to improve user experience, optimize content recommendations, and target advertising.\nWhy we need caching for storing the data?\nCache the data to handle millions of reads.

3.1 Storage Per Day
Photos: 60 million photos/day * 3 MB = 180 TeraBytes / day
Videos: 35 million videos/day * 150 MB = 5250 TB / day
Total content size = 180 + 5250 = 5430 TB
The Total Space required for a Year:
5430 TB/day * 365 (days a year) = 1981950 TB = 1981.95 PetaBytes

3.2 Bandwidth Estimation
5430 TB/(24 * 60* 60) = 5430 TB/86400 sec ~= 62.84 GB/s ~= 502.8 Gbps
Incoming bandwidth ~= 502.8 Gbps
Let’s say the ratio of readers to writers is 100:1.
Required outgoing bandwidth ~= 100 * 502.8 Gbps ~= 50.28 Tbps

5. Low-Level Design(LLD) for Instagram System Design
design-instagram-lld

Here’s a breakdown of the key components and interactions for Instagram’s low-level design:

---

These requirements has been covered:
Scalability: We can add more servers to application service layers to make the scalability better and handle numerous requests from the clients. We can also increase the number of databases to store the growing users’ data.
Latency: The use of cache and CDNs have reduced the content fetching time.
Availability: We have made the system available to the users by using the storage and databases that are replicated across the globe.
Durability: We have persistent storage that maintains the backup of the data so any uploaded content (photos and videos) never gets lost.
Consistency: We have used storage like blob stores and databases to keep our data consistent globally.

---

It allows us to load the content when the user scrolls and therefore save the bandwidth and focus on loading the content the user is currently viewing. It improves the latency to view or search a particular photo or video on Instagram.
6. High-Level Design(HLD) for Instagram System Design
Our system should allow us to upload, view, and search images and videos at a high level. To upload images and videos, we need to store them, and upon fetching, we need to retrieve the data from the storage. Moreover, the users should also be allowed to follow each other.

---

Availability: The system should be highly available.
Durability: Any uploaded content (photos and videos) should never get lost.
Consistency: We can compromise a little on consistency. It is acceptable if the content (photos or videos) takes time to show in followers’ feeds located in a distant region.
Reliability: The system must be able to tolerate hardware and software failures.
3. Capacity Estimation for Instagram System Design
We have 1 billion users, with 500 million as daily active users. Assume 60 million photos and 35 million videos are shared on Instagram per day. We can consider 3 MB as the maximum size of each photo and 150 MB as the maximum size of each video uploaded on Instagram.On average, each user sends 20 requests (of any type) per day to our service.

Scalability refers to the ability of an organization (or a system, such as a computer network) to perform well under an increased or expanding workload. A system that scales well will be able to maintain or increase its level of performance even as it is tested by larger and larger operational demands.

We can add more servers to application service layers to make the scalability better and handle numerous requests from the clients. We can also increase the number of databases to store the growing users’ data.

userId: string[Hashkey]
uploadId: string
creationDateInUtc: long[RangeKey]
}
8.5 Which Database we should select for Data storing?
It is essential to choose the right kind of database for our Instagram system, but which is the right choice — SQL or NoSQL? Our data is inherently relational, and we need an order for the data (posts should appear in chronological order) and no data loss even in case of failures (data durability). Moreover, in our case, we would benefit from relational queries like fetching the followers or images based on a user ID. Hence, SQL-based databases fulfill these requirements.

5. Low-Level Design(LLD) for Instagram System Design
design-instagram-lld

Here’s a breakdown of the key components and interactions for Instagram’s low-level design:

---

Availability: The system should be highly available.
Durability: Any uploaded content (photos and videos) should never get lost.
Consistency: We can compromise a little on consistency. It is acceptable if the content (photos or videos) takes time to show in followers’ feeds located in a distant region.
Reliability: The system must be able to tolerate hardware and software failures.
3. Capacity Estimation for Instagram System Design

else:
    print('Upload failed:', response.text)
    print('Error details:', response.json())  # Display any error details
7.2 Follow and unfollow users
Here’s a potential API design for following and unfollowing users on Instagram:

---

Endpoints:

POST /users/{user_id}/follow: Follows the specified user.
DELETE /users/{user_id}/follow: Unfollows the specified user.
GET /users/{user_id}/following: Retrieves a list of users followed by the specified user (paginated).

  ""message"": ""User followed successfully""
}
7.3 Like or Dislike posts
Designing an API for liking and disliking posts involves multiple considerations. Here’s a breakdown of key aspects to think about:

API Endpoints:",7.3771820068359375," Yes, the low-level design document (LDD) does emphasize on creating a scalable and reliable system that can handle millions of reads. It also mentions leveraging lazy loading to minimize client's waiting time when fetching data from Instagram’s database or cache layer. This approach indicates an aim towards maintaining statelessness within the core functionalities like following, unfollowing users, liking and disliking posts as these actions can be processed in isolation without needing to maintain state information on either client-side or server-side beyond what is necessary for immediate feedback (e.g., confirmation of a follow request).

However, Instagram’s actual implementation involves additional complexities related to social graph and real-time communication between the app clients and servers that require at least some form of state management on both ends. The document does not provide in detail about this aspect but it can be inferred from context as well as standard practices within such systems.

The LDD doesn't explicitly mention stateless design for these interactions, which suggests room for improvement or alternative approaches that may still align with the overall goal of scalability and reliability while reducing server load through minimizing redundant data processing (statelessness where feasible).",31.066822052001953,0,"[Document(page_content='These requirements has been covered:\nScalability: We can add more servers to application service layers to make the scalability better and handle numerous requests from the clients.

10. Scalability for Instagram System Design
Scalability refers to the ability of an organization (or a system, such as a computer network) to perform well under an increased or expanding workload. A system that scales well will be able to maintain or increase its level of performance even as it is tested by larger and larger operational demands.

We can add more servers to application service layers to make the scalability better and handle numerous requests from the clients. We can also increase the number of databases to store the growing users’ data.

Our data is inherently relational, and we need an order for the data (posts should appear in chronological order) and no data loss even in case of failures (data durability). Moreover, in our case, we would benefit from relational queries like fetching the followers or images based on a user ID. Hence, SQL-based databases fulfill these requirements.

Microservices – also known as the microservice architecture – is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of services that are:

Independently deployable
Loosely coupled
Organized around business capabilities
Owned by a small team
The microservice architecture enables an organization to deliver large, complex applications rapidly, frequently, reliably and sustainably – a necessity for competing and winning in today’s world.

API Endpoints:

GET /posts/{post_id}: Retrieves details of a post, including the number of likes/dislikes.
POST /posts/{post_id}/like: Registers a like for the post by the authenticated user.
POST /posts/{post_id}/dislike: Registers a dislike for the post by the authenticated user.
DELETE /posts/{post_id}/like: Removes the like for the post by the authenticated user (if previously done).
DELETE /posts/{post_id}/dislike: Removes the dislike for the post by the authenticated user (if previously done).

Feed Generation adjusts based on changed relationships.
User monitors activity:
Client checks notifications feed.
Notifications provide updates on relevant events.

7.3 Like or Dislike posts
Designing an API for liking and disliking posts involves multiple considerations. Here’s a breakdown of key aspects to think about:

API Endpoints:",8.692593574523926," The given context does not provide specific details on optimizing the size of AI or ML models within Instagram's system design. However, when dealing with such systems that rely heavily on user interaction and content sharing (like likes and dislikes), it is important to consider efficient ways to store and retrieve these actions due to their potential volume:

1. Data Storage Efficiency: Store like/dislike interactions efficiently by using appropriate indexing methods or storing them as meta-data related to the posts instead of separate records, if feasible within your data model design approach (e.g., relational databases with foreign keys linking likes and dislikes directly to respective post IDs).
   
2. Caching: Implement caching strategies for popular content that frequently receive interactions so as not to repeatedly read from the database or recalculate like/dislike counts, thus reducing latency (consider Redis or Memcached systems which are commonly used in large-scale social media platforms). This also helps with scalability.
   
3. Model Optimization: When it comes to AI models for personalizing user feeds based on likes and dislikes, model optimization techniques can include quantization (reducing the precision of numerical data), pruning (removing less important neurons/weights in neural networks) or knowledge distillation (transferring information from a larger model to a smaller one).
   
4. Batch Processing: Perform batch processing for updating like and dislike counts, especially if you need real-time updates without causing too much latency on the client side; this can help with both consistency in data representation across regions (as it's done server-side) as well as reducing load times after interaction.
   
5. Asynchronous Processing: If likes and dislikes are processed through AI/ML models, ensure these tasks run asynchronously to not block the main thread of user interactions on their devices or affect latency for end users; this also helps with system reliability in handling multiple concurrent requests without performance degradation.
   
6. Edge Computing: If geographic distribution is a concern (consistency across different regions), leveraging edge computing can help process data closer to the user, reducing latency and improving response times for actions like likes/dislikes that are immediate in nature but may involve some computational processing back-end side.
   
7. Database Sharding: For very high levels of activity with millions of users performing actions simultaneously (e.g., during events), database sharding can help distribute the load across multiple databases, improving overall system performance and ens012xit from potential bottlenecks associated with a single large-scaled datastore.

Consistency: We can compromise a little on consistency. It is acceptable if the content (photos or videos) takes time to show in followers’ feeds located in a distant region.
Reliability: The system must be able to tolerate hardware and software failures.
3. Capacity Estimation for Instagram System Design
We have 1 billion users, with 500 million as daily active users. Assume 60 million photos and 35 million videos are shared on Instagram per day. We can consider 3 MB as the maximum size of each photo and 150 MB as the maximum size of each video uploaded on Instagram.On average, each user sends 20 requests (of any type) per day to our service.

These requirements has been covered:
Scalability: We can add more servers to application service layers to make the scalability better and handle numerous requests from the clients. We can also increase the number of databases to store the growing users’ data.
Latency: The use of cache and CDNs have reduced the content fetching time.
Availability: We have made the system available to the users by using the storage and databases that are replicated across the globe.
Durability: We have persistent storage that maintains the backup of the data so any uploaded content (photos and videos) never gets lost.
Consistency: We have used storage like blob stores and databases to keep our data consistent globally.

7.2 Follow and unfollow users
Here’s a potential API design for following and unfollowing users on Instagram:",8.725558757781982," No, the provided information does not specifically mention using file formats such as Parquet in handling large datasets. However, it's worth considering that for very large-scale systems dealing with huge amounts of data (like Instagram), efficiency and performance are key concerns when storing and retrieving files like photos or videos. While these details were not included explicitly in the document provided:

1. **Use Case Diagram for Facebook System Design** - Similar to an UML diagram, a Use Case Diagram would visually represent interactions users have with Instagram's features such as following/unfollowing other users and commenting on posts. It helps stakehold0lders understand how the system should function from their perspective without getting into technical implementation details.

2. **Non-Functional Requirements for Facebook System Design** - Non-functional requirements, including scalability, latency, availability, durability, and reliability are essential to ensure that Instagram can handle its vast user base effectively while maintaining fast response times (latency), being always accessible when needed (availability), not losing uploaded content over time or due to failures (durability and reliability).

3. **Capacity Estimation for Facebook System Design** - It estimates the data load that Instagram might have based on daily active users, their uploads of photos/videos with assumed sizes, as well as user requests per day which can help inform resource requirements such as storage capacity (approximately 1632 TB), bandwidth to handle incoming and outgoing traffic.

4. **Use Case Diagram for Google Drive System Design** - This diagram would outline the system's capabilities in managing files, collaborations like shared folders/files among users or even external storage services integration if necessary (e.g., connecting with Dropbox API). It will show how data can be uploaded and downloaded from a cloud-based service through an interface that also enables searching for content based on various attributes such as name, size, type, etc.

5. **Non-Functional Requirements for Google Drive System Design** - Similar to Instagram's NFR but specific to GDrive which includes considerations like search and indexing performance (for finding files quickly), data security measures in place during file sharing or storage on the cloud, compatibility with multiple operating systems/environments given its use across different platforms.

6. **Capacity Estimation for Google Drive System Design** - Based on active users that utilize GDrive extensively and an estimate of uploaded files (10 GB per user), along with file sizes ranging from a few kilobytes to multiple gigabytes, the system needs ample storage space while maintaining good performance in terms of read/write speeds.

7. **Use Case Diagram for Dropbox System Design** - A UML diagram similar to Instagram's or Facebook’s but specifically designed around syncing and sharing files across devices within an organization, allowing collaborative workspaces where multiple users can access shared folders seamlessly on their respective computers without data duplication.

8. **Non-Functional Requirements for Dropbox System Design** - In addition to scalability considering the potential growth of organizations using its services and high availability (24/7), other NFRs would include security protocols during file sharing, ensuring that sensitive company documents are appropriately handled in accordance with compliance regulations.

9. **Capacity Estimation for Dropbox System Design** - For an enterprise-level solution accommodating a large number of users (10 to 25 million), estimating the total data volume becomes critical, taking into account not just file sizes but also version histories and potential archived items that may be stored over time.

Client checks notifications feed.
Notifications provide updates on relevant events.
Key Design Considerations:

---

3.1 Storage Per Day
Photos: 60 million photos/day * 3 MB = 180 TeraBytes / day
Videos: 35 million videos/day * 150 MB = 5250 TB / day
Total content size = 180 + 5250 = 5430 TB
The Total Space required for a Year:
5430 TB/day * 365 (days a year) = 1981950 TB = 1981.95 PetaBytes

3.2 Bandwidth Estimation
5430 TB/(24 * 60* 60) = 5430 TB/86400 sec ~= 62.84 GB/s ~= 502.8 Gbps

8.5 Which Database we should select for Data storing?
It is essential to choose the right kind of database for our Instagram system, but which is the right choice — SQL or NoSQL? Our data is inherently relational, and we need an order for the data (posts should appear in chronological order) and no data loss even in case of failures (data durability). Moreover, in our case, we would benefit from relational queries like fetching the followers or images based on a user ID. Hence, SQL-based databases fulfill these requirements.

8.5 Which Database we should select for Data storing?
It is essential to choose the right kind of database for our Instagram system, but which is the right choice — SQL or NoSQL? Our data is inherently relational, and we need an order for the data (posts should appear in chronological order) and no data loss even in case of failures (data durability). Moreover, in our case, we would benefit from relational queries like fetching the followers or images based on a user ID. Hence, SQL-based databases fulfill these requirements.

10. Scalability for Instagram System Design
Scalability refers to the ability of an organization (or a system, such as a computer network) to perform well under an increased or expanding workload. A system that scales well will be able to maintain or increase its level of performance even as it is tested by larger and larger operational demands.

We can add more servers to application service layers to make the scalability better and handle numerous requests from the clients. We can also increase the number of databases to store the growing users’ data.

Notification Service:
Informs users about relevant events like likes, comments, mentions, and follows.
Pushes notifications to mobile devices through platforms like Firebase Cloud Messaging or Amazon SNS.
Leverages a queueing system for asynchronous notification delivery.
Analytics Service:
Tracks user engagement, post performance, and overall platform usage.
Gathers data on views, likes, comments, shares, and clicks.
Provides insights to improve user experience, optimize content recommendations, and target advertising.
Why we need caching for storing the data?
Cache the data to handle millions of reads. It improves the user experience by making the fetching process fast. We’ll also opt for lazy loading, which minimizes the client’s waiting time.

Microservices – also known as the microservice architecture – is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of services that are:

Independently deployable
Loosely coupled
Organized around business capabilities
Owned by a small team
The microservice architecture enables an organization to deliver large, complex applications rapidly, frequently, reliably and sustainably – a necessity for competing and winning in today’s world.

2.1 Functional Requirements for Instagram System Design
In functional Requirements, we will not discuss the login or signup page of Instagram. Login and Signup architecture is the same for everyone. We will look for further like posting photos, etc.

Availability: The system should be highly available.
Durability: Any uploaded content (photos and videos) should never get lost.
Consistency: We can compromise a little on consistency. It is acceptable if the content (photos or videos) takes time to show in followers’ feeds located in a distant region.
Reliability: The system must be able to tolerate hardware and software failures.

If the user is new, they will register firstly it will be store in database, they will verifiy the profile.
If user is already signup, they will provide the email-Id and Password.
On the home page they will get the photos and videos, as well as the story page.
The post which is posted now, it will come at the top. User can follow or unfollow the person. User can get live. It’s all depend on them.
There will be setting, in which user can see there past story or the post which has been archive. User can unblock the person they can get verified account, after paying.
