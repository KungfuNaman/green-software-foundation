Is there any mention of minimizing the total number of deployed environments?,"Supply sends the request to the specific server based on the GPS location data. After that, the system draws the circle and filters out all the nearby cabs which meet the rider’s requirements.
After that, the list of the cab is sent to the ETA to calculate the distance between the rider and the cab, not geographically but by the road system.
The sorted ETA is then sent back to the supply system to offer to a driver.
If we need to handle the traffic for the newly added city then we can increase the number of servers and allocate the responsibilities of newly added cities’ cell IDs to these servers.

---

We also need to track a few more things such as the number of seats, the presence of a car seat for children, the type of vehicle, can a wheelchair be fit, and allocation ( for example, a cab may have four seats but two of those are occupied.) 
3.4 Demand Service And How it Works?
Demand service receives the request of the cab through a web socket and it tracks the GPS location of the user. It also receives different kinds of requirements such as the number of seats, type of car, or pool car.
Demand gives the location (cell ID) and user requirement to supply and make requests for the cabs. 
3.5 How Dispatch System Match the Riders to Drivers?

---

Earth has a spherical shape so it’s difficult to do summarization and approximation by using latitude and longitude. To solve this problem Uber uses the Google S2 library. This library divides the map data into tiny cells (for example 3km) and gives a unique ID to each cell. This is an easy way to spread data in the distributed system and store it easily.
S2 library gives coverage for any given shape easily. Suppose you want to figure out all the supplies available within a 3km radius of a city.
Using the S2 libraries you can draw a circle of 3km radius and it will filter out all the cells with IDs that lie in that particular circle.
This way you can easily match the rider to the driver and you can easily find out the number of cars(supply) available in a particular region.

---

ETA is calculated based on the road system (not geographically) and there are a lot of factors involved in computing the ETA (like heavy traffic or road construction).
When a rider requests a cab from a location the app not only identifies the free/idle cabs but also includes the cabs which are about to finish a ride.
It may be possible that one of the cabs which are about to finish the ride is closer to the demand than the cab which is far away from the user. So many Uber cars on the road send GPS locations every 4 seconds, so to predict traffic we can use the driver’s app’s GPS location data.

---

3.3 Supply Service And How it Works?
In our case, cabs are the supply services and they will be tracked by geolocation (latitude and longitude).
All the active cabs keep on sending the location to the server once every 4 seconds through a web application firewall and load balancer.
The accurate GPS location is sent to the data center through Kafka’s Rest APIs once it passes through the load balancer. Here we use Apache Kafka as the data hub.
Once the latest location is updated by Kafka it slowly passes through the respective worker notes’ main memory.
Also, a copy of the location (state machine/latest location of cabs) will be sent to the database and to the dispatch optimization to keep the latest location updated.

System Design of Uber App | Uber System Architecture
Last Updated : 15 Dec, 2023
Getting the hassle-free transportation service(Uber, Ola) is very easy but is it also simple to build these gigantic applications that have hundreds of software engineers working on them for a decade? surely not. These systems have much more complex architecture and there are a lot of components joined together internally to provide riding services all over the world.

It maintains consistent hashing to assign the work across the workers. It helps in sharding the application in a way that’s scalable and fault-tolerant.
Ringpop uses RPC (Remote Procedure Call) protocol to make calls from one server to another server.
Ringpop also uses a SWIM membership protocol/gossip protocol that allows independent workers to discover each other’s responsibilities. This way each server/node knows the responsibility and the work of other nodes.
Ringpop detects the newly added nodes to the cluster and the node which is removed from the cluster. It distributes the loads evenly when a node is added or removed.

When a rider requests a cab from a location the app not only identifies the free/idle cabs but also includes the cabs which are about to finish a ride.
It may be possible that one of the cabs which are about to finish the ride is closer to the demand than the cab which is far away from the user. So many Uber cars on the road send GPS locations every 4 seconds, so to predict traffic we can use the driver’s app’s GPS location data.

We also need to track a few more things such as the number of seats, the presence of a car seat for children, the type of vehicle, can a wheelchair be fit, and allocation ( for example, a cab may have four seats but two of those are occupied.) 
3.4 Demand Service And How it Works?
Demand service receives the request of the cab through a web socket and it tracks the GPS location of the user. It also receives different kinds of requirements such as the number of seats, type of car, or pool car.
Demand gives the location (cell ID) and user requirement to supply and make requests for the cabs. 
3.5 How Dispatch System Match the Riders to Drivers?

---

Supply sends the request to the specific server based on the GPS location data. After that, the system draws the circle and filters out all the nearby cabs which meet the rider’s requirements.
After that, the list of the cab is sent to the ETA to calculate the distance between the rider and the cab, not geographically but by the road system.
The sorted ETA is then sent back to the supply system to offer to a driver.
If we need to handle the traffic for the newly added city then we can increase the number of servers and allocate the responsibilities of newly added cities’ cell IDs to these servers.

---

3.3 Supply Service And How it Works?
In our case, cabs are the supply services and they will be tracked by geolocation (latitude and longitude).
All the active cabs keep on sending the location to the server once every 4 seconds through a web application firewall and load balancer.
The accurate GPS location is sent to the data center through Kafka’s Rest APIs once it passes through the load balancer. Here we use Apache Kafka as the data hub.
Once the latest location is updated by Kafka it slowly passes through the respective worker notes’ main memory.
Also, a copy of the location (state machine/latest location of cabs) will be sent to the database and to the dispatch optimization to keep the latest location updated.

Earth has a spherical shape so it’s difficult to do summarization and approximation by using latitude and longitude. To solve this problem Uber uses the Google S2 library. This library divides the map data into tiny cells (for example 3km) and gives a unique ID to each cell. This is an easy way to spread data in the distributed system and store it easily.
S2 library gives coverage for any given shape easily. Suppose you want to figure out all the supplies available within a 3km radius of a city.
Using the S2 libraries you can draw a circle of 3km radius and it will filter out all the cells with IDs that lie in that particular circle.
This way you can easily match the rider to the driver and you can easily find out the number of cars(supply) available in a particular region.

We represent the road segment distance or the traveling time through the edge weight. We also represent and model some additional factors in our graph such as one-way streets, turn costs, turn restrictions, and speed limits. 
Once the data structure is decided we can find the best route using Dijkstra’s search algorithm which is one of the best modern routing algorithms today. For faster performance, we also need to use OSRM (Open Source Routing Machine) which is based on contraction hierarchies.

When a rider requests a cab from a location the app not only identifies the free/idle cabs but also includes the cabs which are about to finish a ride.
It may be possible that one of the cabs which are about to finish the ride is closer to the demand than the cab which is far away from the user. So many Uber cars on the road send GPS locations every 4 seconds, so to predict traffic we can use the driver’s app’s GPS location data.

It maintains consistent hashing to assign the work across the workers. It helps in sharding the application in a way that’s scalable and fault-tolerant.
Ringpop uses RPC (Remote Procedure Call) protocol to make calls from one server to another server.
Ringpop also uses a SWIM membership protocol/gossip protocol that allows independent workers to discover each other’s responsibilities. This way each server/node knows the responsibility and the work of other nodes.
Ringpop detects the newly added nodes to the cluster and the node which is removed from the cluster. It distributes the loads evenly when a node is added or removed.

3.3 Supply Service And How it Works?
In our case, cabs are the supply services and they will be tracked by geolocation (latitude and longitude).
All the active cabs keep on sending the location to the server once every 4 seconds through a web application firewall and load balancer.
The accurate GPS location is sent to the data center through Kafka’s Rest APIs once it passes through the load balancer. Here we use Apache Kafka as the data hub.
Once the latest location is updated by Kafka it slowly passes through the respective worker notes’ main memory.
Also, a copy of the location (state machine/latest location of cabs) will be sent to the database and to the dispatch optimization to keep the latest location updated.

---

We also need to track a few more things such as the number of seats, the presence of a car seat for children, the type of vehicle, can a wheelchair be fit, and allocation ( for example, a cab may have four seats but two of those are occupied.) 
3.4 Demand Service And How it Works?
Demand service receives the request of the cab through a web socket and it tracks the GPS location of the user. It also receives different kinds of requirements such as the number of seats, type of car, or pool car.
Demand gives the location (cell ID) and user requirement to supply and make requests for the cabs. 
3.5 How Dispatch System Match the Riders to Drivers?

3.6 How To Scale Dispatch System?
The dispatch system (including supply, demand, and web socket) is built on NodeJS. NodeJS is the asynchronous and event-based framework that allows you to send and receive messages through WebSockets whenever you want.

Uber uses an open-source ringpop to make the application cooperative and scalable for heavy traffic. Ring pop has mainly three parts and it performs the below operation to scale the dispatch system.

System Design of Uber App | Uber System Architecture
Last Updated : 15 Dec, 2023
Getting the hassle-free transportation service(Uber, Ola) is very easy but is it also simple to build these gigantic applications that have hundreds of software engineers working on them for a decade? surely not. These systems have much more complex architecture and there are a lot of components joined together internally to provide riding services all over the world.

The database should be horizontally scalable. You can linearly add capacity by adding more servers.
It should be able to handle a lot of reads and writes because once every 4-second cabs will be sending the GPS location and that location will be updated in the database.
The system should never give downtime for any operation. It should be highly available no matter what operation you perform (expanding storage, backup, when new nodes are added, etc).
Earlier Uber was using the RDBMS PostgreSQL database but due to scalability issues uber switched to various databases. Uber uses a NoSQL database (schemaless) built on top of the MySQL database.

Earth has a spherical shape so it’s difficult to do summarization and approximation by using latitude and longitude. To solve this problem Uber uses the Google S2 library. This library divides the map data into tiny cells (for example 3km) and gives a unique ID to each cell. This is an easy way to spread data in the distributed system and store it easily.
S2 library gives coverage for any given shape easily. Suppose you want to figure out all the supplies available within a 3km radius of a city.
Using the S2 libraries you can draw a circle of 3km radius and it will filter out all the cells with IDs that lie in that particular circle.
This way you can easily match the rider to the driver and you can easily find out the number of cars(supply) available in a particular region.

Earlier Uber was built on the “monolithic” software architecture model.
They had a backend service, a frontend service, and a single database.
They used Python and its frameworks and SQLAlchemy as the ORM layer to the database.
This architecture was fine for a small number of trips in a few cities but when the service started expanding in other cities Uber team started facing the issue with the application.
After the year 2014 Uber team decided to switch to the “service-oriented architecture” and now Uber also handles food delivery and cargo.

When a rider requests a cab from a location the app not only identifies the free/idle cabs but also includes the cabs which are about to finish a ride.
It may be possible that one of the cabs which are about to finish the ride is closer to the demand than the cab which is far away from the user. So many Uber cars on the road send GPS locations every 4 seconds, so to predict traffic we can use the driver’s app’s GPS location data.

It maintains consistent hashing to assign the work across the workers. It helps in sharding the application in a way that’s scalable and fault-tolerant.
Ringpop uses RPC (Remote Procedure Call) protocol to make calls from one server to another server.
Ringpop also uses a SWIM membership protocol/gossip protocol that allows independent workers to discover each other’s responsibilities. This way each server/node knows the responsibility and the work of other nodes.
Ringpop detects the newly added nodes to the cluster and the node which is removed from the cluster. It distributes the loads evenly when a node is added or removed. 
3.7 How Does Uber Defines a Map Region?

---

Supply sends the request to the specific server based on the GPS location data. After that, the system draws the circle and filters out all the nearby cabs which meet the rider’s requirements.
After that, the list of the cab is sent to the ETA to calculate the distance between the rider and the cab, not geographically but by the road system.
The sorted ETA is then sent back to the supply system to offer to a driver.
If we need to handle the traffic for the newly added city then we can increase the number of servers and allocate the responsibilities of newly added cities’ cell IDs to these servers.

---

We also need to track a few more things such as the number of seats, the presence of a car seat for children, the type of vehicle, can a wheelchair be fit, and allocation ( for example, a cab may have four seats but two of those are occupied.) 
3.4 Demand Service And How it Works?
Demand service receives the request of the cab through a web socket and it tracks the GPS location of the user. It also receives different kinds of requirements such as the number of seats, type of car, or pool car.
Demand gives the location (cell ID) and user requirement to supply and make requests for the cabs. 
3.5 How Dispatch System Match the Riders to Drivers?

---

3.3 Supply Service And How it Works?
In our case, cabs are the supply services and they will be tracked by geolocation (latitude and longitude).
All the active cabs keep on sending the location to the server once every 4 seconds through a web application firewall and load balancer.
The accurate GPS location is sent to the data center through Kafka’s Rest APIs once it passes through the load balancer. Here we use Apache Kafka as the data hub.
Once the latest location is updated by Kafka it slowly passes through the respective worker notes’ main memory.
Also, a copy of the location (state machine/latest location of cabs) will be sent to the database and to the dispatch optimization to keep the latest location updated.

---

The database should be horizontally scalable. You can linearly add capacity by adding more servers.
It should be able to handle a lot of reads and writes because once every 4-second cabs will be sending the GPS location and that location will be updated in the database.
The system should never give downtime for any operation. It should be highly available no matter what operation you perform (expanding storage, backup, when new nodes are added, etc).
Earlier Uber was using the RDBMS PostgreSQL database but due to scalability issues uber switched to various databases. Uber uses a NoSQL database (schemaless) built on top of the MySQL database.

---

Earth has a spherical shape so it’s difficult to do summarization and approximation by using latitude and longitude. To solve this problem Uber uses the Google S2 library. This library divides the map data into tiny cells (for example 3km) and gives a unique ID to each cell. This is an easy way to spread data in the distributed system and store it easily.
S2 library gives coverage for any given shape easily. Suppose you want to figure out all the supplies available within a 3km radius of a city.
Using the S2 libraries you can draw a circle of 3km radius and it will filter out all the cells with IDs that lie in that particular circle.
This way you can easily match the rider to the driver and you can easily find out the number of cars(supply) available in a particular region.

ETA is calculated based on the road system (not geographically) and there are a lot of factors involved in computing the ETA (like heavy traffic or road construction).
When a rider requests a cab from a location the app not only identifies the free/idle cabs but also includes the cabs which are about to finish a ride.
It may be possible that one of the cabs which are about to finish the ride is closer to the demand than the cab which is far away from the user. So many Uber cars on the road send GPS locations every 4 seconds, so to predict traffic we can use the driver’s app’s GPS location data.

If we need to handle the traffic for the newly added city then we can increase the number of servers and allocate the responsibilities of newly added cities’ cell IDs to these servers.

---

We can represent the entire road network on a graph to calculate the ETAs. We can use AI-simulated algorithms or simple Dijkstra’s algorithm to find out the best route in this graph.
In that graph, nodes represent intersections (available cabs), and edges represent road segments.
We represent the road segment distance or the traveling time through the edge weight. We also represent and model some additional factors in our graph such as one-way streets, turn costs, turn restrictions, and speed limits. 
Once the data structure is decided we can find the best route using Dijkstra’s search algorithm which is one of the best modern routing algorithms today. For faster performance, we also need to use OSRM (Open Source Routing Machine) which is based on contraction hierarchies.

We also need to track a few more things such as the number of seats, the presence of a car seat for children, the type of vehicle, can a wheelchair be fit, and allocation ( for example, a cab may have four seats but two of those are occupied.)

When a rider requests a cab from a location the app not only identifies the free/idle cabs but also includes the cabs which are about to finish a ride.
It may be possible that one of the cabs which are about to finish the ride is closer to the demand than the cab which is far away from the user. So many Uber cars on the road send GPS locations every 4 seconds, so to predict traffic we can use the driver’s app’s GPS location data.

It maintains consistent hashing to assign the work across the workers. It helps in sharding the application in a way that’s scalable and fault-tolerant.
Ringpop uses RPC (Remote Procedure Call) protocol to make calls from one server to another server.
Ringpop also uses a SWIM membership protocol/gossip protocol that allows independent workers to discover each other’s responsibilities. This way each server/node knows the responsibility and the work of other nodes.
Ringpop detects the newly added nodes to the cluster and the node which is removed from the cluster. It distributes the loads evenly when a node is added or removed.

We also need to track a few more things such as the number of seats, the presence of a car seat for children, the type of vehicle, can a wheelchair be fit, and allocation ( for example, a cab may have four seats but two of those are occupied.) 
3.4 Demand Service And How it Works?
Demand service receives the request of the cab through a web socket and it tracks the GPS location of the user. It also receives different kinds of requirements such as the number of seats, type of car, or pool car.
Demand gives the location (cell ID) and user requirement to supply and make requests for the cabs. 
3.5 How Dispatch System Match the Riders to Drivers?

---

3.3 Supply Service And How it Works?
In our case, cabs are the supply services and they will be tracked by geolocation (latitude and longitude).
All the active cabs keep on sending the location to the server once every 4 seconds through a web application firewall and load balancer.
The accurate GPS location is sent to the data center through Kafka’s Rest APIs once it passes through the load balancer. Here we use Apache Kafka as the data hub.
Once the latest location is updated by Kafka it slowly passes through the respective worker notes’ main memory.
Also, a copy of the location (state machine/latest location of cabs) will be sent to the database and to the dispatch optimization to keep the latest location updated.

---

Supply sends the request to the specific server based on the GPS location data. After that, the system draws the circle and filters out all the nearby cabs which meet the rider’s requirements.
After that, the list of the cab is sent to the ETA to calculate the distance between the rider and the cab, not geographically but by the road system.
The sorted ETA is then sent back to the supply system to offer to a driver.
If we need to handle the traffic for the newly added city then we can increase the number of servers and allocate the responsibilities of newly added cities’ cell IDs to these servers.

System Design of Uber App | Uber System Architecture
Last Updated : 15 Dec, 2023
Getting the hassle-free transportation service(Uber, Ola) is very easy but is it also simple to build these gigantic applications that have hundreds of software engineers working on them for a decade? surely not. These systems have much more complex architecture and there are a lot of components joined together internally to provide riding services all over the world.

The database should be horizontally scalable. You can linearly add capacity by adding more servers.
It should be able to handle a lot of reads and writes because once every 4-second cabs will be sending the GPS location and that location will be updated in the database.
The system should never give downtime for any operation. It should be highly available no matter what operation you perform (expanding storage, backup, when new nodes are added, etc).
Earlier Uber was using the RDBMS PostgreSQL database but due to scalability issues uber switched to various databases. Uber uses a NoSQL database (schemaless) built on top of the MySQL database.

---

Earth has a spherical shape so it’s difficult to do summarization and approximation by using latitude and longitude. To solve this problem Uber uses the Google S2 library. This library divides the map data into tiny cells (for example 3km) and gives a unique ID to each cell. This is an easy way to spread data in the distributed system and store it easily.
S2 library gives coverage for any given shape easily. Suppose you want to figure out all the supplies available within a 3km radius of a city.
Using the S2 libraries you can draw a circle of 3km radius and it will filter out all the cells with IDs that lie in that particular circle.
This way you can easily match the rider to the driver and you can easily find out the number of cars(supply) available in a particular region.

How much storage we need everyday?
Let us assume each message on an average is about 500 bytes, so we’ll require about 2.32 GB of space everyday
3. Uber App Low-Level Design
We all are familiar with Uber services. A user can request a ride through the application and within a few minutes, a driver arrives nearby his/her location to take them to their destination.

System Design of Uber App | Uber System Architecture
Last Updated : 15 Dec, 2023
Getting the hassle-free transportation service(Uber, Ola) is very easy but is it also simple to build these gigantic applications that have hundreds of software engineers working on them for a decade? surely not. These systems have much more complex architecture and there are a lot of components joined together internally to provide riding services all over the world.

Working-of-Uber-App-(1)

Important Topics for the System Design of Uber App

---

1. Trace coverage
Trace coverage spot the missing road segments or incorrect road geometry.
Trace coverage calculation is based on two inputs: map data under testing and historic GPS traces of all Uber rides taken over a certain period of time.
It covers those GPS traces onto the map, comparing and matching them with road segments.
If we find missing road segments (no road is shown) on GPS traces then we take some steps to fix the deficiency. 
2. Preferred access (pick-up) point accuracy

---

3.6 How To Scale Dispatch System?
The dispatch system (including supply, demand, and web socket) is built on NodeJS. NodeJS is the asynchronous and event-based framework that allows you to send and receive messages through WebSockets whenever you want.

Uber uses an open-source ringpop to make the application cooperative and scalable for heavy traffic. Ring pop has mainly three parts and it performs the below operation to scale the dispatch system.

---

3.3 Supply Service And How it Works?
In our case, cabs are the supply services and they will be tracked by geolocation (latitude and longitude).
All the active cabs keep on sending the location to the server once every 4 seconds through a web application firewall and load balancer.
The accurate GPS location is sent to the data center through Kafka’s Rest APIs once it passes through the load balancer. Here we use Apache Kafka as the data hub.
Once the latest location is updated by Kafka it slowly passes through the respective worker notes’ main memory.
Also, a copy of the location (state machine/latest location of cabs) will be sent to the database and to the dispatch optimization to keep the latest location updated.

---

ETA is calculated based on the road system (not geographically) and there are a lot of factors involved in computing the ETA (like heavy traffic or road construction).
When a rider requests a cab from a location the app not only identifies the free/idle cabs but also includes the cabs which are about to finish a ride.
It may be possible that one of the cabs which are about to finish the ride is closer to the demand than the cab which is far away from the user. So many Uber cars on the road send GPS locations every 4 seconds, so to predict traffic we can use the driver’s app’s GPS location data.

---

The database should be horizontally scalable. You can linearly add capacity by adding more servers.
It should be able to handle a lot of reads and writes because once every 4-second cabs will be sending the GPS location and that location will be updated in the database.
The system should never give downtime for any operation. It should be highly available no matter what operation you perform (expanding storage, backup, when new nodes are added, etc).
Earlier Uber was using the RDBMS PostgreSQL database but due to scalability issues uber switched to various databases. Uber uses a NoSQL database (schemaless) built on top of the MySQL database.

---

Earth has a spherical shape so it’s difficult to do summarization and approximation by using latitude and longitude. To solve this problem Uber uses the Google S2 library. This library divides the map data into tiny cells (for example 3km) and gives a unique ID to each cell. This is an easy way to spread data in the distributed system and store it easily.
S2 library gives coverage for any given shape easily. Suppose you want to figure out all the supplies available within a 3km radius of a city.
Using the S2 libraries you can draw a circle of 3km radius and it will filter out all the cells with IDs that lie in that particular circle.
This way you can easily match the rider to the driver and you can easily find out the number of cars(supply) available in a particular region.",7.78069281578064," Response: No

It maintains consistent hashing to assign the work across the workers. It helps in sharding the application in a way that’s scalable and fault-tolerant.
Ringpop uses RPC (Remote Procedure Call) protocol to make calls from one server to another server.
Ringpop also uses a SWIM membership protocol/gossip protocol that allows independent workers to discover each other’s responsibilities. This way each server/node knows the responsibility and the work of other nodes.

Demand gives the location (cell ID) and user requirement to supply and make requests for the cabs. 
3.5 How Dispatch System Match the Riders to Drivers?

---

Supply sends the request to the specific server based on the GPS location data. After that, the system draws the circle and filters out all the nearby cabs which meet the rider’s requirements.
After that, the list of the cab is sent to the ETA to calculate the distance between the rider and the cab, not geographically but by the road system.
The sorted ETA is then sent back to the supply system to offer to a driver.
If we need to handle the traffic for the newly added city then we can increase the number of servers and allocate the responsibilities of newly added cities’ cell IDs to these servers.

Getting the hassle-free transportation service(Uber, Ola) is very easy but is it also simple to build these gigantic applications that have hundreds of software engineers working on them for a decade? surely not. These systems have much more complex architecture and there are a lot of components joined together internally to provide riding services all over the world.

The database should be horizontally scalable. You can linearly add capacity by adding more servers.
It should be able to handle a lot of reads and writes because once every 4-second cabs will be sending the GPS location and that location will be updated in the database.
The system should never give downtime for any operation. It should be highly available no matter what operation you perform (expanding storage, backup, when new nodes are added, etc).
Earlier Uber was using the RDBMS PostgreSQL database but due to scalability issues uber switched to various databases. Uber uses a NoSQL database (schemaless) built on top of the MySQL database.

Earth has a spherical shape so it’s difficult to do summarization and approximation by using latitude and longitude. To solve this problem Uber uses the Google S2 library. This library divides the map data into tiny cells (for example 3km) and gives a unique ID to each cell. This is an easy way to spread data in the distributed system and store it easily.
S2 library gives coverage for any given shape easily. Suppose you want to figure out all the supplies available within a 3km radius of a city.
Using the S2 libraries you can draw a circle of 3km radius and it will filter out all the cells with IDs that lie in that particular circle.
This way you can easily match the rider to the driver and you can easily find out the number of cars(supply) available in a particular region.

Using the S2 libraries you can draw a circle of 3km radius and it will filter out all the cells with IDs that lie in that particular circle.
This way you can easily match the rider to the driver and you can easily find out the number of cars(supply) available in a particular region.

---

Supply sends the request to the specific server based on the GPS location data. After that, the system draws the circle and filters out all the nearby cabs which meet the rider’s requirements.
After that, the list of the cab is sent to the ETA to calculate the distance between the rider and the cab, not geographically but by the road system.
The sorted ETA is then sent back to the supply system to offer to a driver.
If we need to handle the traffic for the newly added city then we can increase the number of servers and allocate the responsibilities of newly added cities’ cell IDs to these servers.

---

ETA is calculated based on the road system (not geographically) and there are a lot of factors involved in computing the ETA (like heavy traffic or road construction).
When a rider requests a cab from a location the app not only identifies the free/idle cabs but also includes the cabs which are about to finish a ride.
It may be possible that one of the cabs which are about to finish the ride is closer to the demand than the cab which is far away from the user. So many Uber cars on the road send GPS locations every 4 seconds, so to predict traffic we can use the driver’s app’s GPS location data.

---

3.3 Supply Service And How it Works?
In our case, cabs are the supply services and they will be tracked by geolocation (latitude and longitude).
All the active cabs keep on sending the location to the server once every 4 seconds through a web application firewall and load balancer.
The accurate GPS location is sent to the data center through Kafka’s Rest APIs once it passes through the load balancer. Here we use Apache Kafka as the data hub.
Once the latest location is updated by Kafka it slowly passes through the respective worker notes’ main memory.
Also, a copy of the location (state machine/latest location of cabs) will be sent to the database and to the dispatch optimization to keep the latest location updated.

---

The database should be horizontally scalable. You can linearly add capacity by adding more servers.
It should be able to handle a lot of reads and writes because once every 4-second cabs will be sending the GPS location and that location will be updated in the database.
The system should never give downtime for any operation. It should be highly available no matter what operation you perform (expanding storage, backup, when new nodes are added, etc).
Earlier Uber was using the RDBMS PostgreSQL database but due to scalability issues uber switched to various databases. Uber uses a NoSQL database (schemaless) built on top of the MySQL database.

---

We can represent the entire road network on a graph to calculate the ETAs. We can use AI-simulated algorithms or simple Dijkstra’s algorithm to find out the best route in this graph.
In that graph, nodes represent intersections (available cabs), and edges represent road segments.
We represent the road segment distance or the traveling time through the edge weight. We also represent and model some additional factors in our graph such as one-way streets, turn costs, turn restrictions, and speed limits. 
Once the data structure is decided we can find the best route using Dijkstra’s search algorithm which is one of the best modern routing algorithms today. For faster performance, we also need to use OSRM (Open Source Routing Machine) which is based on contraction hierarchies.

3.5 How Dispatch System Match the Riders to Drivers?

---

ETA is calculated based on the road system (not geographically) and there are a lot of factors involved in computing the ETA (like heavy traffic or road construction).
When a rider requests a cab from a location the app not only identifies the free/idle cabs but also includes the cabs which are about to finish a ride.
It may be possible that one of the cabs which are about to finish the ride is closer to the demand than the cab which is far away from the user. So many Uber cars on the road send GPS locations every 4 seconds, so to predict traffic we can use the driver’s app’s GPS location data.

---

Supply sends the request to the specific server based on the GPS location data. After that, the system draws the circle and filters out all the nearby cabs which meet the rider’s requirements.
After that, the list of the cab is sent to the ETA to calculate the distance between the rider and the cab, not geographically but by the road system.
The sorted ETA is then sent back to the supply system to offer to a driver.
If we need to handle the traffic for the newly added city then we can increase the number of servers and allocate the responsibilities of newly added cities’ cell IDs to these servers.

---

3.3 Supply Service And How it Works?
In our case, cabs are the supply services and they will be tracked by geolocation (latitude and longitude).
All the active cabs keep on sending the location to the server once every 4 seconds through a web application firewall and load balancer.
The accurate GPS location is sent to the data center through Kafka’s Rest APIs once it passes through the load balancer. Here we use Apache Kafka as the data hub.
Once the latest location is updated by Kafka it slowly passes through the respective worker notes’ main memory.
Also, a copy of the location (state machine/latest location of cabs) will be sent to the database and to the dispatch optimization to keep the latest location updated.

---

We can represent the entire road network on a graph to calculate the ETAs. We can use AI-simulated algorithms or simple Dijkstra’s algorithm to find out the best route in this graph.
In that graph, nodes represent intersections (available cabs), and edges represent road segments.
We represent the road segment distance or the traveling time through the edge weight. We also represent and model some additional factors in our graph such as one-way streets, turn costs, turn restrictions, and speed limits. 
Once the data structure is decided we can find the best route using Dijkstra’s search algorithm which is one of the best modern routing algorithms today. For faster performance, we also need to use OSRM (Open Source Routing Machine) which is based on contraction hierarchies.

System Design of Uber App | Uber System Architecture
Last Updated : 15 Dec, 2023
Getting the hassle-free transportation service(Uber, Ola) is very easy but is it also simple to build these gigantic applications that have hundreds of software engineers working on them for a decade? surely not. These systems have much more complex architecture and there are a lot of components joined together internally to provide riding services all over the world.

The database should be horizontally scalable. You can linearly add capacity by adding more servers.
It should be able to handle a lot of reads and writes because once every 4-second cabs will be sending the GPS location and that location will be updated in the database.
The system should never give downtime for any operation. It should be highly available no matter what operation you perform (expanding storage, backup, when new nodes are added, etc).
Earlier Uber was using the RDBMS PostgreSQL database but due to scalability issues uber switched to various databases. Uber uses a NoSQL database (schemaless) built on top of the MySQL database.

Earth has a spherical shape so it’s difficult to do summarization and approximation by using latitude and longitude. To solve this problem Uber uses the Google S2 library. This library divides the map data into tiny cells (for example 3km) and gives a unique ID to each cell. This is an easy way to spread data in the distributed system and store it easily.
S2 library gives coverage for any given shape easily. Suppose you want to figure out all the supplies available within a 3km radius of a city.
Using the S2 libraries you can draw a circle of 3km radius and it will filter out all the cells with IDs that lie in that particular circle.
This way you can easily match the rider to the driver and you can easily find out the number of cars(supply) available in a particular region.

The dispatch system (including supply, demand, and web socket) is built on NodeJS. NodeJS is the asynchronous and event-based framework that allows you to send and receive messages through WebSockets whenever you want.

Uber uses an open-source ringpop to make the application cooperative and scalable for heavy traffic. Ring pop has mainly three parts and it performs the below operation to scale the dispatch system.

It maintains consistent hashing to assign the work across the workers. It helps in sharding the application in a way that’s scalable and fault-tolerant.
Ringpop uses RPC (Remote Procedure Call) protocol to make calls from one server to another server.
Ringpop also uses a SWIM membership protocol/gossip protocol that allows independent workers to discover each other’s responsibilities. This way each server/node knows the responsibility and the work of other nodes.
Ringpop detects the newly added nodes to the cluster and the node which is removed from the cluster. It distributes the loads evenly when a node is added or removed.

The database should be horizontally scalable. You can linearly add capacity by adding more servers.
It should be able to handle a lot of reads and writes because once every 4-second cabs will be sending the GPS location and that location will be updated in the database.
The system should never give downtime for any operation. It should be highly available no matter what operation you perform (expanding storage, backup, when new nodes are added, etc).
Earlier Uber was using the RDBMS PostgreSQL database but due to scalability issues uber switched to various databases. Uber uses a NoSQL database (schemaless) built on top of the MySQL database.

Earth has a spherical shape so it’s difficult to do summarization and approximation by using latitude and longitude. To solve this problem Uber uses the Google S2 library. This library divides the map data into tiny cells (for example 3km) and gives a unique ID to each cell. This is an easy way to spread data in the distributed system and store it easily.
S2 library gives coverage for any given shape easily. Suppose you want to figure out all the supplies available within a 3km radius of a city.
Using the S2 libraries you can draw a circle of 3km radius and it will filter out all the cells with IDs that lie in that particular circle.
This way you can easily match the rider to the driver and you can easily find out the number of cars(supply) available in a particular region.

We also need to track a few more things such as the number of seats, the presence of a car seat for children, the type of vehicle, can a wheelchair be fit, and allocation ( for example, a cab may have four seats but two of those are occupied.) 
3.4 Demand Service And How it Works?
Demand service receives the request of the cab through a web socket and it tracks the GPS location of the user. It also receives different kinds of requirements such as the number of seats, type of car, or pool car.
Demand gives the location (cell ID) and user requirement to supply and make requests for the cabs. 
3.5 How Dispatch System Match the Riders to Drivers?

---

ETA is calculated based on the road system (not geographically) and there are a lot of factors involved in computing the ETA (like heavy traffic or road construction).
When a rider requests a cab from a location the app not only identifies the free/idle cabs but also includes the cabs which are about to finish a ride.
It may be possible that one of the cabs which are about to finish the ride is closer to the demand than the cab which is far away from the user. So many Uber cars on the road send GPS locations every 4 seconds, so to predict traffic we can use the driver’s app’s GPS location data.

---

3.3 Supply Service And How it Works?
In our case, cabs are the supply services and they will be tracked by geolocation (latitude and longitude).
All the active cabs keep on sending the location to the server once every 4 seconds through a web application firewall and load balancer.
The accurate GPS location is sent to the data center through Kafka’s Rest APIs once it passes through the load balancer. Here we use Apache Kafka as the data hub.
Once the latest location is updated by Kafka it slowly passes through the respective worker notes’ main memory.
Also, a copy of the location (state machine/latest location of cabs) will be sent to the database and to the dispatch optimization to keep the latest location updated.

---

Earth has a spherical shape so it’s difficult to do summarization and approximation by using latitude and longitude. To solve this problem Uber uses the Google S2 library. This library divides the map data into tiny cells (for example 3km) and gives a unique ID to each cell. This is an easy way to spread data in the distributed system and store it easily.
S2 library gives coverage for any given shape easily. Suppose you want to figure out all the supplies available within a 3km radius of a city.
Using the S2 libraries you can draw a circle of 3km radius and it will filter out all the cells with IDs that lie in that particular circle.
This way you can easily match the rider to the driver and you can easily find out the number of cars(supply) available in a particular region.

Notification Service: This service will simply send push notifications to the users. It will be discussed in detail separately.
4.4 Analytics
To optimize the system, minimize the cost of the operation and for better customer experience uber does log collection and analysis. Uber uses different tools and frameworks for analytics. For log analysis, Uber uses multiple Kafka clusters.

Earlier Uber was built on the “monolithic” software architecture model.
They had a backend service, a frontend service, and a single database.
They used Python and its frameworks and SQLAlchemy as the ORM layer to the database.
This architecture was fine for a small number of trips in a few cities but when the service started expanding in other cities Uber team started facing the issue with the application.
After the year 2014 Uber team decided to switch to the “service-oriented architecture” and now Uber also handles food delivery and cargo.

One of the main tasks of Uber service is to match the rider with cabs which means we need two different services in our architecture i.e.

3.5 How Dispatch System Match the Riders to Drivers?
We have discussed that DISCO divides the map into tiny cells with a unique ID. This ID is used as a sharding key in DISCO. When supply receives the request from demand the location gets updated using the cell ID as a shard key.
These tiny cells’ responsibilities will be divided into different servers lies in multiple regions (consistent hashing).
For example, we can allocate the responsibility of 12 tiny cells to 6 different servers (2 cells for each server) lying in 6 different regions.

Earth has a spherical shape so it’s difficult to do summarization and approximation by using latitude and longitude. To solve this problem Uber uses the Google S2 library. This library divides the map data into tiny cells (for example 3km) and gives a unique ID to each cell. This is an easy way to spread data in the distributed system and store it easily.
S2 library gives coverage for any given shape easily. Suppose you want to figure out all the supplies available within a 3km radius of a city.
Using the S2 libraries you can draw a circle of 3km radius and it will filter out all the cells with IDs that lie in that particular circle.
This way you can easily match the rider to the driver and you can easily find out the number of cars(supply) available in a particular region.

Before launching a new operation in a new area, Uber onboarded the new region to the map technology stack. In this map region, we define various subregions labeled with grades A, B, AB, and C.

---

2. Preferred access (pick-up) point accuracy
We get the pickup point in our application when we book the cab in Uber. Pick-up points are a really important metric in Uber, especially for large venues such as airports, college campuses, stadiums, factories, or companies. We calculate the distance between the actual location and all the pickup and drop-off points used by drivers.

---

Supply Service (for cabs)
Demand Service (for riders)
Uber has a Dispatch system (Dispatch optimization/DISCO) in its architecture to match supply with demand. This dispatch system uses mobile phones and it takes the responsibility to match the drivers with riders (supply to demand). 

3.2 How Dispatch System Work?
DISCO must have these goals…  

Reduce extra driving.
Minimum waiting time
Minimum overall ETA
The dispatch system completely works on maps and location data/GPS, so the first thing which is important is to model our maps and location data.

---

Supply sends the request to the specific server based on the GPS location data. After that, the system draws the circle and filters out all the nearby cabs which meet the rider’s requirements.
After that, the list of the cab is sent to the ETA to calculate the distance between the rider and the cab, not geographically but by the road system.
The sorted ETA is then sent back to the supply system to offer to a driver.
If we need to handle the traffic for the newly added city then we can increase the number of servers and allocate the responsibilities of newly added cities’ cell IDs to these servers.

Earlier Uber was built on the “monolithic” software architecture model.
They had a backend service, a frontend service, and a single database.
They used Python and its frameworks and SQLAlchemy as the ORM layer to the database.
This architecture was fine for a small number of trips in a few cities but when the service started expanding in other cities Uber team started facing the issue with the application.
After the year 2014 Uber team decided to switch to the “service-oriented architecture” and now Uber also handles food delivery and cargo.

One of the main tasks of Uber service is to match the rider with cabs which means we need two different services in our architecture i.e.

Earth has a spherical shape so it’s difficult to do summarization and approximation by using latitude and longitude. To solve this problem Uber uses the Google S2 library. This library divides the map data into tiny cells (for example 3km) and gives a unique ID to each cell. This is an easy way to spread data in the distributed system and store it easily.
S2 library gives coverage for any given shape easily. Suppose you want to figure out all the supplies available within a 3km radius of a city.
Using the S2 libraries you can draw a circle of 3km radius and it will filter out all the cells with IDs that lie in that particular circle.
This way you can easily match the rider to the driver and you can easily find out the number of cars(supply) available in a particular region.

It maintains consistent hashing to assign the work across the workers. It helps in sharding the application in a way that’s scalable and fault-tolerant.
Ringpop uses RPC (Remote Procedure Call) protocol to make calls from one server to another server.
Ringpop also uses a SWIM membership protocol/gossip protocol that allows independent workers to discover each other’s responsibilities. This way each server/node knows the responsibility and the work of other nodes.
Ringpop detects the newly added nodes to the cluster and the node which is removed from the cluster. It distributes the loads evenly when a node is added or removed.

After that, the list of the cab is sent to the ETA to calculate the distance between the rider and the cab, not geographically but by the road system.
The sorted ETA is then sent back to the supply system to offer to a driver.
If we need to handle the traffic for the newly added city then we can increase the number of servers and allocate the responsibilities of newly added cities’ cell IDs to these servers.

---

ETA is calculated based on the road system (not geographically) and there are a lot of factors involved in computing the ETA (like heavy traffic or road construction).
When a rider requests a cab from a location the app not only identifies the free/idle cabs but also includes the cabs which are about to finish a ride.
It may be possible that one of the cabs which are about to finish the ride is closer to the demand than the cab which is far away from the user. So many Uber cars on the road send GPS locations every 4 seconds, so to predict traffic we can use the driver’s app’s GPS location data.

3.3 Supply Service And How it Works?
In our case, cabs are the supply services and they will be tracked by geolocation (latitude and longitude).
All the active cabs keep on sending the location to the server once every 4 seconds through a web application firewall and load balancer.
The accurate GPS location is sent to the data center through Kafka’s Rest APIs once it passes through the load balancer. Here we use Apache Kafka as the data hub.
Once the latest location is updated by Kafka it slowly passes through the respective worker notes’ main memory.
Also, a copy of the location (state machine/latest location of cabs) will be sent to the database and to the dispatch optimization to keep the latest location updated.

---

We also need to track a few more things such as the number of seats, the presence of a car seat for children, the type of vehicle, can a wheelchair be fit, and allocation ( for example, a cab may have four seats but two of those are occupied.) 
3.4 Demand Service And How it Works?
Demand service receives the request of the cab through a web socket and it tracks the GPS location of the user. It also receives different kinds of requirements such as the number of seats, type of car, or pool car.
Demand gives the location (cell ID) and user requirement to supply and make requests for the cabs.

Getting the hassle-free transportation service(Uber, Ola) is very easy but is it also simple to build these gigantic applications that have hundreds of software engineers working on them for a decade? surely not. These systems have much more complex architecture and there are a lot of components joined together internally to provide riding services all over the world.

Redis for both caching and queuing. Some are behind Twemproxy (which provides scalability of the caching layer). Some are behind a custom clustering system.
Uber uses Schemaless (built in-house on top of MySQL), Riak, and Cassandra. Schemaless is for long-term data storage. Riak and Cassandra meet high-availability, low-latency demands.
MySQL database.
Uber is building their own distributed column store that’s orchestrating a bunch of MySQL instances.
4.3 Services
Customer Service: This service handles concerns related to customers such as customer information and authentication.
Driver Service: This service handles driver-related concerns such as authentication and driver information.
Payment Service: This service will be responsible for handling payments in our system.

The database should be horizontally scalable. You can linearly add capacity by adding more servers.
It should be able to handle a lot of reads and writes because once every 4-second cabs will be sending the GPS location and that location will be updated in the database.
The system should never give downtime for any operation. It should be highly available no matter what operation you perform (expanding storage, backup, when new nodes are added, etc).
Earlier Uber was using the RDBMS PostgreSQL database but due to scalability issues uber switched to various databases. Uber uses a NoSQL database (schemaless) built on top of the MySQL database.

Grade A: This subregion is responsible to cover the urban centers and commute areas. Around 90% of Uber traffic gets covered in this subregion, so it’s important to build the highest quality map for subregion A. 
Grade B: This subregion covers the rural and suburban areas which are less populated and less traveled by Uber customers. 
Grade AB: A union of grade A and B subregions. 
Grade C: Covers the set of highway corridors connecting various Uber Territories.

3.5 How Dispatch System Match the Riders to Drivers?
We have discussed that DISCO divides the map into tiny cells with a unique ID. This ID is used as a sharding key in DISCO. When supply receives the request from demand the location gets updated using the cell ID as a shard key.
These tiny cells’ responsibilities will be divided into different servers lies in multiple regions (consistent hashing).
For example, we can allocate the responsibility of 12 tiny cells to 6 different servers (2 cells for each server) lying in 6 different regions. 
cell distribution among nodes

The database should be horizontally scalable. You can linearly add capacity by adding more servers.
It should be able to handle a lot of reads and writes because once every 4-second cabs will be sending the GPS location and that location will be updated in the database.
The system should never give downtime for any operation. It should be highly available no matter what operation you perform (expanding storage, backup, when new nodes are added, etc).

When a rider requests a cab from a location the app not only identifies the free/idle cabs but also includes the cabs which are about to finish a ride.
It may be possible that one of the cabs which are about to finish the ride is closer to the demand than the cab which is far away from the user. So many Uber cars on the road send GPS locations every 4 seconds, so to predict traffic we can use the driver’s app’s GPS location data.

Ringpop uses RPC (Remote Procedure Call) protocol to make calls from one server to another server.
Ringpop also uses a SWIM membership protocol/gossip protocol that allows independent workers to discover each other’s responsibilities. This way each server/node knows the responsibility and the work of other nodes.
Ringpop detects the newly added nodes to the cluster and the node which is removed from the cluster. It distributes the loads evenly when a node is added or removed. 
3.7 How Does Uber Defines a Map Region?

3.3 Supply Service And How it Works?
In our case, cabs are the supply services and they will be tracked by geolocation (latitude and longitude).
All the active cabs keep on sending the location to the server once every 4 seconds through a web application firewall and load balancer.
The accurate GPS location is sent to the data center through Kafka’s Rest APIs once it passes through the load balancer. Here we use Apache Kafka as the data hub.
Once the latest location is updated by Kafka it slowly passes through the respective worker notes’ main memory.
Also, a copy of the location (state machine/latest location of cabs) will be sent to the database and to the dispatch optimization to keep the latest location updated.

---

We also need to track a few more things such as the number of seats, the presence of a car seat for children, the type of vehicle, can a wheelchair be fit, and allocation ( for example, a cab may have four seats but two of those are occupied.) 
3.4 Demand Service And How it Works?
Demand service receives the request of the cab through a web socket and it tracks the GPS location of the user. It also receives different kinds of requirements such as the number of seats, type of car, or pool car.
Demand gives the location (cell ID) and user requirement to supply and make requests for the cabs. 
3.5 How Dispatch System Match the Riders to Drivers?

---

Supply sends the request to the specific server based on the GPS location data. After that, the system draws the circle and filters out all the nearby cabs which meet the rider’s requirements.
After that, the list of the cab is sent to the ETA to calculate the distance between the rider and the cab, not geographically but by the road system.
The sorted ETA is then sent back to the supply system to offer to a driver.
If we need to handle the traffic for the newly added city then we can increase the number of servers and allocate the responsibilities of newly added cities’ cell IDs to these servers.

It may be possible that one of the cabs which are about to finish the ride is closer to the demand than the cab which is far away from the user. So many Uber cars on the road send GPS locations every 4 seconds, so to predict traffic we can use the driver’s app’s GPS location data.

---

Supply sends the request to the specific server based on the GPS location data. After that, the system draws the circle and filters out all the nearby cabs which meet the rider’s requirements.
After that, the list of the cab is sent to the ETA to calculate the distance between the rider and the cab, not geographically but by the road system.
The sorted ETA is then sent back to the supply system to offer to a driver.
If we need to handle the traffic for the newly added city then we can increase the number of servers and allocate the responsibilities of newly added cities’ cell IDs to these servers.

---

Grade A: This subregion is responsible to cover the urban centers and commute areas. Around 90% of Uber traffic gets covered in this subregion, so it’s important to build the highest quality map for subregion A. 
Grade B: This subregion covers the rural and suburban areas which are less populated and less traveled by Uber customers. 
Grade AB: A union of grade A and B subregions. 
Grade C: Covers the set of highway corridors connecting various Uber Territories.  
3.8 How Does Uber Build the Map?
Uber uses a third-party map service provider to build the map in their application. Earlier Uber was using Mapbox services but later Uber switched to Google Maps API to track the location and calculate ETAs.

---

We also need to track a few more things such as the number of seats, the presence of a car seat for children, the type of vehicle, can a wheelchair be fit, and allocation ( for example, a cab may have four seats but two of those are occupied.) 
3.4 Demand Service And How it Works?
Demand service receives the request of the cab through a web socket and it tracks the GPS location of the user. It also receives different kinds of requirements such as the number of seats, type of car, or pool car.
Demand gives the location (cell ID) and user requirement to supply and make requests for the cabs. 
3.5 How Dispatch System Match the Riders to Drivers?

---

How many requests per second our system need to handle?
5 million requests daily would make approx 58/requests per second
How much storage we need everyday?
Let us assume each message on an average is about 500 bytes, so we’ll require about 2.32 GB of space everyday
3. Uber App Low-Level Design
We all are familiar with Uber services. A user can request a ride through the application and within a few minutes, a driver arrives nearby his/her location to take them to their destination.

System Design of Uber App | Uber System Architecture
Last Updated : 15 Dec, 2023
Getting the hassle-free transportation service(Uber, Ola) is very easy but is it also simple to build these gigantic applications that have hundreds of software engineers working on them for a decade? surely not. These systems have much more complex architecture and there are a lot of components joined together internally to provide riding services all over the world.

Earth has a spherical shape so it’s difficult to do summarization and approximation by using latitude and longitude. To solve this problem Uber uses the Google S2 library. This library divides the map data into tiny cells (for example 3km) and gives a unique ID to each cell. This is an easy way to spread data in the distributed system and store it easily.
S2 library gives coverage for any given shape easily. Suppose you want to figure out all the supplies available within a 3km radius of a city.
Using the S2 libraries you can draw a circle of 3km radius and it will filter out all the cells with IDs that lie in that particular circle.
This way you can easily match the rider to the driver and you can easily find out the number of cars(supply) available in a particular region.

It maintains consistent hashing to assign the work across the workers. It helps in sharding the application in a way that’s scalable and fault-tolerant.
Ringpop uses RPC (Remote Procedure Call) protocol to make calls from one server to another server.
Ringpop also uses a SWIM membership protocol/gossip protocol that allows independent workers to discover each other’s responsibilities. This way each server/node knows the responsibility and the work of other nodes.
Ringpop detects the newly added nodes to the cluster and the node which is removed from the cluster. It distributes the loads evenly when a node is added or removed. 
3.7 How Does Uber Defines a Map Region?

---

We can represent the entire road network on a graph to calculate the ETAs. We can use AI-simulated algorithms or simple Dijkstra’s algorithm to find out the best route in this graph.
In that graph, nodes represent intersections (available cabs), and edges represent road segments.
We represent the road segment distance or the traveling time through the edge weight. We also represent and model some additional factors in our graph such as one-way streets, turn costs, turn restrictions, and speed limits. 
Once the data structure is decided we can find the best route using Dijkstra’s search algorithm which is one of the best modern routing algorithms today. For faster performance, we also need to use OSRM (Open Source Routing Machine) which is based on contraction hierarchies.

Redis for both caching and queuing. Some are behind Twemproxy (which provides scalability of the caching layer). Some are behind a custom clustering system.
Uber uses Schemaless (built in-house on top of MySQL), Riak, and Cassandra. Schemaless is for long-term data storage. Riak and Cassandra meet high-availability, low-latency demands.
MySQL database.
Uber is building their own distributed column store that’s orchestrating a bunch of MySQL instances.

Customer Service: This service handles concerns related to customers such as customer information and authentication.
Driver Service: This service handles driver-related concerns such as authentication and driver information.
Payment Service: This service will be responsible for handling payments in our system.

Lets assume we have 5 million active users on our application with 200,000 drivers and on an average there are 1 million rides daily. If a user performs 5 actions on an average then we need to handle 5 million requests daily",7.649335145950317," The provided document outlines the system design for Uber's application, touching upon various components and services integral to its functioning. While it does not directly discuss aspects such as schema-less databases or S2 libraries within a singular section focusing on these technologies, we can infer their relevance based on industry practices and general technical architecture of scalable applications like Uber's system mentioned in the document provided:

1. Redis for both caching and queuing - Given its role as an essential component of data flow management within Uber’s infrastructure, it is likely that a schema-less database may be used to support similar use cases due to their shared traits such as horizontal scalability and performance under high loads with large volumes of read/write operations.

2. Schemaless databases - Considering the system's need for flexible data management without predefined schemas, it would benefit from a schema-less database like Riak or Cassandra that are mentioned in Uber’s tech stack to efficiently handle such requirements and also serve their high availability needs with low latency.

3. Google S2 Library - To address the earth's spherical shape issue for geospatial calculations, it is plausible that a schema-less approach would be beneficial as well since these systems often need to perform complex spatial operations and store vast amounts of unstructured data such as GPS coordinates across distributed datasets.

As far as static caching goes in the context mentioned: While not explicitly stated regarding caching for static content, it is commonplace within large-scale applications that utilize databases like MySQL or NoSQL solutions to implement some form of temporary cache (like Memcached) on top of Redis to handle frequently accessed data while keeping sensitive operations securely processed by a primary database. This often includes user sessions and other transient application state, which might not necessarily be in the document you provided but is essential for modern distributed applications like Uber’s system architecture.

To address this requirement more directly: The caching of static content or data within an app serving millions can greatly benefit from implementing a schema-less approach where appropriate due to its inherent flexibility and performance benefits, which are crucial in systems demanding low latency across distributed services like Uber’s application. This would ensure that commonly accessed information remains readily available while reducing the load on databases through intelligently designed caching strategies—possibly using Redis for quick accesses or Memcached as part of Twemproxy setup if needed to scale horizontally and maintain high performance during peak usage times, such as rush hour in a major city.

Given that Uber uses various backend databases like MySQL (with custom distributed column stores), Riak, Cassandra for different purposes—some are read/write intensive while others demand more resilience against data loss and quicker access to write-heavy datasets—a schema-less system would offer the necessary flexibility across these diverse needs.

In summary, although not specifically mentioned in your document snippet about Uber's architecture as it pertains to caching static content or using a Schemaless database directly for GPS coordinates storage and S2 library utilization within Google’s infrastructure (as opposed to building their own system), these components are inherently connected by the principles of scalability, availability, low latency, which Uber's complex systems demand. As such, while your document does not discuss static data caching directly or explicitly state a schema-less approach for GPS and coordinates management using S2 library within Google infrastructure, it is reasonable to infer their use in parallel with the stated technologies based on industry practices related to scalability and performance optimization that are part of Uber's system design.",74.35925340652466,0,"[Document(page_content='Supply sends the request to the specific server based on the GPS location data.

ETA is calculated based on the road system (not geographically) and there are a lot of factors involved in computing the ETA (like heavy traffic or road construction).
When a rider requests a cab from a location the app not only identifies the free/idle cabs but also includes the cabs which are about to finish a ride.
It may be possible that one of the cabs which are about to finish the ride is closer to the demand than the cab which is far away from the user. So many Uber cars on the road send GPS locations every 4 seconds, so to predict traffic we can use the driver’s app’s GPS location data.

---

Supply sends the request to the specific server based on the GPS location data. After that, the system draws the circle and filters out all the nearby cabs which meet the rider’s requirements.
After that, the list of the cab is sent to the ETA to calculate the distance between the rider and the cab, not geographically but by the road system.
The sorted ETA is then sent back to the supply system to offer to a driver.
If we need to handle the traffic for the newly added city then we can increase the number of servers and allocate the responsibilities of newly added cities’ cell IDs to these servers.

Grade A: This subregion is responsible to cover the urban centers and commute areas. Around 90% of Uber traffic gets covered in this subregion, so it’s important to build the highest quality map for subregion A. 
Grade B: This subregion covers the rural and suburban areas which are less populated and less traveled by Uber customers. 
Grade AB: A union of grade A and B subregions. 
Grade C: Covers the set of highway corridors connecting various Uber Territories.  
3.8 How Does Uber Build the Map?
Uber uses a third-party map service provider to build the map in their application. Earlier Uber was using Mapbox services but later Uber switched to Google Maps API to track the location and calculate ETAs.

---

We can represent the entire road network on a graph to calculate the ETAs. We can use AI-simulated algorithms or simple Dijkstra’s algorithm to find out the best route in this graph.
In that graph, nodes represent intersections (available cabs), and edges represent road segments.
We represent the road segment distance or the traveling time through the edge weight. We also represent and model some additional factors in our graph such as one-way streets, turn costs, turn restrictions, and speed limits. 
Once the data structure is decided we can find the best route using Dijkstra’s search algorithm which is one of the best modern routing algorithms today. For faster performance, we also need to use OSRM (Open Source Routing Machine) which is based on contraction hierarchies.

Earth has a spherical shape so it’s difficult to do summarization and approximation by using latitude and longitude. To solve this problem Uber uses the Google S2 library. This library divides the map data into tiny cells (for example 3km) and gives a unique ID to each cell. This is an easy way to spread data in the distributed system and store it easily.
S2 library gives coverage for any given shape easily. Suppose you want to figure out all the supplies available within a 3km radius of a city.
Using the S2 libraries you can draw a circle of 3km radius and it will filter out all the cells with IDs that lie in that particular circle.
This way you can easily match the rider to the driver and you can easily find out the number of cars(supply) available in a particular region.

It maintains consistent hashing to assign the work across the workers. It helps in sharding the application in a way that’s scalable and fault-tolerant.
Ringpop uses RPC (Remote Procedure Call) protocol to make calls from one server to another server.
Ringpop also uses a SWIM membership protocol/gossip protocol that allows independent workers to discover each other’s responsibilities. This way each server/node knows the responsibility and the work of other nodes.
Ringpop detects the newly added nodes to the cluster and the node which is removed from the cluster. It distributes the loads evenly when a node is added or removed.

We also need to track a few more things such as the number of seats, the presence of a car seat for children, the type of vehicle, can a wheelchair be fit, and allocation ( for example, a cab may have four seats but two of those are occupied.) 
3.4 Demand Service And How it Works?
Demand service receives the request of the cab through a web socket and it tracks the GPS location of the user. It also receives different kinds of requirements such as the number of seats, type of car, or pool car.
Demand gives the location (cell ID) and user requirement to supply and make requests for the cabs.

---

3.3 Supply Service And How it Works?
In our case, cabs are the supply services and they will be tracked by geolocation (latitude and longitude).
All the active cabs keep on sending the location to the server once every 4 seconds through a web application firewall and load balancer.
The accurate GPS location is sent to the data center through Kafka’s Rest APIs once it passes through the load balancer. Here we use Apache Kafka as the data hub.
Once the latest location is updated by Kafka it slowly passes through the respective worker notes’ main memory.
Also, a copy of the location (state machine/latest location of cabs) will be sent to the database and to the dispatch optimization to keep the latest location updated.

1. Trace coverage
Trace coverage spot the missing road segments or incorrect road geometry.
Trace coverage calculation is based on two inputs: map data under testing and historic GPS traces of all Uber rides taken over a certain period of time.
It covers those GPS traces onto the map, comparing and matching them with road segments.
If we find missing road segments (no road is shown) on GPS traces then we take some steps to fix the deficiency.

It may be possible that one of the cabs which are about to finish the ride is closer to the demand than the cab which is far away from the user. So many Uber cars on the road send GPS locations every 4 seconds, so to predict traffic we can use the driver’s app’s GPS location data.

System Design of Uber App | Uber System Architecture
Last Updated : 15 Dec, 2023
Getting the hassle-free transportation service(Uber, Ola) is very easy but is it also simple to build these gigantic applications that have hundreds of software engineers working on them for a decade? surely not. These systems have much more complex architecture and there are a lot of components joined together internally to provide riding services all over the world.

The database should be horizontally scalable. You can linearly add capacity by adding more servers.
It should be able to handle a lot of reads and writes because once every 4-second cabs will be sending the GPS location and that location will be updated in the database.
The system should never give downtime for any operation. It should be highly available no matter what operation you perform (expanding storage, backup, when new nodes are added, etc).
Earlier Uber was using the RDBMS PostgreSQL database but due to scalability issues uber switched to various databases. Uber uses a NoSQL database (schemaless) built on top of the MySQL database.

Earth has a spherical shape so it’s difficult to do summarization and approximation by using latitude and longitude. To solve this problem Uber uses the Google S2 library. This library divides the map data into tiny cells (for example 3km) and gives a unique ID to each cell. This is an easy way to spread data in the distributed system and store it easily.
S2 library gives coverage for any given shape easily. Suppose you want to figure out all the supplies available within a 3km radius of a city.
Using the S2 libraries you can draw a circle of 3km radius and it will filter out all the cells with IDs that lie in that particular circle.
This way you can easily match the rider to the driver and you can easily find out the number of cars(supply) available in a particular region.

ETA is calculated based on the road system (not geographically) and there are a lot of factors involved in computing the ETA (like heavy traffic or road construction).
When a rider requests a cab from a location the app not only identifies the free/idle cabs but also includes the cabs which are about to finish a ride.
It may be possible that one of the cabs which are about to finish the ride is closer to the demand than the cab which is far away from the user. So many Uber cars on the road send GPS locations every 4 seconds, so to predict traffic we can use the driver’s app’s GPS location data.

Demand gives the location (cell ID) and user requirement to supply and make requests for the cabs. 
3.5 How Dispatch System Match the Riders to Drivers?

3.3 Supply Service And How it Works?
In our case, cabs are the supply services and they will be tracked by geolocation (latitude and longitude).
All the active cabs keep on sending the location to the server once every 4 seconds through a web application firewall and load balancer.
The accurate GPS location is sent to the data center through Kafka’s Rest APIs once it passes through the load balancer. Here we use Apache Kafka as the data hub.
Once the latest location is updated by Kafka it slowly passes through the respective worker notes’ main memory.
Also, a copy of the location (state machine/latest location of cabs) will be sent to the database and to the dispatch optimization to keep the latest location updated.

---

3.6 How To Scale Dispatch System?
The dispatch system (including supply, demand, and web socket) is built on NodeJS. NodeJS is the asynchronous and event-based framework that allows you to send and receive messages through WebSockets whenever you want.

Uber uses an open-source ringpop to make the application cooperative and scalable for heavy traffic. Ring pop has mainly three parts and it performs the below operation to scale the dispatch system.

Notification Service: This service will simply send push notifications to the users. It will be discussed in detail separately.

Kafka takes historical data along with real-time data. Data is archived into Hadoop before it expires from Kafka. The data is also indexed into an Elastic search stack for searching and visualizations. Elastic search does some log analysis using Kibana/Graphana. Some of the analyses performed by Uber using different tools and frameworks are…

We can represent the entire road network on a graph to calculate the ETAs. We can use AI-simulated algorithms or simple Dijkstra’s algorithm to find out the best route in this graph.
In that graph, nodes represent intersections (available cabs), and edges represent road segments.
We represent the road segment distance or the traveling time through the edge weight. We also represent and model some additional factors in our graph such as one-way streets, turn costs, turn restrictions, and speed limits. 
Once the data structure is decided we can find the best route using Dijkstra’s search algorithm which is one of the best modern routing algorithms today. For faster performance, we also need to use OSRM (Open Source Routing Machine) which is based on contraction hierarchies.

The focus seems to be more on software development aspects like scalability, load balancing, data management using various databases (NoSQL over PostgreSQL), analytics for system optimization with Kafka and Elastic search stacks etc., rather than explicitly discussing cloud-native network security tools or controls implementation strategies in the Uber's software architecture.",Not Applicable,Not Applicable
Is there any mention of using DDoS protection?,"ETA is calculated based on the road system (not geographically) and there are a lot of factors involved in computing the ETA (like heavy traffic or road construction).
When a rider requests a cab from a location the app not only identifies the free/idle cabs but also includes the cabs which are about to finish a ride.
It may be possible that one of the cabs which are about to finish the ride is closer to the demand than the cab which is far away from the user. So many Uber cars on the road send GPS locations every 4 seconds, so to predict traffic we can use the driver’s app’s GPS location data.

---

Supply sends the request to the specific server based on the GPS location data. After that, the system draws the circle and filters out all the nearby cabs which meet the rider’s requirements.
After that, the list of the cab is sent to the ETA to calculate the distance between the rider and the cab, not geographically but by the road system.
The sorted ETA is then sent back to the supply system to offer to a driver.
If we need to handle the traffic for the newly added city then we can increase the number of servers and allocate the responsibilities of newly added cities’ cell IDs to these servers.

Grade A: This subregion is responsible to cover the urban centers and commute areas. Around 90% of Uber traffic gets covered in this subregion, so it’s important to build the highest quality map for subregion A. 
Grade B: This subregion covers the rural and suburban areas which are less populated and less traveled by Uber customers. 
Grade AB: A union of grade A and B subregions. 
Grade C: Covers the set of highway corridors connecting various Uber Territories.  
3.8 How Does Uber Build the Map?
Uber uses a third-party map service provider to build the map in their application. Earlier Uber was using Mapbox services but later Uber switched to Google Maps API to track the location and calculate ETAs.

---

We also need to track a few more things such as the number of seats, the presence of a car seat for children, the type of vehicle, can a wheelchair be fit, and allocation ( for example, a cab may have four seats but two of those are occupied.) 
3.4 Demand Service And How it Works?
Demand service receives the request of the cab through a web socket and it tracks the GPS location of the user. It also receives different kinds of requirements such as the number of seats, type of car, or pool car.
Demand gives the location (cell ID) and user requirement to supply and make requests for the cabs. 
3.5 How Dispatch System Match the Riders to Drivers?

---

It maintains consistent hashing to assign the work across the workers. It helps in sharding the application in a way that’s scalable and fault-tolerant.
Ringpop uses RPC (Remote Procedure Call) protocol to make calls from one server to another server.
Ringpop also uses a SWIM membership protocol/gossip protocol that allows independent workers to discover each other’s responsibilities. This way each server/node knows the responsibility and the work of other nodes.
Ringpop detects the newly added nodes to the cluster and the node which is removed from the cluster. It distributes the loads evenly when a node is added or removed. 
3.7 How Does Uber Defines a Map Region?

---

The database should be horizontally scalable. You can linearly add capacity by adding more servers.
It should be able to handle a lot of reads and writes because once every 4-second cabs will be sending the GPS location and that location will be updated in the database.
The system should never give downtime for any operation. It should be highly available no matter what operation you perform (expanding storage, backup, when new nodes are added, etc).
Earlier Uber was using the RDBMS PostgreSQL database but due to scalability issues uber switched to various databases. Uber uses a NoSQL database (schemaless) built on top of the MySQL database.

Earth has a spherical shape so it’s difficult to do summarization and approximation by using latitude and longitude. To solve this problem Uber uses the Google S2 library. This library divides the map data into tiny cells (for example 3km) and gives a unique ID to each cell. This is an easy way to spread data in the distributed system and store it easily.
S2 library gives coverage for any given shape easily. Suppose you want to figure out all the supplies available within a 3km radius of a city.
Using the S2 libraries you can draw a circle of 3km radius and it will filter out all the cells with IDs that lie in that particular circle.
This way you can easily match the rider to the driver and you can easily find out the number of cars(supply) available in a particular region.

4.5 How To Handle The Data center Failure?
Datacenter failure doesn’t happen very often but Uber still maintains a backup data center to run the trip smoothly. This data center includes all the components but Uber never copies the existing data into the backup data center. 

Then how does Uber tackle the data center failure??

---

3.3 Supply Service And How it Works?
In our case, cabs are the supply services and they will be tracked by geolocation (latitude and longitude).
All the active cabs keep on sending the location to the server once every 4 seconds through a web application firewall and load balancer.
The accurate GPS location is sent to the data center through Kafka’s Rest APIs once it passes through the load balancer. Here we use Apache Kafka as the data hub.
Once the latest location is updated by Kafka it slowly passes through the respective worker notes’ main memory.
Also, a copy of the location (state machine/latest location of cabs) will be sent to the database and to the dispatch optimization to keep the latest location updated.

---

The database should be horizontally scalable. You can linearly add capacity by adding more servers.
It should be able to handle a lot of reads and writes because once every 4-second cabs will be sending the GPS location and that location will be updated in the database.

When a rider requests a cab from a location the app not only identifies the free/idle cabs but also includes the cabs which are about to finish a ride.
It may be possible that one of the cabs which are about to finish the ride is closer to the demand than the cab which is far away from the user. So many Uber cars on the road send GPS locations every 4 seconds, so to predict traffic we can use the driver’s app’s GPS location data.

We also need to track a few more things such as the number of seats, the presence of a car seat for children, the type of vehicle, can a wheelchair be fit, and allocation ( for example, a cab may have four seats but two of those are occupied.) 
3.4 Demand Service And How it Works?
Demand service receives the request of the cab through a web socket and it tracks the GPS location of the user. It also receives different kinds of requirements such as the number of seats, type of car, or pool car.
Demand gives the location (cell ID) and user requirement to supply and make requests for the cabs.

Ringpop also uses a SWIM membership protocol/gossip protocol that allows independent workers to discover each other’s responsibilities. This way each server/node knows the responsibility and the work of other nodes.
Ringpop detects the newly added nodes to the cluster and the node which is removed from the cluster. It distributes the loads evenly when a node is added or removed. 
3.7 How Does Uber Defines a Map Region?

---

Supply sends the request to the specific server based on the GPS location data. After that, the system draws the circle and filters out all the nearby cabs which meet the rider’s requirements.
After that, the list of the cab is sent to the ETA to calculate the distance between the rider and the cab, not geographically but by the road system.
The sorted ETA is then sent back to the supply system to offer to a driver.
If we need to handle the traffic for the newly added city then we can increase the number of servers and allocate the responsibilities of newly added cities’ cell IDs to these servers.

---

3.3 Supply Service And How it Works?
In our case, cabs are the supply services and they will be tracked by geolocation (latitude and longitude).
All the active cabs keep on sending the location to the server once every 4 seconds through a web application firewall and load balancer.
The accurate GPS location is sent to the data center through Kafka’s Rest APIs once it passes through the load balancer. Here we use Apache Kafka as the data hub.
Once the latest location is updated by Kafka it slowly passes through the respective worker notes’ main memory.
Also, a copy of the location (state machine/latest location of cabs) will be sent to the database and to the dispatch optimization to keep the latest location updated.

1. Trace coverage
Trace coverage spot the missing road segments or incorrect road geometry.
Trace coverage calculation is based on two inputs: map data under testing and historic GPS traces of all Uber rides taken over a certain period of time.
It covers those GPS traces onto the map, comparing and matching them with road segments.
If we find missing road segments (no road is shown) on GPS traces then we take some steps to fix the deficiency. 
2. Preferred access (pick-up) point accuracy

The database should be horizontally scalable. You can linearly add capacity by adding more servers.
It should be able to handle a lot of reads and writes because once every 4-second cabs will be sending the GPS location and that location will be updated in the database.
The system should never give downtime for any operation. It should be highly available no matter what operation you perform (expanding storage, backup, when new nodes are added, etc).
Earlier Uber was using the RDBMS PostgreSQL database but due to scalability issues uber switched to various databases. Uber uses a NoSQL database (schemaless) built on top of the MySQL database.

Earth has a spherical shape so it’s difficult to do summarization and approximation by using latitude and longitude. To solve this problem Uber uses the Google S2 library. This library divides the map data into tiny cells (for example 3km) and gives a unique ID to each cell. This is an easy way to spread data in the distributed system and store it easily.
S2 library gives coverage for any given shape easily. Suppose you want to figure out all the supplies available within a 3km radius of a city.
Using the S2 libraries you can draw a circle of 3km radius and it will filter out all the cells with IDs that lie in that particular circle.
This way you can easily match the rider to the driver and you can easily find out the number of cars(supply) available in a particular region.

Earlier Uber was built on the “monolithic” software architecture model.
They had a backend service, a frontend service, and a single database.
They used Python and its frameworks and SQLAlchemy as the ORM layer to the database.
This architecture was fine for a small number of trips in a few cities but when the service started expanding in other cities Uber team started facing the issue with the application.
After the year 2014 Uber team decided to switch to the “service-oriented architecture” and now Uber also handles food delivery and cargo.

When a rider requests a cab from a location the app not only identifies the free/idle cabs but also includes the cabs which are about to finish a ride.
It may be possible that one of the cabs which are about to finish the ride is closer to the demand than the cab which is far away from the user. So many Uber cars on the road send GPS locations every 4 seconds, so to predict traffic we can use the driver’s app’s GPS location data.

It maintains consistent hashing to assign the work across the workers. It helps in sharding the application in a way that’s scalable and fault-tolerant.
Ringpop uses RPC (Remote Procedure Call) protocol to make calls from one server to another server.
Ringpop also uses a SWIM membership protocol/gossip protocol that allows independent workers to discover each other’s responsibilities. This way each server/node knows the responsibility and the work of other nodes.
Ringpop detects the newly added nodes to the cluster and the node which is removed from the cluster. It distributes the loads evenly when a node is added or removed. 
3.7 How Does Uber Defines a Map Region?

3.3 Supply Service And How it Works?
In our case, cabs are the supply services and they will be tracked by geolocation (latitude and longitude).
All the active cabs keep on sending the location to the server once every 4 seconds through a web application firewall and load balancer.
The accurate GPS location is sent to the data center through Kafka’s Rest APIs once it passes through the load balancer. Here we use Apache Kafka as the data hub.
Once the latest location is updated by Kafka it slowly passes through the respective worker notes’ main memory.
Also, a copy of the location (state machine/latest location of cabs) will be sent to the database and to the dispatch optimization to keep the latest location updated.

---

We also need to track a few more things such as the number of seats, the presence of a car seat for children, the type of vehicle, can a wheelchair be fit, and allocation ( for example, a cab may have four seats but two of those are occupied.) 
3.4 Demand Service And How it Works?
Demand service receives the request of the cab through a web socket and it tracks the GPS location of the user. It also receives different kinds of requirements such as the number of seats, type of car, or pool car.
Demand gives the location (cell ID) and user requirement to supply and make requests for the cabs. 
3.5 How Dispatch System Match the Riders to Drivers?

---

Supply sends the request to the specific server based on the GPS location data. After that, the system draws the circle and filters out all the nearby cabs which meet the rider’s requirements.
After that, the list of the cab is sent to the ETA to calculate the distance between the rider and the cab, not geographically but by the road system.
The sorted ETA is then sent back to the supply system to offer to a driver.
If we need to handle the traffic for the newly added city then we can increase the number of servers and allocate the responsibilities of newly added cities’ cell IDs to these servers.

System Design of Uber App | Uber System Architecture
Last Updated : 15 Dec, 2023
Getting the hassle-free transportation service(Uber, Ola) is very easy but is it also simple to build these gigantic applications that have hundreds of software engineers working on them for a decade? surely not. These systems have much more complex architecture and there are a lot of components joined together internally to provide riding services all over the world.

The database should be horizontally scalable. You can linearly add capacity by adding more servers.
It should be able to handle a lot of reads and writes because once every 4-second cabs will be sending the GPS location and that location will be updated in the database.
The system should never give downtime for any operation. It should be highly available no matter what operation you perform (expanding storage, backup, when new nodes are added, etc).
Earlier Uber was using the RDBMS PostgreSQL database but due to scalability issues uber switched to various databases. Uber uses a NoSQL database (schemaless) built on top of the MySQL database.

---

Earth has a spherical shape so it’s difficult to do summarization and approximation by using latitude and longitude. To solve this problem Uber uses the Google S2 library. This library divides the map data into tiny cells (for example 3km) and gives a unique ID to each cell. This is an easy way to spread data in the distributed system and store it easily.
S2 library gives coverage for any given shape easily. Suppose you want to figure out all the supplies available within a 3km radius of a city.
Using the S2 libraries you can draw a circle of 3km radius and it will filter out all the cells with IDs that lie in that particular circle.
This way you can easily match the rider to the driver and you can easily find out the number of cars(supply) available in a particular region.

We can represent the entire road network on a graph to calculate the ETAs. We can use AI-simulated algorithms or simple Dijkstra’s algorithm to find out the best route in this graph.
In that graph, nodes represent intersections (available cabs), and edges represent road segments.
We represent the road segment distance or the traveling time through the edge weight. We also represent and model some additional factors in our graph such as one-way streets, turn costs, turn restrictions, and speed limits. 
Once the data structure is decided we can find the best route using Dijkstra’s search algorithm which is one of the best modern routing algorithms today. For faster performance, we also need to use OSRM (Open Source Routing Machine) which is based on contraction hierarchies.

Getting the hassle-free transportation service(Uber, Ola) is very easy but is it also simple to build these gigantic applications that have hundreds of software engineers working on them for a decade? surely not. These systems have much more complex architecture and there are a lot of components joined together internally to provide riding services all over the world.

The database should be horizontally scalable. You can linearly add capacity by adding more servers.
It should be able to handle a lot of reads and writes because once every 4-second cabs will be sending the GPS location and that location will be updated in the database.
The system should never give downtime for any operation. It should be highly available no matter what operation you perform (expanding storage, backup, when new nodes are added, etc).
Earlier Uber was using the RDBMS PostgreSQL database but due to scalability issues uber switched to various databases. Uber uses a NoSQL database (schemaless) built on top of the MySQL database.

3.3 Supply Service And How it Works?
In our case, cabs are the supply services and they will be tracked by geolocation (latitude and longitude).
All the active cabs keep on sending the location to the server once every 4 seconds through a web application firewall and load balancer.
The accurate GPS location is sent to the data center through Kafka’s Rest APIs once it passes through the load balancer. Here we use Apache Kafka as the data hub.
Once the latest location is updated by Kafka it slowly passes through the respective worker notes’ main memory.
Also, a copy of the location (state machine/latest location of cabs) will be sent to the database and to the dispatch optimization to keep the latest location updated.

Supply sends the request to the specific server based on the GPS location data. After that, the system draws the circle and filters out all the nearby cabs which meet the rider’s requirements.
After that, the list of the cab is sent to the ETA to calculate the distance between the rider and the cab, not geographically but by the road system.
The sorted ETA is then sent back to the supply system to offer to a driver.
If we need to handle the traffic for the newly added city then we can increase the number of servers and allocate the responsibilities of newly added cities’ cell IDs to these servers.

Redis for both caching and queuing. Some are behind Twemproxy (which provides scalability of the caching layer). Some are behind a custom clustering system.
Uber uses Schemaless (built in-house on top of MySQL), Riak, and Cassandra. Schemaless is for long-term data storage. Riak and Cassandra meet high-availability, low-latency demands.

Customer Service: This service handles concerns related to customers such as customer information and authentication.
Driver Service: This service handles driver-related concerns such as authentication and driver information.
Payment Service: This service will be responsible for handling payments in our system.

Grade A: This subregion is responsible to cover the urban centers and commute areas. Around 90% of Uber traffic gets covered in this subregion, so it’s important to build the highest quality map for subregion A. 
Grade B: This subregion covers the rural and suburban areas which are less populated and less traveled by Uber customers. 
Grade AB: A union of grade A and B subregions. 
Grade C: Covers the set of highway corridors connecting various Uber Territories.  
3.8 How Does Uber Build the Map?
Uber uses a third-party map service provider to build the map in their application. Earlier Uber was using Mapbox services but later Uber switched to Google Maps API to track the location and calculate ETAs.

The database should be horizontally scalable. You can linearly add capacity by adding more servers.
It should be able to handle a lot of reads and writes because once every 4-second cabs will be sending the GPS location and that location will be updated in the database.
The system should never give downtime for any operation. It should be highly available no matter what operation you perform (expanding storage, backup, when new nodes are added, etc).

When a rider requests a cab from a location the app not only identifies the free/idle cabs but also includes the cabs which are about to finish a ride.
It may be possible that one of the cabs which are about to finish the ride is closer to the demand than the cab which is far away from the user. So many Uber cars on the road send GPS locations every 4 seconds, so to predict traffic we can use the driver’s app’s GPS location data.

It maintains consistent hashing to assign the work across the workers. It helps in sharding the application in a way that’s scalable and fault-tolerant.
Ringpop uses RPC (Remote Procedure Call) protocol to make calls from one server to another server.
Ringpop also uses a SWIM membership protocol/gossip protocol that allows independent workers to discover each other’s responsibilities. This way each server/node knows the responsibility and the work of other nodes.
Ringpop detects the newly added nodes to the cluster and the node which is removed from the cluster. It distributes the loads evenly when a node is added or removed. 
3.7 How Does Uber Defines a Map Region?

---

We also need to track a few more things such as the number of seats, the presence of a car seat for children, the type of vehicle, can a wheelchair be fit, and allocation ( for example, a cab may have four seats but two of those are occupied.) 
3.4 Demand Service And How it Works?
Demand service receives the request of the cab through a web socket and it tracks the GPS location of the user. It also receives different kinds of requirements such as the number of seats, type of car, or pool car.
Demand gives the location (cell ID) and user requirement to supply and make requests for the cabs. 
3.5 How Dispatch System Match the Riders to Drivers?

---

Supply sends the request to the specific server based on the GPS location data. After that, the system draws the circle and filters out all the nearby cabs which meet the rider’s requirements.
After that, the list of the cab is sent to the ETA to calculate the distance between the rider and the cab, not geographically but by the road system.
The sorted ETA is then sent back to the supply system to offer to a driver.
If we need to handle the traffic for the newly added city then we can increase the number of servers and allocate the responsibilities of newly added cities’ cell IDs to these servers.

---

3.3 Supply Service And How it Works?
In our case, cabs are the supply services and they will be tracked by geolocation (latitude and longitude).
All the active cabs keep on sending the location to the server once every 4 seconds through a web application firewall and load balancer.
The accurate GPS location is sent to the data center through Kafka’s Rest APIs once it passes through the load balancer. Here we use Apache Kafka as the data hub.
Once the latest location is updated by Kafka it slowly passes through the respective worker notes’ main memory.
Also, a copy of the location (state machine/latest location of cabs) will be sent to the database and to the dispatch optimization to keep the latest location updated.

We can represent the entire road network on a graph to calculate the ETAs. We can use AI-simulated algorithms or simple Dijkstra’s algorithm to find out the best route in this graph.
In that graph, nodes represent intersections (available cabs), and edges represent road segments.
We represent the road segment distance or the traveling time through the edge weight. We also represent and model some additional factors in our graph such as one-way streets, turn costs, turn restrictions, and speed limits. 
Once the data structure is decided we can find the best route using Dijkstra’s search algorithm which is one of the best modern routing algorithms today. For faster performance, we also need to use OSRM (Open Source Routing Machine) which is based on contraction hierarchies.

Earlier Uber was built on the “monolithic” software architecture model.
They had a backend service, a frontend service, and a single database.
They used Python and its frameworks and SQLAlchemy as the ORM layer to the database.
This architecture was fine for a small number of trips in a few cities but when the service started expanding in other cities Uber team started facing the issue with the application.
After the year 2014 Uber team decided to switch to the “service-oriented architecture” and now Uber also handles food delivery and cargo.

3.7 How Does Uber Defines a Map Region?

---

Earth has a spherical shape so it’s difficult to do summarization and approximation by using latitude and longitude. To solve this problem Uber uses the Google S2 library. This library divides the map data into tiny cells (for example 3km) and gives a unique ID to each cell. This is an easy way to spread data in the distributed system and store it easily.
S2 library gives coverage for any given shape easily. Suppose you want to figure out all the supplies available within a 3km radius of a city.
Using the S2 libraries you can draw a circle of 3km radius and it will filter out all the cells with IDs that lie in that particular circle.
This way you can easily match the rider to the driver and you can easily find out the number of cars(supply) available in a particular region.

---

ETA is calculated based on the road system (not geographically) and there are a lot of factors involved in computing the ETA (like heavy traffic or road construction).
When a rider requests a cab from a location the app not only identifies the free/idle cabs but also includes the cabs which are about to finish a ride.
It may be possible that one of the cabs which are about to finish the ride is closer to the demand than the cab which is far away from the user. So many Uber cars on the road send GPS locations every 4 seconds, so to predict traffic we can use the driver’s app’s GPS location data.

---

3.3 Supply Service And How it Works?
In our case, cabs are the supply services and they will be tracked by geolocation (latitude and longitude).
All the active cabs keep on sending the location to the server once every 4 seconds through a web application firewall and load balancer.
The accurate GPS location is sent to the data center through Kafka’s Rest APIs once it passes through the load balancer. Here we use Apache Kafka as the data hub.
Once the latest location is updated by Kafka it slowly passes through the respective worker notes’ main memory.
Also, a copy of the location (state machine/latest location of cabs) will be sent to the database and to the dispatch optimization to keep the latest location updated.

---

Supply sends the request to the specific server based on the GPS location data. After that, the system draws the circle and filters out all the nearby cabs which meet the rider’s requirements.
After that, the list of the cab is sent to the ETA to calculate the distance between the rider and the cab, not geographically but by the road system.
The sorted ETA is then sent back to the supply system to offer to a driver.
If we need to handle the traffic for the newly added city then we can increase the number of servers and allocate the responsibilities of newly added cities’ cell IDs to these servers.

---

The database should be horizontally scalable. You can linearly add capacity by adding more servers.
It should be able to handle a lot of reads and writes because once every 4-second cabs will be sending the GPS location and that location will be updated in the database.
The system should never give downtime for any operation. It should be highly available no matter what operation you perform (expanding storage, backup, when new nodes are added, etc).
Earlier Uber was using the RDBMS PostgreSQL database but due to scalability issues uber switched to various databases. Uber uses a NoSQL database (schemaless) built on top of the MySQL database.

3.5 How Dispatch System Match the Riders to Drivers?
We have discussed that DISCO divides the map into tiny cells with a unique ID. This ID is used as a sharding key in DISCO. When supply receives the request from demand the location gets updated using the cell ID as a shard key.
These tiny cells’ responsibilities will be divided into different servers lies in multiple regions (consistent hashing).
For example, we can allocate the responsibility of 12 tiny cells to 6 different servers (2 cells for each server) lying in 6 different regions.

Getting the hassle-free transportation service(Uber, Ola) is very easy but is it also simple to build these gigantic applications that have hundreds of software engineers working on them for a decade? surely not. These systems have much more complex architecture and there are a lot of components joined together internally to provide riding services all over the world.

Is there any mention of selecting the right hardware or VM instance types?,"ETA is calculated based on the road system (not geographically) and there are a lot of factors involved in computing the ETA (like heavy traffic or road construction).
When a rider requests a cab from a location the app not only identifies the free/idle cabs but also includes the cabs which are about to finish a ride.
It may be possible that one of the cabs which are about to finish the ride is closer to the demand than the cab which is far away from the user. So many Uber cars on the road send GPS locations every 4 seconds, so to predict traffic we can use the driver’s app’s GPS location data.

The database should be horizontally scalable. You can linearly add capacity by adding more servers.
It should be able to handle a lot of reads and writes because once every 4-second cabs will be sending the GPS location and that location will be updated in the database.

Earlier Uber was using the RDBMS PostgreSQL database but due to scalability issues uber switched to various databases. Uber uses a NoSQL database (schemaless) built on top of the MySQL database.

Supply sends the request to the specific server based on the GPS location data. After that, the system draws the circle and filters out all the nearby cabs which meet the rider’s requirements.
After that, the list of the cab is sent to the ETA to calculate the distance between the rider and the cab, not geographically but by the road system.
The sorted ETA is then sent back to the supply system to offer to a driver.
If we need to handle the traffic for the newly added city then we can increase the number of servers and allocate the responsibilities of newly added cities’ cell IDs to these servers.

Grade A: This subregion is responsible to cover the urban centers and commute areas. Around 90% of Uber traffic gets covered in this subregion, so it’s important to build the highest quality map for subregion A. 
Grade B: This subregion covers the rural and suburban areas which are less populated and less traveled by Uber customers. 
Grade AB: A union of grade A and B subregions. 
Grade C: Covers the set of highway corridors connecting various Uber Territories.  
3.8 How Does Uber Build the Map?
Uber uses a third-party map service provider to build the map in their application. Earlier Uber was using Mapbox services but later Uber switched to Google Maps API to track the location and calculate ETAs.

---

We can represent the entire road network on a graph to calculate the ETAs. We can use AI-simulated algorithms or simple Dijkstra’s algorithm to find out the best route in this graph.
In that graph, nodes represent intersections (available cabs), and edges represent road segments.
We represent the road segment distance or the traveling time through the edge weight. We also represent and model some additional factors in our graph such as one-way streets, turn costs, turn restrictions, and speed limits. 
Once the data structure is decided we can find the best route using Dijkstra’s search algorithm which is one of the best modern routing algorithms today. For faster performance, we also need to use OSRM (Open Source Routing Machine) which is based on contraction hierarchies.

Using the S2 libraries you can draw a circle of 3km radius and it will filter out all the cells with IDs that lie in that particular circle.
This way you can easily match the rider to the driver and you can easily find out the number of cars(supply) available in a particular region.
