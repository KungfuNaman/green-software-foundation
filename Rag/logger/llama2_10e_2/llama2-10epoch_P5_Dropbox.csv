This will be a global request queue shared among all the clients.
Whenever a client receives any update or changes in the files/folder it sends the request through the request queue.
This request is received by the synchronization service to update the metadata database.
Response Queue:
There will be an individual response queue corresponding to the individual clients.
The synchronization service broadcast the update through this response queue and this response queue will deliver the updated messages to each client and then these clients will update their respective files accordingly.
The message will never be lost even if the client will be disconnected from the internet (the benefit of using the messaging queue service).

Everything is fine till here but later if you have to make an update in your file then it’s not a good idea to edit the file and upload the whole file again and again into the cloud. The reason is:

5. Database Design for Dropbox System Design
To understand Database design one should understand

Each user must have at-least one device.
Each device will have at-least one object (file or folder). Once user registers, we create a root folder for him/her making sure he/she has at-least one object.
Each object may have chunks. Only files can have chunk, folders can’t have chunks.
Each object may be shared with one or multiple users. This mapping is maintained in AccessControlList.
We need the following tables to store our data:

5.1 Users
Users

More bandwidth and cloud space utilization:
To provide a history of the files you need to keep multiple versions of the files.
This requires more bandwidth and more space in the cloud. Even for the small changes in your file, you will have to back up and transfer the whole file into the cloud again and again which is not a good idea.
Latency or Concurrency Utilization:
You can’t do time optimization as well. It will consume more time to upload a single file as a whole even if you make small changes in your file.
It’s also not possible to make use of concurrency to upload/download the files using multi threads or multi processes.

This will be a global request queue shared among all the clients.
Whenever a client receives any update or changes in the files/folder it sends the request through the request queue.
This request is received by the synchronization service to update the metadata database.
Response Queue:
There will be an individual response queue corresponding to the individual clients.
The synchronization service broadcast the update through this response queue and this response queue will deliver the updated messages to each client and then these clients will update their respective files accordingly.
The message will never be lost even if the client will be disconnected from the internet (the benefit of using the messaging queue service).

You can use RDBMS or NoSQL but make sure that you meet the data consistency property because multiple clients will be working on the same file.
With RDBMS there is no problem with the consistency but with NoSQL, you will get eventual consistency.
Lets understand how we can efficientlt do relational database scaling

4.2.1 Relational Database Scaling:
Relational databases like MySQL may face scalability challenges as the data and traffic grow.

5. Database Design for Dropbox System Design
To understand Database design one should understand

Each user must have at-least one device.
Each device will have at-least one object (file or folder). Once user registers, we create a root folder for him/her making sure he/she has at-least one object.
Each object may have chunks. Only files can have chunk, folders can’t have chunks.
Each object may be shared with one or multiple users. This mapping is maintained in AccessControlList.
We need the following tables to store our data:

5.1 Users
Users

{
  user_id(PK)

  last_login_at
  created_at
  updated_at

More bandwidth and cloud space utilization:
To provide a history of the files you need to keep multiple versions of the files.
This requires more bandwidth and more space in the cloud. Even for the small changes in your file, you will have to back up and transfer the whole file into the cloud again and again which is not a good idea.
Latency or Concurrency Utilization:
You can’t do time optimization as well. It will consume more time to upload a single file as a whole even if you make small changes in your file.
It’s also not possible to make use of concurrency to upload/download the files using multi threads or multi processes.

Is there any mention of queuing non-urgent processing requests,"7. Scalabilty for Dropbox System Design
Horizontal Scaling
We can add more servers behind the load balancer to increase the capacity of each service. This is known as Horizontal Scaling and each service can be independently scaled horizontally in our design.
Database Sharding
Metadata DB is sharded based on object_id. Our hash function will map each object_id to a random server where we can store the file/folder metadata. To query for a particular object_id, service can determine the database server using same hash function and query for data. This approach will distribute our database load to multiple servers making it scalable.

ORM, within the edge wrapper, enables the application to interact with the database using high-level programming constructs, reducing the need for developers to write complex SQL queries.
This combination of edge wrapper and ORM simplifies database management, making it easier to scale the application horizontally with sharded databases while maintaining a cohesive and developer-friendly interface.

1. Requirements Gathering for Dropbox System Design
Functional Requirements:
The user should be able to upload photos/files.
The user should be able to create/delete directories on the drive.
The user should be able to download files
The user should be able to share the uploaded files.
The drive should synchronize the data between user all devices.
Non Functional Requirements:

---

More bandwidth and cloud space utilization:
To provide a history of the files you need to keep multiple versions of the files.
This requires more bandwidth and more space in the cloud. Even for the small changes in your file, you will have to back up and transfer the whole file into the cloud again and again which is not a good idea.
Latency or Concurrency Utilization:
You can’t do time optimization as well. It will consume more time to upload a single file as a whole even if you make small changes in your file.
It’s also not possible to make use of concurrency to upload/download the files using multi threads or multi processes.
Let’s discuss how we can solve this problem:

200 OK
Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=""<chunk_id>""
Content-Length: 4096000
The response will contain Content-Disposition header as attachment which will instruct the client to download the chunk. Note that Content-Length is set as 4096000 as each chunk is of 4 MB.

6.2 Upload Chunk
This API would be used to upload the chunk of a file.

Request

POST /api/v1/chunks/:chunk_id
X-API-Key: api_key
Authorization: auth_token
Content-Type: application/octet-stream
/path/to/chunk
Response

200 OK
6.3 Get Objects
This API would be used by clients to query Meta Service for new files/folders when they come online. Client will pass the maximum object id present locally and the unique device id.

This will be a global request queue shared among all the clients.
Whenever a client receives any update or changes in the files/folder it sends the request through the request queue.
This request is received by the synchronization service to update the metadata database.

There will be an individual response queue corresponding to the individual clients.
The synchronization service broadcast the update through this response queue and this response queue will deliver the updated messages to each client and then these clients will update their respective files accordingly.
The message will never be lost even if the client will be disconnected from the internet (the benefit of using the messaging queue service).

5. Database Design for Dropbox System Design
To understand Database design one should understand

Each user must have at-least one device.
Each device will have at-least one object (file or folder). Once user registers, we create a root folder for him/her making sure he/she has at-least one object.
Each object may have chunks. Only files can have chunk, folders can’t have chunks.
Each object may be shared with one or multiple users. This mapping is maintained in AccessControlList.
We need the following tables to store our data:

5.1 Users
Users

{
  user_id(PK)
  name
  email
  password
  last_login_at
  created_at

3.8. Downloading Services:
Clients initiate file download requests through the client application. The Download Service queries the Metadata Database for file details. The server’s Download Service retrieves metadata from the Metadata Database. Metadata includes information such as file name, size, owner, and access permissions.

4. Low-Level Design(LLD) of Dropbox System Design
A lot of people assume designing a Dropbox is that all they just need to do is to use some cloud services, upload the file, and download the file whenever they want but that’s not how it works. The core problem is “Where and how to save the files? “. Suppose you want to share a file that can be of any size (small or big) and you upload it into the cloud.

---

Cache Sharding
Similar to Metadata DB Sharding, we are distributing the cache to multiple servers. In-fact Redis has out of box support for partitioning the data across multiple Redis instances. Usage of Consistent Hashing for distributing data across instances ensures that load is equally distributed if one instance goes away.
8. Conclusion
In conclusion, the design of the Dropbox system incorporates a well-thought-out architecture that seamlessly handles user file uploads, downloads, metadata management, and storage using a set of key components.

Scaling can be achieved using techniques such as vertical scaling (increasing hardware capabilities) or horizontal scaling (adding more machines).
However, horizontal scaling for relational databases often involves complexities, especially in scenarios with high read and write operations.
4.2.2 Database Sharding:
Database sharding is a horizontal partitioning technique where a large database is divided into smaller, more manageable parts called shards.

The synchronization service is designed to use a message queue to update the metadata database, which allows for asynchronous communication and reduces latency. Additionally, the use of cloud storage services like Amazon S3 provides a scalable and fault-tolerant solution for storing chunks of files.

The design also emphasizes the importance of statelessness in allowing multiple clients to access the service without affecting performance. By using a message queue, each client's updates are processed independently, ensuring that no single client has control over the service. This allows for horizontal scaling and improved reliability.

Overall, the design seems to prioritize scalability, reliability, and fault tolerance, which are all critical features of a stateless system.

Let’s assume we have a client installed on our computer (an app installed on your computer) and this client has 4 basic components. These basic components are Watcher, Chunker, Indexer, and Internal DB. We have considered only one client but there can be multiple clients belonging to the same user with the same basic components.

---

3.2. Upload Service:
Receives file upload requests from clients. Generates Presigned URLs for S3 to allow clients to upload directly. Coordinates the upload process, ensuring data integrity and completeness. After successful upload, it updates the Metadata Database with file details. Coordinates the upload process, breaking down large files into manageable chunks if necessary.

3.3. Getting Presigned URL:
The client application requests a Presigned URL from the Upload Service. The server generates the Presigned URL by interacting with the S3 service, creating a unique token for the specific upload operation. These URLs grant temporary, secure access to upload a specific file to a designated S3 bucket. Allows clients to bypass the server for direct communication with the storage layer.

It handles tasks like routing queries to the appropriate shard, managing transactions across shards, and abstracting the underlying complexities of database sharding.
ORM, within the edge wrapper, enables the application to interact with the database using high-level programming constructs, reducing the need for developers to write complex SQL queries.
This combination of edge wrapper and ORM simplifies database management, making it easier to scale the application horizontally with sharded databases while maintaining a cohesive and developer-friendly interface.

Cache Sharding
Similar to Metadata DB Sharding, we are distributing the cache to multiple servers. In-fact Redis has out of box support for partitioning the data across multiple Redis instances. Usage of Consistent Hashing for distributing data across instances ensures that load is equally distributed if one instance goes away.

5. Database Design for Dropbox System Design
To understand Database design one should understand

Each user must have at-least one device.
Each device will have at-least one object (file or folder). Once user registers, we create a root folder for him/her making sure he/she has at-least one object.
Each object may have chunks. Only files can have chunk, folders can’t have chunks.
Each object may be shared with one or multiple users. This mapping is maintained in AccessControlList.
We need the following tables to store our data:

5.1 Users

More bandwidth and cloud space utilization:
To provide a history of the files you need to keep multiple versions of the files.
This requires more bandwidth and more space in the cloud. Even for the small changes in your file, you will have to back up and transfer the whole file into the cloud again and again which is not a good idea.
Latency or Concurrency Utilization:
You can’t do time optimization as well. It will consume more time to upload a single file as a whole even if you make small changes in your file.
It’s also not possible to make use of concurrency to upload/download the files using multi threads or multi processes.

Low-Level Design(LLD) of Dropbox System Design\nA lot of people assume designing a Dropbox is that all they just need to do is to use some cloud services, upload the file, and download the file whenever they want but that’s not how it works. The core problem is “Where and how to save the files? “. Suppose you want to share a file that can be of any size (small or big) and you upload it into the cloud.', metadata={'id': 'documentsFromText/Dropbox/content.txt:None:8', 'source': 'documentsFromText/Dropbox/content.txt'}), Document(page_content='More bandwidth and cloud space utilization:\nTo provide a history of the files you need to keep multiple versions of the files.\nThis requires more bandwidth and more space in the cloud. Even for the small changes in your file, you will have to back up and transfer the whole file into the cloud again and again which is not a good idea.\nLatency or Concurrency Utilization:\nYou can’t do time optimization as well. It will consume more time to upload a single file as a whole even if you make small changes in your file.\nIt’s also not possible to make use of concurrency to upload/download the files using multi threads or multi processes.\nLet’s discuss how we can solve this problem:\ndesign-dropbox-1', metadata={'id': 'documentsFromText/Dropbox/content.txt:None:10', 'source': 'documentsFromText/Dropbox/content.txt'}), Document(page_content='5. Database Design for Dropbox System Design\nTo understand Database design one should understand\n\nEach user must have at-least one device.\nEach device will have at-least one object (file or folder). Once user registers, we create a root folder for him/her making sure he/she has at-least one object.\nEach object may have chunks. Only files can have chunk, folders can’t have chunks.\nEach object may be shared with one or multiple users. This mapping is maintained in AccessControlList.\nWe need the following tables to store our data:\n\n5.1 Users\nUsers\n\n{\n  user_id(PK)\n  name\n  email\n  password\n  last_login_at\n  created_at\n  updated_at\n}\n5.2 Devices\nDevices\n\n{\n  device_id(PK)\n  user_id(FK)\n  created_at\n  updated_at\n}\n5.3 Objects\nObjects', metadata={'id': 'documentsFromText/Dropbox/content.txt:None:29', 'source': 'documentsFromText/Dropbox/content.txt'}), Document(page_content='Now let’s talk about the various components for the complete low level design solution of the Dropbox.', metadata={'id': 'documentsFromText/Dropbox/content.txt:None:13', 'source': 'documentsFromText/Dropbox/content.txt'})]"
