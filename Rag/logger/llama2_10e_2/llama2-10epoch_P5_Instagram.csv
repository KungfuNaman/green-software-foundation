1. Scalability: The system is designed to handle millions of users, indicating that it needs to scale its computational resources and storage capabilities to accommodate a large number of users. This suggests that the infrastructure can be scaled up or down based on real-time user demand.
2. News feed generation: The system generates a news feed consisting of photos and videos from all the accounts followed by the users. This implies that the system needs to process and generate content in real-time, which may require scaling resources based on user activity.
3. User monitoring: The system provides a feature for users to monitor their notifications feed, indicating that there may be a need to scale infrastructure to handle real-time updates from followers.

Given these design considerations, it is likely that the infrastructure of Instagram is designed to scale based on real-time user demand, particularly in areas such as processing and storing content, and generating news feeds.

10. Scalability for Instagram System Design
Scalability refers to the ability of an organization (or a system, such as a computer network) to perform well under an increased or expanding workload. A system that scales well will be able to maintain or increase its level of performance even as it is tested by larger and larger operational demands.

We can add more servers to application service layers to make the scalability better and handle numerous requests from the clients. We can also increase the number of databases to store the growing users’ data.

3.1 Storage Per Day
Photos: 60 million photos/day * 3 MB = 180 TeraBytes / day
Videos: 35 million videos/day * 150 MB = 5250 TB / day
Total content size = 180 + 5250 = 5430 TB
The Total Space required for a Year:
5430 TB/day * 365 (days a year) = 1981950 TB = 1981.95 PetaBytes

3.2 Bandwidth Estimation
5430 TB/(24 * 60* 60) = 5430 TB/86400 sec ~= 62.84 GB/s ~= 502.8 Gbps

However, the architecture described does have some non-functional requirements related to security, such as scalability and availability. These are important aspects of security posture, as a system that is not designed to scale or be highly available may be more susceptible to security threats.

It would be prudent for the designers of this system to consider implementing regular vulnerability scanning and penetration testing to ensure that their security posture remains strong over time. This could involve using automated tools to scan for known vulnerabilities, as well as conducting manual penetration testing to identify potential weaknesses in the system.

Additionally, the designers should consider implementing a continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) pipeline that includes security testing as part of its build process. This would allow any security issues identified during testing to be addressed before the software is released to users.

Consistency: We can compromise a little on consistency. It is acceptable if the content (photos or videos) takes time to show in followers’ feeds located in a distant region.
Reliability: The system must be able to tolerate hardware and software failures.
3. Capacity Estimation for Instagram System Design
We have 1 billion users, with 500 million as daily active users. Assume 60 million photos and 35 million videos are shared on Instagram per day. We can consider 3 MB as the maximum size of each photo and 150 MB as the maximum size of each video uploaded on Instagram.On average, each user sends 20 requests (of any type) per day to our service.

3.1 Storage Per Day
Photos: 60 million photos/day * 3 MB = 180 TeraBytes / day
Videos: 35 million videos/day * 150 MB = 5250 TB / day
Total content size = 180 + 5250 = 5430 TB
The Total Space required for a Year:
5430 TB/day * 365 (days a year) = 1981950 TB = 1981.95 PetaBytes

3.2 Bandwidth Estimation
5430 TB/(24 * 60* 60) = 5430 TB/86400 sec ~= 62.84 GB/s ~= 502.8 Gbps

The article states that ""Instagram follows strong Architecture"" and later discusses how important topics for Instagram system design include ""designing posts and videos, following and unfollowing users, liking and disliking posts, searching photos and videos, and generating news feeds.""

The context also mentions the use of databases to handle replication and redundancy, ensuring reliability. The article further discusses load balancing as a way to route requests around failed servers, highlighting the importance of availability in the system's design.

In addition, the context touches on the topic of hashtags, which are pre-trained models that can be used to generate content recommendations for users. The article notes that Instagram's success is not only attributed to its user-friendly interface but also to the robust backend infrastructure that supports its massive user base and dynamic content.

3.1 Storage Per Day
Photos: 60 million photos/day * 3 MB = 180 TeraBytes / day
Videos: 35 million videos/day * 150 MB = 5250 TB / day
Total content size = 180 + 5250 = 5430 TB
The Total Space required for a Year:
5430 TB/day * 365 (days a year) = 1981950 TB = 1981.95 PetaBytes

3.2 Bandwidth Estimation
5430 TB/(24 * 60* 60) = 5430 TB/86400 sec ~= 62.84 GB/s ~= 502.8 Gbps
Incoming bandwidth ~= 502.8 Gbps

10. Scalability for Instagram System Design
Scalability refers to the ability of an organization (or a system, such as a computer network) to perform well under an increased or expanding workload. A system that scales well will be able to maintain or increase its level of performance even as it is tested by larger and larger operational demands.

We can add more servers to application service layers to make the scalability better and handle numerous requests from the clients. We can also increase the number of databases to store the growing users’ data.

Is there any mention of selecting the right hardware or VM instance types?,"Notification Service:
Informs users about relevant events like likes, comments, mentions, and follows.
Pushes notifications to mobile devices through platforms like Firebase Cloud Messaging or Amazon SNS.
Leverages a queueing system for asynchronous notification delivery.
Analytics Service:
Tracks user engagement, post performance, and overall platform usage.
Gathers data on views, likes, comments, shares, and clicks.
Provides insights to improve user experience, optimize content recommendations, and target advertising.
Why we need caching for storing the data?
Cache the data to handle millions of reads. It improves the user experience by making the fetching process fast. We’ll also opt for lazy loading, which minimizes the client’s waiting time.

API Endpoints:

GET /posts/{post_id}: Retrieves details of a post, including the number of likes/dislikes.
POST /posts/{post_id}/like: Registers a like for the post by the authenticated user.
POST /posts/{post_id}/dislike: Registers a dislike for the post by the authenticated user.
DELETE /posts/{post_id}/like: Removes the like for the post by the authenticated user (if previously done).
DELETE /posts/{post_id}/dislike: Removes the dislike for the post by the authenticated user (if previously done).
