The following steps describe the communication between both clients:

User A and user B create a communication channel with the chat server.
User A sends a message to the chat server.
Upon receiving the message, the chat server acknowledges back to user A.
The chat server sends the message to user B and stores the message in the database if the receiver’s status is offline.
User B sends an acknowledgment to the chat server.
The chat server notifies user A that the message has been successfully delivered.
When user B reads the message, the application notifies the chat server.
The chat server notifies user A that user B has read the message.

Consistency: Messages should be delivered in the order they were sent.
Availability: The system should be highly available. However, the availability can be compromised in the interest of consistency.
Security: The system must be secure via end-to-end encryption. The end-to-end encryption ensures that only the two communicating parties can see the content of messages. Nobody in between, not even WhatsApp, should have access.
Scalability: The system should be highly scalable to support an ever-increasing number of users and messages per day.
Capacity Estimation
Storage Estimation:
100 billion messages are shared through WhatsApp per day and each message takes 100 bytes on average
100 billion/day∗100 Bytes = 10 TB/day
For 30 days, the storage capacity would become the following:

Message service is a repository of messages on top of the Mnesia database cluster. It acts as an interface to the Mnesia database for other services interacting with the databases. It is responsible for storing and retrieving messages from the Mnesia database. It also deletes messages from the Mnesia database after a configurable amount of time. And, it exposes APIs to receive messages by various filters, such as user ID, message ID, and so on.

1. Connection with Websocket Server
In WhatsApp, each active device is connected with a WebSocket server via WebSocket protocol. A WebSocket server keeps the connection open with all the active (online) users. Since one server isn’t enough to handle billions of devices, there should be enough servers to handle billions of users.

Functional Requirement
Conversation: The system should support one-on-one and group conversations between users.
Acknowledgment: The system should support message delivery acknowledgment, such as sent, delivered, and read.
Sharing: The system should support sharing of media files, such as images, videos, and audio.
Chat storage: The system must support the persistent storage of chat messages when a user is offline until the successful delivery of messages.
Push notifications: The system should be able to notify offline users of new messages once their status becomes online.
Non-Functional Requirement
Low latency: Users should be able to receive messages with low latency.
Consistency: Messages should be delivered in the order they were sent.

4. Support for Group messages
Since user A is connected to a WebSocket server, it sends a message to the message service intended for Group A.The message service sends the message to Kafka with other specific information about the group. The message is saved there for further processing. In Kafka terminology, a group can be a topic, and the senders and receivers can be producers and consumers, respectively.

Message service is a repository of messages on top of the Mnesia database cluster. It acts as an interface to the Mnesia database for other services interacting with the databases. It is responsible for storing and retrieving messages from the Mnesia database. It also deletes messages from the Mnesia database after a configurable amount of time.

Functional Requirement
Conversation: The system should support one-on-one and group conversations between users.
Acknowledgment: The system should support message delivery acknowledgment, such as sent, delivered, and read.
Sharing: The system should support sharing of media files, such as images, videos, and audio.
Chat storage: The system must support the persistent storage of chat messages when a user is offline until the successful delivery of messages.
Push notifications: The system should be able to notify offline users of new messages once their status becomes online.
Non-Functional Requirement
Low latency: Users should be able to receive messages with low latency.

1. Connection with Websocket Server
In WhatsApp, each active device is connected with a WebSocket server via WebSocket protocol. A WebSocket server keeps the connection open with all the active (online) users. Since one server isn’t enough to handle billions of devices, there should be enough servers to handle billions of users.

4. Support for Group messages
Since user A is connected to a WebSocket server, it sends a message to the message service intended for Group A.The message service sends the message to Kafka with other specific information about the group. The message is saved there for further processing. In Kafka terminology, a group can be a topic, and the senders and receivers can be producers and consumers, respectively.

This API is used to send a text message from a sender to a receiver by making a POST API call to the /messages API endpoint. Generally, the sender’s and receiver’s IDs are their phone numbers.

Get Message
getMessage(user_Id)

Using this API call, users can fetch all unread messages when they come online after being offline for some time.

Upload File
uploadFile(file_type, file)

We can upload media files via the uploadFile API by making a POST request to the /v1/media API endpoint. A successful response returns an ID that’s forwarded to the receiver.

This API is used to send a text message from a sender to a receiver by making a POST API call to the /messages API endpoint. Generally, the sender’s and receiver’s IDs are their phone numbers.

Get Message
getMessage(user_Id)

Using this API call, users can fetch all unread messages when they come online after being offline for some time.

Upload File
uploadFile(file_type, file)

We can upload media files via the uploadFile API by making a POST request to the /v1/media API endpoint. A successful response returns an ID that’s forwarded to the receiver.

Low Level Design (LLD) of System Design
Low-Level-Design(LLD)-of-WhatsApp-Messenger

1. Connection with Websocket Server
In WhatsApp, each active device is connected with a WebSocket server via WebSocket protocol. A WebSocket server keeps the connection open with all the active (online) users. Since one server isn’t enough to handle billions of devices, there should be enough servers to handle billions of users.

---

4. Support for Group messages
Since user A is connected to a WebSocket server, it sends a message to the message service intended for Group A.The message service sends the message to Kafka with other specific information about the group. The message is saved there for further processing. In Kafka terminology, a group can be a topic, and the senders and receivers can be producers and consumers, respectively.

Data Model Design:
Data-Model-Design",5.541366100311279," Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of selecting the right hardware or VM instance types for the designed system. However, there are some hints throughout the architecture and low-level design that suggest a focus on scalability and efficient use of resources:

1. Microservices architecture: The decision to use microservices suggests that each service can be scaled independently, allowing for better resource utilization and easier deployment of new services.
2. WebSocket protocol: Using WebSockets for connection management allows for efficient communication between devices and servers, as it is designed to handle high-performance, real-time data transfers.
3. Kafka messaging system: The use of Kafka for message processing suggests a focus on scalability and reliability, as it is designed to handle large volumes of messages in a distributed environment.
4. Storage capacity planning: The mention of storing 300 TB of data per month indicates some thought has been given to scaling storage resources appropriately for the expected volume of messages.
5. API design considerations: The focus on providing an acknowledgment of message delivery and read status suggests that the system is designed to handle efficient communication between clients and the server, with appropriate handling of message retries and re-delivery.
