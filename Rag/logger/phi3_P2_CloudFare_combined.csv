​​Hash steering
Hash steering is an endpoint steering algorithm that uses endpoint weight and the request’s source IP address to select an endpoint. The result is that every request from the same IP address will always steer to the same endpoint. It’s important to note that altering the order of endpoints or adding or removing endpoints from the endpoint pool could result in different outcomes when using the hash algorithm.

Response modification: While traditional security stacks often focus solely on requests, Workers empowers effortless modification of responses. For instance, verbose error messages can be obscured to enhance security.
Implement DevSecOps lifecycles: Workers makes it very easy to adhere to DevSecOps best practices like version control, code audits, automated tests, gradual roll-outs, and rollback capabilities.

Cloudflare Tunnel (cloudflared) can be installed directly on the endpoint or any server with IP connectivity to the endpoint. And because the connection to Cloudflare is initiated from where Cloudflare Tunnel was installed to Cloudflare, the only access needed is outbound access to Cloudflare. A single Cloudflare Tunnel can transport traffic to one or many different endpoints in one of two different ways, one which results in the endpoint being publicly accessible and one which keeps the endpoint completely only accessible privately.

Cloudflare Load Balancing is built on Cloudflare’s connectivity cloud, ​​a unified, intelligent platform of programmable cloud-native services that enable secure any-to-any connectivity between all networks (enterprise and Internet), cloud environments, applications, and users. It is one of the largest global networks, with data centers spanning more than 310 cities in over 120 countries and interconnection with over 13,000 other networks. It also has a greater presence in core Internet exchanges than many other large technology companies.

Cloudflare supports integrations with multiple identity providers, including of the same type. So if you manage an Okta instance for your employees, but may have acquired another company with its own Okta instance, both can be integrated with Cloudflare. Cloudflare then acts as a proxy for the SSO process. Applications are configured using SAML and OIDC to use Cloudflare for authentication and then Cloudflare in turn redirects users through the authentication flow of an integrated IdP. Group information can also be synchronized via SCIM into Cloudflare to be used in access control policies.

Cloudflare Tunnel (cloudflared) can be installed directly on the endpoint or any server with IP connectivity to the endpoint. And because the connection to Cloudflare is initiated from where Cloudflare Tunnel was installed to Cloudflare, the only access needed is outbound access to Cloudflare. A single Cloudflare Tunnel can transport traffic to one or many different endpoints in one of two different ways, one which results in the endpoint being publicly accessible and one which keeps the endpoint completely only accessible privately.

Cloudflare Tunnel (cloudflared) can be installed directly on the endpoint or any server with IP connectivity to the endpoint. And because the connection to Cloudflare is initiated from where Cloudflare Tunnel was installed to Cloudflare, the only access needed is outbound access to Cloudflare. A single Cloudflare Tunnel can transport traffic to one or many different endpoints in one of two different ways, one which results in the endpoint being publicly accessible and one which keeps the endpoint completely only accessible privately.

Hash steering is an endpoint steering algorithm that uses endpoint weight and the request’s source IP address to select an endpoint.

Cloudflare supports integrations with multiple identity providers, including of the same type. So if you manage an Okta instance for your employees, but may have acquired another company with its own Okta instance, both can be integrated with Cloudflare. Cloudflare then acts as a proxy for the SSO process. Applications are configured using SAML and OIDC to use Cloudflare for authentication and then Cloudflare in turn redirects users through the authentication flow of an integrated IdP. Group information can also be synchronized via SCIM into Cloudflare to be used in access control policies.

Cloudflare Tunnel (cloudflared) can be installed directly on the endpoint or any server with IP connectivity to the endpoint. And because the connection to Cloudflare is initiated from where Cloudflare Tunnel was installed to Cloudflare, the only access needed is outbound access to Cloudflare. A single Cloudflare Tunnel can transport traffic to one or many different endpoints in one of two different ways, one which results in the endpoint being publicly accessible and one which keeps the endpoint completely only accessible privately.

Now here is your input:
Answer the question based only on the following context:
The main goal of this design document was to provide a comprehensive understanding of how we can achieve an energy efficient and secure distributed computing environment while ensuring high availability, fault tolerance, and scalable performance. To accomplish our objective, several key technologies were considered for integration into our solution stack including Kubernetes as the orchestration platform along with various containerized services like Istio service mesh management tool to handle service discovery, load balancing, and encryption of communication channels between microservices running in Docker containers on-premises or within a private cloud.
For network traffic optimization across data centers globally, we planned leveraging Google's global edge caching infrastructure that allows for low latency access to frequently accessed static content like media files by replicating them closer to users geographically and reducing the load on origin servers through CDN technology with built-in DDoS protection mechanisms.
Data storage was designed using distributed database systems such as Apache Cassandra, which provides high availability, fault tolerance, data partitioning across multiple nodes for scalable performance without compromising write/read speeds even when the system scales to millions of requests per second during peak times. All our infrastructure components including compute resources were selected based on their energy efficiency credentials and certifications such as ENERGY STAR compliance where available, ensuring we are not just efficient in computation but also mindful about reducing carbon footprint by minimizing unnecessary data center activity throughput using techniques like batching and asynchronous processing.
In addition to infrastructure technologies for green computing practices, our security architecture incorporated robust multi-factor authentication (MFA), encryption protocols such as TLS with Perfect Forward Secrecy mode enabled at various levels of the application stack including transport layer where possible while also ensuring compliance standards like GDPR and CCPA are met. To further improve energy efficiency, we planned using AI algorithms for dynamic resource allocation in Kubernetes to automatically scale down or shut off idle computing resources without user intervention based on real-time usage data analytics minimizing wastage of computational power even when workloads fluctuate unpredictably during business cycles and seasons.
Our network infrastructure is designed using software defined networking (SDN) principles with support for protocols like OpenFlow to dynamically route traffic through the most energy efficient paths based on current load conditions, server health statuses, as well as predictive algorithms that can preemptively manage data flow patterns in anticipation of high demand periods. Our edge caching strategy is complemented by intelligent placement decisions and content replication policies optimized not only for performance but also to minimize unnecessary traffic across geographically distant locations thereby reducing carbon emissions associated with long haul networking activities along the pathways from origin servers to users, as well as back-hauling of data.
