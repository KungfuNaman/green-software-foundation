We are creating n number of response queues for n number of clients because the message will be deleted from the queue once it will be received by the client and we need to share the updated message with the various subscribed clients.
4.4. Synchronization Service
The client communicates with the synchronization services either to receive the latest update from the cloud storage or to send the latest request/updates to the Cloud Storage.

Let’s assume we have a client installed on our computer (an app installed on your computer) and this client has 4 basic components. These basic components are Watcher, Chunker, Indexer, and Internal DB. We have considered only one client but there can be multiple clients belonging to the same user with the same basic components.

Scaling can be achieved using techniques such as vertical scaling (increasing hardware capabilities) or horizontal scaling (adding more machines).
However, horizontal scaling for relational databases often involves complexities, especially in scenarios with high read and write operations.
4.2.2 Database Sharding:
Database sharding is a horizontal partitioning technique where a large database is divided into smaller, more manageable parts called shards.

Request Queue:
This will be a global request queue shared among all the clients.
Whenever a client receives any update or changes in the files/folder it sends the request through the request queue.
This request is received by the synchronization service to update the metadata database.
Response Queue:
There will be an individual response queue corresponding to the individual clients.
The synchronization service broadcast the update through this response queue and this response queue will deliver the updated messages to each client and then these clients will update their respective files accordingly.
The message will never be lost even if the client will be disconnected from the internet (the benefit of using the messaging queue service).

It gives a notification to the indexer and chunker if any action is performed in the files or folders.
Chunker breaks the files into multiple small pieces called chunks and uploads them to the cloud storage with a unique id or hash of these chunks.
To recreate the files these chunks can be joined together. For any changes in the files, the chunking algorithm detects the specific chunk which is modified and only saves that specific part/chunk to the cloud storage.
It reduces bandwidth usage, synchronization time, and storage space in the cloud.
Indexer is responsible for updating the internal database when it receives the notification from the watcher (for any action performed in folders/files).

It handles tasks like routing queries to the appropriate shard, managing transactions across shards, and abstracting the underlying complexities of database sharding.
ORM, within the edge wrapper, enables the application to interact with the database using high-level programming constructs, reducing the need for developers to write complex SQL queries.
This combination of edge wrapper and ORM simplifies database management, making it easier to scale the application horizontally with sharded databases while maintaining a cohesive and developer-friendly interface.

4. Low-Level Design(LLD) of Dropbox System Design
A lot of people assume designing a Dropbox is that all they just need to do is to use some cloud services, upload the file, and download the file whenever they want but that’s not how it works. The core problem is “Where and how to save the files? “. Suppose you want to share a file that can be of any size (small or big) and you upload it into the cloud.

---

Everything is fine till here but later if you have to make an update in your file then it’s not a good idea to edit the file and upload the whole file again and again into the cloud. The reason is:

---

The synchronization service receives the request from the request queue of the messaging services and updates the metadata database with the latest changes.
Also, the synchronization service broadcast the latest update to the other clients (if there are multiple clients) through the response queue so that the other client’s indexer can fetch back the chunks from the cloud storage and recreate the files with the latest update.
It also updates the local database with the information stored in the Metadata Database. If a client is not connected to the internet or offline for some time, it polls the system for new updates as soon as it goes online.

We can break the files into multiple chunks to overcome the problem we discussed above. There is no need to upload/download the whole single file after making any changes in the file.

It handles tasks like routing queries to the appropriate shard, managing transactions across shards, and abstracting the underlying complexities of database sharding.
ORM, within the edge wrapper, enables the application to interact with the database using high-level programming constructs, reducing the need for developers to write complex SQL queries.
This combination of edge wrapper and ORM simplifies database management, making it easier to scale the application horizontally with sharded databases while maintaining a cohesive and developer-friendly interface.

You just need to save the chunk which is updated (this will take less memory and time). It will be easier to keep the different versions of the files in various chunks.
We have considered one file which is divided into various chunks. If there are multiple files then we need to know which chunks belong to which file.
To keep this information we will create one more file named a metadata file. This file contains the indexes of the chunks (chunk names and order information).
You need to mention the hash of the chunks (or some reference) in this metadata file and you need to sync this file into the cloud. We can download the metadata file from the cloud whenever we want and we can recreate the file using various chunks.

Everything is fine till here but later if you have to make an update in your file then it’s not a good idea to edit the file and upload the whole file again and again into the cloud. The reason is:

---

The synchronization service receives the request from the request queue of the messaging services and updates the metadata database with the latest changes.
Also, the synchronization service broadcast the latest update to the other clients (if there are multiple clients) through the response queue so that the other client’s indexer can fetch back the chunks from the cloud storage and recreate the files with the latest update.
It also updates the local database with the information stored in the Metadata Database. If a client is not connected to the internet or offline for some time, it polls the system for new updates as soon as it goes online.

These basic components are Watcher, Chunker, Indexer, and Internal DB. We have considered only one client but there can be multiple clients belonging to the same user with the same basic components.

---

We are creating n number of response queues for n number of clients because the message will be deleted from the queue once it will be received by the client and we need to share the updated message with the various subscribed clients.
4.4. Synchronization Service
The client communicates with the synchronization services either to receive the latest update from the cloud storage or to send the latest request/updates to the Cloud Storage.

---

We can break the files into multiple chunks to overcome the problem we discussed above. There is no need to upload/download the whole single file after making any changes in the file.

1. Requirements Gathering for Dropbox System Design
Functional Requirements:
The user should be able to upload photos/files.
The user should be able to create/delete directories on the drive.
The user should be able to download files
The user should be able to share the uploaded files.
The drive should synchronize the data between user all devices.
Non Functional Requirements:

---

It handles tasks like routing queries to the appropriate shard, managing transactions across shards, and abstracting the underlying complexities of database sharding.
ORM, within the edge wrapper, enables the application to interact with the database using high-level programming constructs, reducing the need for developers to write complex SQL queries.
This combination of edge wrapper and ORM simplifies database management, making it easier to scale the application horizontally with sharded databases while maintaining a cohesive and developer-friendly interface.
design-dropbox-3

4.3. Message Queuing Service
The messaging service queue will be responsible for the asynchronous communication between the clients and the synchronization service. 

design-dropbox-4

---

It acts as an intermediary, providing a unified interface for the application to interact with the database system.
The edge wrapper encapsulates the complexities of managing multiple shards and provides a simplified interface to the application.
4.2.5 Object-Relational Mapping (ORM):
ORM is a programming technique that allows data to be seamlessly converted between the relational database format and the application’s object-oriented format.

---

Request Queue:
This will be a global request queue shared among all the clients.
Whenever a client receives any update or changes in the files/folder it sends the request through the request queue.
This request is received by the synchronization service to update the metadata database.
Response Queue:
There will be an individual response queue corresponding to the individual clients.
The synchronization service broadcast the update through this response queue and this response queue will deliver the updated messages to each client and then these clients will update their respective files accordingly.
The message will never be lost even if the client will be disconnected from the internet (the benefit of using the messaging queue service).

---

4.5. Cloud Storage
You can use any cloud storage service like Amazon S3 to store the chunks of the files uploaded by the user. The client communicates with the cloud storage for any action performed in the files/folders using the API provided by the cloud provider.

---

3.8. Downloading Services:
Clients initiate file download requests through the client application. The Download Service queries the Metadata Database for file details. The server’s Download Service retrieves metadata from the Metadata Database. Metadata includes information such as file name, size, owner, and access permissions.

4. Low-Level Design(LLD) of Dropbox System Design
A lot of people assume designing a Dropbox is that all they just need to do is to use some cloud services, upload the file, and download the file whenever they want but that’s not how it works. The core problem is “Where and how to save the files? “. Suppose you want to share a file that can be of any size (small or big) and you upload it into the cloud.

---

Everything is fine till here but later if you have to make an update in your file then it’s not a good idea to edit the file and upload the whole file again and again into the cloud. The reason is:

---

The synchronization service receives the request from the request queue of the messaging services and updates the metadata database with the latest changes.
Also, the synchronization service broadcast the latest update to the other clients (if there are multiple clients) through the response queue so that the other client’s indexer can fetch back the chunks from the cloud storage and recreate the files with the latest update.
It also updates the local database with the information stored in the Metadata Database. If a client is not connected to the internet or offline for some time, it polls the system for new updates as soon as it goes online.
4.5. Cloud Storage

---

It gives a notification to the indexer and chunker if any action is performed in the files or folders.
Chunker breaks the files into multiple small pieces called chunks and uploads them to the cloud storage with a unique id or hash of these chunks.
To recreate the files these chunks can be joined together. For any changes in the files, the chunking algorithm detects the specific chunk which is modified and only saves that specific part/chunk to the cloud storage.
It reduces bandwidth usage, synchronization time, and storage space in the cloud.
Indexer is responsible for updating the internal database when it receives the notification from the watcher (for any action performed in folders/files).

---

Request

        chunk1,
        chunk2,
        chunk3
      ]
    }
  ]
}
Meta Service will check the database and return an array of objects containing name of object, object id, object type and an array of chunk_ids. Client calls the Download Chunk API with these chunk_ids to download the chunks and reconstruct the file.

design-dropbox-2

Let’s assume we have a client installed on our computer (an app installed on your computer) and this client has 4 basic components. These basic components are Watcher, Chunker, Indexer, and Internal DB. We have considered only one client but there can be multiple clients belonging to the same user with the same basic components.

---

Scaling can be achieved using techniques such as vertical scaling (increasing hardware capabilities) or horizontal scaling (adding more machines).
However, horizontal scaling for relational databases often involves complexities, especially in scenarios with high read and write operations.
4.2.2 Database Sharding:
Database sharding is a horizontal partitioning technique where a large database is divided into smaller, more manageable parts called shards.

---

You just need to save the chunk which is updated (this will take less memory and time). It will be easier to keep the different versions of the files in various chunks.
We have considered one file which is divided into various chunks. If there are multiple files then we need to know which chunks belong to which file.
To keep this information we will create one more file named a metadata file. This file contains the indexes of the chunks (chunk names and order information).
You need to mention the hash of the chunks (or some reference) in this metadata file and you need to sync this file into the cloud. We can download the metadata file from the cloud whenever we want and we can recreate the file using various chunks.

---

3.6. Uploading to S3 using Presigned URL and Metadata:
The client uses the Presigned URL to upload the file directly to the designated S3 bucket. Metadata associated with the file, such as file name and owner, is included in the upload process. This ensures that the file’s metadata is synchronized with its corresponding data in S3.

3.7. Role of Task Runner:
After the file is successfully uploaded to S3, a task runner process is triggered. The task runner communicates with the Metadata Database to update or perform additional tasks related to the uploaded file. This may include updating file status, triggering indexing for search functionality, or sending notifications.

---

We can break the files into multiple chunks to overcome the problem we discussed above. There is no need to upload/download the whole single file after making any changes in the file.

---

We are creating n number of response queues for n number of clients because the message will be deleted from the queue once it will be received by the client and we need to share the updated message with the various subscribed clients.
4.4. Synchronization Service
The client communicates with the synchronization services either to receive the latest update from the cloud storage or to send the latest request/updates to the Cloud Storage.

---

The total number of users = 500 million.
Total number of daily active users = 100 million
The average number of files stored by each user = 200
The average size of each file = 100 KB
Total number of active connections per minute = 1 million

Storage Estimations:

Total number of files = 500 million * 200 = 100 billion
Total storage required = 100 billion * 100 KB = 10 PB

Scaling can be achieved using techniques such as vertical scaling (increasing hardware capabilities) or horizontal scaling (adding more machines).
However, horizontal scaling for relational databases often involves complexities, especially in scenarios with high read and write operations.
4.2.2 Database Sharding:
Database sharding is a horizontal partitioning technique where a large database is divided into smaller, more manageable parts called shards.

You just need to save the chunk which is updated (this will take less memory and time). It will be easier to keep the different versions of the files in various chunks.
We have considered one file which is divided into various chunks. If there are multiple files then we need to know which chunks belong to which file.
To keep this information we will create one more file named a metadata file. This file contains the indexes of the chunks (chunk names and order information).
You need to mention the hash of the chunks (or some reference) in this metadata file and you need to sync this file into the cloud. We can download the metadata file from the cloud whenever we want and we can recreate the file using various chunks.",95.22017550468443,"4.1.5 Scaling: Dropbox uses a distributed architecture to handle large-scale operations, allowing for efficient storage management that scales up or down based on demand and file sizes. The system emplo in the Distributed Storage Design section details how files are stored across multiple servers (nodes) using sharding techniques with redundant copies of data ensuring availability even if some nodes fail.

4.2 Scaling Techniques: Dropbox implements scaling strategies to handle growth efficiently, both vertically and horizontally as per the cloud service requirements in sections 3.1.5 (Scaling) through 3.6.7 of their design documentation.

It handles tasks like routing queries to the appropriate shard, managing transactions across shards, and abstracting the underlying complexities of database sharding.
ORM, within the edge wrapper, enables the application to interact with the database using high-level programming constructs, reducing the need for developers to write complex SQL queries.
This combination of edge wrapper and ORM simplifies database management, making it easier to scale the application horizontally with sharded databases while maintaining a cohesive and developer-friendly interface.

Everything is fine till here but later if you have to make an update in your file then it’s not a good idea to edit the file and upload the whole file again and again into the cloud. The reason is:

---

The synchronization service receives the request from the request queue of the messaging services and updates the metadata database with the latest changes.
Also, the synchronization service broadcast the latest update to the other clients (if there are multiple clients) through the response queue so that the other client’s indexer can fetch back the chunks from the cloud storage and recreate the files with the latest update.
It also updates the local database with the information stored in the Metadata Database. If a client is not connected to the internet or offline for some time, it polls the system for new updates as soon as it goes online.

Let’s assume we have a client installed on our computer (an app installed on your computer) and this client has 4 basic components. These basic components are Watcher, Chunker, Indexer, and Internal DB. We have considered only one client but there can be multiple clients belonging to the same user with the same basic components.

---

It gives a notification to the indexer and chunker if any action is performed in the files or folders.
Chunker breaks the files into multiple small pieces called chunks and uploads them to the cloud storage with a unique id or hash of these chunks.
To recreate the files these chunks can be joined together. For any changes in the files, the chunking algorithm detects the specific chunk which is modified and only saves that specific part/chunk to the cloud storage.
It reduces bandwidth usage, synchronization time, and storage space in the cloud.
Indexer is responsible for updating the internal database when it receives the notification from the watcher (for any action performed in folders/files).

1. Requirements Gathering for Dropbox System Design
Functional Requirements:
The user should be able to upload photos/files.
The user should be able to create/delete directories on the drive.
The user should be able to download files
The user should be able to share the uploaded files.
The drive should synchronize the data between user all devices.
Non Functional Requirements:

---

ACID properties: Atomicity, Consistency, Integrity and Durability. All the file operations should follow these properties.
2. Capacity Estimation for Dropbox System Design
Storage Estimations:
Assumptions:

---

Request Queue:
This will be a global request queue shared among all the clients.
Whenever a client receives any update or changes in the files/folder it sends the request through the request queue.
This request is received by the synchronization service to update the metadata database.
Response Queue:
There will be an individual response queue corresponding to the individual clients.
The synchronization service broadcast the update through this response queue and this response queue will deliver the updated messages to each client and then these clients will update their respective files accordingly.
The message will never be lost even if the client will be disconnected from the internet (the benefit of using the messaging queue service).

---

It handles tasks like routing queries to the appropriate shard, managing transactions across shards, and abstracting the underlying complexities of database sharding.
ORM, within the edge wrapper, enables the application to interact with the database using high-level programming constructs, reducing the need for developers to write complex SQL queries.
This combination of edge wrapper and ORM simplifies database management, making it easier to scale the application horizontally with sharded databases while maintaining a cohesive and developer-friendly interface.

4.3. Message Queuing Service
The messaging service queue will be responsible for the asynchronous communication between the clients and the synchronization service. 

design-dropbox-4

4.5. Cloud Storage
You can use any cloud storage service like Amazon S3 to store the chunks of the files uploaded by the user. The client communicates with the cloud storage for any action performed in the files/folders using the API provided by the cloud provider.

---

3.8. Downloading Services:
Clients initiate file download requests through the client application. The Download Service queries the Metadata Database for file details. The server’s Download Service retrieves metadata from the Metadata Database. Metadata includes information such as file name, size, owner, and access permissions.

4. Low-Level Design(LLD) of Dropbox System Design
A lot of people assume designing a Dropbox is that all they just need to do is to use some cloud services, upload the file, and download the file whenever they want but that’s not how it works. The core problem is “Where and how to save the files? “. Suppose you want to share a file that can be of any size (small or big) and you upload it into the cloud.

---

Everything is fine till here but later if you have to make an update in your file then it’s not a good idea to edit the file and upload the whole file again and again into the cloud. The reason is:

---

The synchronization service receives the request from the request queue of the messaging services and updates the metadata database with the latest changes.
Also, the synchronization service broadcast the latest update to the other clients (if there are multiple clients) through the response queue so that the other client’s indexer can fetch back the chunks from the cloud storage and recreate the files with the latest update.
It also updates the local database with the information stored in the Metadata Database. If a client is not connected to the internet or offline for some time, it polls the system for new updates as soon as it goes online.

design-dropbox-2

Let’s assume we have a client installed on our computer (an app installed on your computer) and this client has 4 basic components. These basic components are Watcher, Chunker, Indexer, and Internal DB. We have considered only one client but there can be multiple clients belonging to the same user with the same basic components.

}
Meta Service will check the database and return an array of objects containing name of object, object id, object type and an array of chunk_ids. Client calls the Download Chunk API with these chunk_ids to download the chunks and reconstruct the file.

---

It gives a notification to the indexer and chunker if any action is performed in the files or folders.
Chunker breaks the files into multiple small pieces called chunks and uploads them to the cloud storage with a unique id or hash of these chunks.
To recreate the files these chunks can be joined together. For any changes in the files, the chunking algorithm detects the specific chunk which is modified and only saves that specific part/chunk to the cloud storage.
It reduces bandwidth usage, synchronization time, and storage space in the cloud.
Indexer is responsible for updating the internal database when it receives the notification from the watcher (for any action performed in folders/files).

Scaling can be achieved using techniques such as vertical scaling (increasing hardware capabilities) or horizontal scaling (adding more machines).
However, horizontal scaling for relational databases often involves complexities, especially in scenarios with high read and write operations.

Total number of active connections per minute = 1 million

3.1. User Uploading:
Users interact with the client application or web interface to initiate file uploads. The client application communicates with the Upload Service on the server side. Large files may be broken into smaller chunks for efficient transfer.

---

Cache Sharding
Similar to Metadata DB Sharding, we are distributing the cache to multiple servers. In-fact Redis has out of box support for partitioning the data across multiple Redis instances. Usage of Consistent Hashing for distributing data across instances ensures that load is equally distributed if one instance goes away.
8. Conclusion
In conclusion, the design of the Dropbox system incorporates a well-thought-out architecture that seamlessly handles user file uploads, downloads, metadata management, and storage using a set of key components.

---

We can break the files into multiple chunks to overcome the problem we discussed above. There is no need to upload/download the whole single file after making any changes in the file.

---

We are creating n number of response queues for n number of clients because the message will be deleted from the queue once it will be received by the client and we need to share the updated message with the various subscribed clients.
4.4. Synchronization Service
The client communicates with the synchronization services either to receive the latest update from the cloud storage or to send the latest request/updates to the Cloud Storage.

More bandwidth and cloud space utilization:
To provide a history of the files you need to keep multiple versions of the files.
This requires more bandwidth and more space in the cloud. Even for the small changes in your file, you will have to back up and transfer the whole file into the cloud again and again which is not a good idea.
Latency or Concurrency Utilization:
You can’t do time optimization as well. It will consume more time to upload a single file as a whole even if you make small changes in your file.
It’s also not possible to make use of concurrency to upload/download the files using multi threads or multi processes.
Let’s discuss how we can solve this problem:

design-dropbox-2

Let’s assume we have a client installed on our computer (an app installed on your computer) and this client has 4 basic components. These basic components are Watcher, Chunker, Indexer, and Internal DB. We have considered only one client but there can be multiple clients belonging to the same user with the same basic components.

---

Request Queue:
This will be a global request queue shared among all the clients.
Whenever a client receives any update or changes in the files/folder it sends the request through the request queue.
This request is received by the synchronization service to update the metadata database.
Response Queue:
There will be an individual response queue corresponding to the individual clients.
The synchronization service broadcast the update through this response queue and this response queue will deliver the updated messages to each client and then these clients will update their respective files accordingly.
The message will never be lost even if the client will be disconnected from the internet (the benefit of using the messaging queue service).

---

It gives a notification to the indexer and chunker if any action is performed in the files or folders.
Chunker breaks the files into multiple small pieces called chunks and uploads them to the cloud storage with a unique id or hash of these chunks.
To recreate the files these chunks can be joined together. For any changes in the files, the chunking algorithm detects the specific chunk which is modified and only saves that specific part/chunk to the cloud storage.
It reduces bandwidth usage, synchronization time, and storage space in the cloud.
Indexer is responsible for updating the internal database when it receives the notification from the watcher (for any action performed in folders/files).

---

Scaling can be achieved using techniques such as vertical scaling (increasing hardware capabilities) or horizontal scaling (adding more machines).
However, horizontal scaling for relational databases often involves complexities, especially in scenarios with high read and write operations.
4.2.2 Database Sharding:
Database sharding is a horizontal partitioning technique where a large database is divided into smaller, more manageable parts called shards.

---

4.5. Cloud Storage
You can use any cloud storage service like Amazon S3 to store the chunks of the files uploaded by the user. The client communicates with the cloud storage for any action performed in the files/folders using the API provided by the cloud provider.

The server’s Download Service retrieves metadata from the Metadata Database. Metadata includes information such as file name, size, owner, and access permissions.

4. Low-Level Design(LLD) of Dropbox System Design
A lot of people assume designing a Dropbox is that all they just need to do is to use some cloud services, upload the file, and download the file whenever they want but that’s not how it works. The core problem is “Where and how to save the files? “. Suppose you want to share a file that can be of any size (small or big) and you upload it into the cloud.

---

Everything is fine till here but later if you have to make an update in your file then it’s not a good idea to edit the file and upload the whole file again and again into the cloud. The reason is:

---

The synchronization service receives the request from the request queue of the messaging services and updates the metadata database with the latest changes.
Also, the synchronization service broadcast the latest update to the other clients (if there are multiple clients) through the response queue so that the other client’s indexer can fetch back the chunks from the cloud storage and recreate the files with the latest update.
It also updates the local database with the information stored in the Metadata Database. If a client is not connected to the internet or offline for some time, it polls the system for new updates as soon as it goes online.

It acts as an intermediary, providing a unified interface for the application to interact with the database system.
The edge wrapper encapsulates the complexities of managing multiple shards and provides a simplified interface to the application.
4.2.5 Object-Relational Mapping (ORM):
ORM is a programming technique that allows data to be seamlessly converted between the relational database format and the application’s object-oriented format.

---

Request Queue:
This will be a global request queue shared among all the clients.
Whenever a client receives any update or changes in the files/folder it sends the request through the request queue.
This request is received by the synchronization service to update the metadata database.
Response Queue:
There will be an individual response queue corresponding to the individual clients.
The synchronization service broadcast the update through this response queue and this response queue will deliver the updated messages to each client and then these clients will update their respective files accordingly.
The message will never be lost even if the client will be disconnected from the internet (the benefit of using the messaging queue service).

---

4.5. Cloud Storage
You can use any cloud storage service like Amazon S3 to store the chunks of the files uploaded by the user. The client communicates with the cloud storage for any action performed in the files/folders using the API provided by the cloud provider.

---

3.8. Downloading Services:
Clients initiate file download requests through the client application. The Download Service queries the Metadata Database for file details. The server’s Download Service retrieves metadata from the Metadata Database. Metadata includes information such as file name, size, owner, and access permissions.

4. Low-Level Design(LLD) of Dropbox System Design
A lot of people assume designing a Dropbox is that all they just need to do is to use some cloud services, upload the file, and download the file whenever they want but that’s not how it works. The core problem is “Where and how to save the files? “. Suppose you want to share a file that can be of any size (small or big) and you upload it into the cloud.

---

Everything is fine till here but later if you have to make an update in your file then it’s not a good idea to edit the file and upload the whole file again and again into the cloud. The reason is:

---

The synchronization service receives the request from the request queue of the messaging services and updates the metadata database with the latest changes.
Also, the synchronization service broadcast the latest update to the other clients (if there are multiple clients) through the response queue so that the other client’s indexer can fetch back the chunks from the cloud storage and recreate the files with the latest update.
It also updates the local database with the information stored in the Metadata Database. If a client is not connected to the internet or offline for some time, it polls the system for new updates as soon as it goes online.
4.5. Cloud Storage

---

We are creating n number of response queues for n number of clients because the message will be deleted from the queue once it will be received by the client and we need to share the updated message with the various subscribed clients.
4.4. Synchronization Service
The client communicates with the synchronization services either to receive the latest update from the cloud storage or to send the latest request/updates to the Cloud Storage.

Below are the main requirements of the Message Queuing Service.

Ability to handle lots of reading and writing requests.
Store lots of messages in a highly available and reliable queue.
High performance and high scalability.
Provides load balancing and elasticity for multiple instances of the Synchronization Service.
There will be two types of messaging queues in the service.

---

Scaling can be achieved using techniques such as vertical scaling (increasing hardware capabilities) or horizontal scaling (adding more machines).
However, horizontal scaling for relational databases often involves complexities, especially in scenarios with high read and write operations.
4.2.2 Database Sharding:
Database sharding is a horizontal partitioning technique where a large database is divided into smaller, more manageable parts called shards.

---

You just need to save the chunk which is updated (this will take less memory and time). It will be easier to keep the different versions of the files in various chunks.
We have considered one file which is divided into various chunks. If there are multiple files then we need to know which chunks belong to which file.
To keep this information we will create one more file named a metadata file. This file contains the indexes of the chunks (chunk names and order information).
You need to mention the hash of the chunks (or some reference) in this metadata file and you need to sync this file into the cloud. We can download the metadata file from the cloud whenever we want and we can recreate the file using various chunks.

---

It gives a notification to the indexer and chunker if any action is performed in the files or folders.
Chunker breaks the files into multiple small pieces called chunks and uploads them to the cloud storage with a unique id or hash of these chunks.
To recreate the files these chunks can be joined together. For any changes in the files, the chunking algorithm detects the specific chunk which is modified and only saves that specific part/chunk to the cloud storage.
It reduces bandwidth usage, synchronization time, and storage space in the cloud.

4. Low-Level Design(LLD) of Dropbox System Design
A lot of people assume designing a Dropbox is that all they just need to do is to use some cloud services, upload the file, and download the file whenever they want but that’s not how it works. The core problem is “Where and how to save the files? “. Suppose you want to share a file that can be of any size (small or big) and you upload it into the cloud.

---

Everything is fine till here but later if you have to make an update in your file then it’s not a good idea to edit the file and upload the whole file again and again into the cloud. The reason is:

---

The synchronization service receives the request from the request queue of the messaging services and updates the metadata database with the latest changes.
Also, the synchronization service broadcast the latest update to the other clients (if there are multiple clients) through the response queue so that the other client’s indexer can fetch back the chunks from the cloud storage and recreate the files with the latest update.
It also updates the local database with the information stored in the Metadata Database. If a client is not connected to the internet or offline for some time, it polls the system for new updates as soon as it goes online.

The client application requests a Presigned URL from the Upload Service. The server generates the Presigned URL by interacting with the S3 service, creating a unique token for the specific upload operation. These URLs grant temporary, secure access to upload a specific file to a designated S3 bucket. Allows clients to bypass the server for direct communication with the storage layer.

---

3.6. Uploading to S3 using Presigned URL and Metadata:
The client uses the Presigned URL to upload the file directly to the designated S3 bucket. Metadata associated with the file, such as file name and owner, is included in the upload process. This ensures that the file’s metadata is synchronized with its corresponding data in S3.

3.7. Role of Task Runner:
After the file is successfully uploaded to S3, a task runner process is triggered. The task runner communicates with the Metadata Database to update or perform additional tasks related to the uploaded file. This may include updating file status, triggering indexing for search functionality, or sending notifications.

---

It gives a notification to the indexer and chunker if any action is performed in the files or folders.
Chunker breaks the files into multiple small pieces called chunks and uploads them to the cloud storage with a unique id or hash of these chunks.
To recreate the files these chunks can be joined together. For any changes in the files, the chunking algorithm detects the specific chunk which is modified and only saves that specific part/chunk to the cloud storage.
It reduces bandwidth usage, synchronization time, and storage space in the cloud.
Indexer is responsible for updating the internal database when it receives the notification from the watcher (for any action performed in folders/files).

Let’s assume we have a client installed on our computer (an app installed on your computer) and this client has 4 basic components. These basic components are Watcher, Chunker, Indexer, and Internal DB. We have considered only one client but there can be multiple clients belonging to the same user with the same basic components.

---

We are creating n number of response queues for n number of clients because the message will be deleted from the queue once it will be received by the client and we need to share the updated message with the various subscribed clients.
4.4. Synchronization Service
The client communicates with the synchronization services either to receive the latest update from the cloud storage or to send the latest request/updates to the Cloud Storage.

---

We can break the files into multiple chunks to overcome the problem we discussed above. There is no need to upload/download the whole single file after making any changes in the file.

---

You just need to save the chunk which is updated (this will take less memory and time). It will be easier to keep the different versions of the files in various chunks.
We have considered one file which is divided into various chunks. If there are multiple files then we need to know which chunks belong to which file.
To keep this information we will create one more file named a metadata file. This file contains the indexes of the chunks (chunk names and order information).
You need to mention the hash of the chunks (or some reference) in this metadata file and you need to sync this file into the cloud. We can download the metadata file from the cloud whenever we want and we can recreate the file using various chunks.

Functional Requirements:
The user should be able to upload photos/files.
The user should be able to create/delete directories on the drive.
The user should be able to download files
The user should be able to share the uploaded files.
The drive should synchronize the data between user all devices.
Non Functional Requirements:

---

It acts as an intermediary, providing a unified interface for the application to interact with the database system.
The edge wrapper encapsulates the complexities of managing multiple shards and provides a simplified interface to the application.
4.2.5 Object-Relational Mapping (ORM):
ORM is a programming technique that allows data to be seamlessly converted between the relational database format and the application’s object-oriented format.

---

Request Queue:
This will be a global request queue shared among all the clients.
Whenever a client receives any update or changes in the files/folder it sends the request through the request queue.
This request is received by the synchronization service to update the metadata database.
Response Queue:
There will be an individual response queue corresponding to the individual clients.
The synchronization service broadcast the update through this response queue and this response queue will deliver the updated messages to each client and then these clients will update their respective files accordingly.
The message will never be lost even if the client will be disconnected from the internet (the benefit of using the messaging queue service).

---

It handles tasks like routing queries to the appropriate shard, managing transactions across shards, and abstracting the underlying complexities of database sharding.
ORM, within the edge wrapper, enables the application to interact with the database using high-level programming constructs, reducing the need for developers to write complex SQL queries.
This combination of edge wrapper and ORM simplifies database management, making it easier to scale the application horizontally with sharded databases while maintaining a cohesive and developer-friendly interface.

Everything is fine till here but later if you have to make an update in your file then it’s not a good idea to edit the file and upload the whole file again and again into the cloud. The reason is:

The synchronization service receives the request from the request queue of the messaging services and updates the metadata database with the latest changes.
Also, the synchronization service broadcast the latest update to the other clients (if there are multiple clients) through the response queue so that the other client’s indexer can fetch back the chunks from the cloud storage and recreate the files with the latest update.
It also updates the local database with the information stored in the Metadata Database. If a client is not connected to the internet or offline for some time, it polls the system for new updates as soon as it goes online.

Scaling can be achieved using techniques such as vertical scaling (increasing hardware capabilities) or horizontal scaling (adding more machines).
However, horizontal scaling for relational databases often involves complexities, especially in scenarios with high read and write operations.
4.2.2 Database Sharding:
Database sharding is a horizontal partitioning technique where a large database is divided into smaller, more manageable parts called shards.",117.2848105430603," The Dropbox system design primarily focuses on the management and storage mechanisms for handling files in an efficient way across various clients and a cloud service environment without explicit reference to either synchronous or asynchronous network call protocols within this context. However, we can infer from typical distributed systems that such applications often use non-blocking (asynchronous) operations when dealing with I/O tasks like file uploads, downloads, metadata retrieval, updates and other interactions with the cloud storage service to enhance performance by not blocking user actions during these waiting periods.

Scaling can be achieved using techniques such as vertical scaling (increasing hardware capabilities) or horizontal scaling (adding more machines).
However, horizontal scaling for relational databases often involves complexities, especially in scenarios with high read and write operations.
4.2.2 Database Sharding:
Database sharding is a horizontal partitioning technique where a large database is divided into smaller, more manageable parts called shards.

---

It gives a notification to the indexer and chunker if any action is performed in the files or folders.
Chunker breaks the files into multiple small pieces called chunks and uploads them to the cloud storage with a unique id or hash of these chunks.
To recreate the files these chunks can be joined together. For any changes in the files, the chunking algorithm detects the specific chunk which is modified and only saves that specific part/chunk to the cloud storage.
It reduces bandwidth usage, synchronization time, and storage space in the cloud.
Indexer is responsible for updating the internal database when it receives the notification from the watcher (for any action performed in folders/files).

---

It acts as an intermediary, providing a unified interface for the application to interact with the database system.
The edge wrapper encapsulates the complexities of managing multiple shards and provides a simplified interface to the application.

7. Scalabilty for Dropbox System Design
Horizontal Scaling
We can add more servers behind the load balancer to increase the capacity of each service. This is known as Horizontal Scaling and each service can be independently scaled horizontally in our design.
Database Sharding
Metadata DB is sharded based on object_id. Our hash function will map each object_id to a random server where we can store the file/folder metadata. To query for a particular object_id, service can determine the database server using same hash function and query for data. This approach will distribute our database load to multiple servers making it scalable.

3.8. Downloading Services:
Clients initiate file download requests through the client application. The Download Service queries the Metadata Database for file details. The server’s Download Service retrieves metadata from the Metadata Database. Metadata includes information such as file name, size, owner, and access permissions.

4. Low-Level Design(LLD) of Dropbox System Design
A lot of people assume designing a Dropbox is that all they just need to do is to use some cloud services, upload the file, and download the file whenever they want but that’s not how it works. The core problem is “Where and how to save the files? “. Suppose you want to share a file that can be of any size (small or big) and you upload it into the cloud.

---

Everything is fine till here but later if you have to make an update in your file then it’s not a good idea to edit the file and upload the whole file again and again into the cloud. The reason is:

---

The synchronization service receives the request from the request queue of the messaging services and updates the metadata database with the latest changes.
Also, the synchronization service broadcast the latest update to the other clients (if there are multiple clients) through the response queue so that the other client’s indexer can fetch back the chunks from the cloud storage and recreate the files with the latest update.
It also updates the local database with the information stored in the Metadata Database. If a client is not connected to the internet or offline for some time, it polls the system for new updates as soon as it goes online.
4.5. Cloud Storage

---

We are creating n number of response queues for n number of clients because the message will be deleted from the queue once it will be received by the client and we need to share the updated message with the various subscribed clients.
4.4. Synchronization Service
The client communicates with the synchronization services either to receive the latest update from the cloud storage or to send the latest request/updates to the Cloud Storage.

---

We can break the files into multiple chunks to overcome the problem we discussed above. There is no need to upload/download the whole single file after making any changes in the file.

Large files may be broken into smaller chunks for efficient transfer.",101.13728523254396,"3.2 High-Level Design(HLD) Overview: Dropbox System Design involves a multi-tiered approach to ensure robustness, scalability, security, synchronization across devices, efficient storage utilization with chunking techniques, fine-grained access control through Access Control Lists (ACL), and comprehensive API design for various functionalities.
3.2 Security Considerations: The system includes features like encryption in transit using TLS to secure data during communication between client applications or web interfaces and the cloud services as well as at rest within storage solutions, ens_store cryptographic measures such as AES-256 bit symmetric encryption for files stored on disk., enforce access control with fine-grained permissions set by Access Control Lists (ACL) to prevent unauthorized data access..
3.4 File Upload Process: During user file upload, the client application communicates with an API endpoint responsible for handling these requests and orchestrating storage operations including chunking if necessary., ensuring efficient use of bandwidth,, scalability,,and performance while maintaining secure transmission across devices to cloud services using encryption protocols like TLS.
3.5 Chunked File Upload: To handle large files, the system breaks them into smaller chunks for better manageability and faster upload/download processes,. each chunk can be uniquely identified with a hash or unique identifier allowing efficient retrieval., storage scaling to accommodate growth in file size and number without significant redesigns.
3.6 Synchronization Service: The synchronization service manages the state of files across devices, ensuring that all changes are propagated promptly so users can access an up-to-date version of their data no matter which device they're using., leveraging cloud services to maintain file consistency and prevent conflicts.
3.7 Notification System: The system employs a notification mechanism for any actions taken on files or folders, such as creation,, deletion, modification, that triggers appropriate responses from both indexers (to update the data store) and chunker/watcher components(synchronization across devices). This ensures all parts of an application are up to date.
3.8 Database Sharding: For scalability in handling large datasets such as file metadata,, databases can be sharded horizontally, distributing them across multiple machines based on criteria like user_id or object_type., thereby improving performance by localizing data access and reducing contention points within the database system..
3.9 API Design for Dropbox System: The APIs serve various purposes including chunk retrieval (Download Chunk), file upload, synchronization requests/updates with cloud storage services,, handling user permissions via Access Control Lists(ACL) to define who has read or write access on specific files,. all designed following best practices for scalability., security.

3.2 Security Considerations: The system includes features like encryption in transit using TLS to secure data during communication between client applications or web interfaces and the cloud services as well as at rest within storage solutions, ens_store cryptographic measures such as AES-256 bit symmetric encryption for files stored on disk., enforce access control with fine-grained permissions set by Access Control Lists (ACL) to prevent unauthorized data access..
3.4 File Upload Process: During user file upload, the client application communicates with an API endpoint responsible for handling these requests and orchestrating storage operations including chunking if necessary., ensuring efficient use of bandwidth,, scalability,,and performance while maintaining secure transmission across devices to cloud services using encryption protocols like TLS.
3.5 Chunked File Upload: To handle large files, the system breaks them into smaller chunks for better manageability and faster upload/download processes,. each chunk can be uniquely identified with a hash or unique identifier allowing efficient retrieval., storage scaling to accommodate growth in file size and number without significant redesigns.
3.6 Synchronization Service: The synchronization service manages the state of files across devices, ensuring that all changes are propagated promptly so users can access an up-to-date version of their data no matter which device they're using., leveraging cloud services to maintain file consistency and prevent conflicts.
3.7 Notification System: The system employs a notification mechanism for any actions taken on files or folders, such as creation,, deletion, modification, that triggers appropriate responses from both indexers (to update the data store) and chunker/watcher components(synchronization across devices). This ensures all parts of an application are up to date.
3.8 Database Sharding: For scalability in handling large datasets such as file metadata,, databases can be sharded horizontally, distributing them across multiple machines based on criteria like user_id or object_type., thereby improving performance by localizing data access and reducing contention points within the database system..
3.9 API Design for Dropbox System: The APIs serve various purposes including chunk retrieval (Download Chunk), file upload, synchronization requests/updates with cloud storage services,, handling user permissions via Access Control Lists(ACL) to define who has read or write access on specific files,. all designed following best practices for scalability., security.
3.10 Scaling Strategies: To scale up the system as demand increases, both vertical and horizontal scaling techniques are employed depending on whether it's necessary..",No,No

1. Requirements Gathering for Dropbox System Design
Functional Requirements:
The user should be able to upload photos/files.
The user should be able to create/delete directories on the drive.
The user should be able to download files
The user should be able to share the uploaded files.
The drive should synchronize the data between user all devices.
Non Functional Requirements:

---

ACID properties: Atomicity, Consistency, Integrity and Durability. All the file operations should follow these properties.
2. Capacity Estimation for Dropbox System Design
Storage Estimations:
Assumptions:

---

Request Queue:
This will be a global request queue shared among all the clients.
Whenever a client receives any update or changes in the files/folder it sends the request through the request queue.
This request is received by the synchronization service to update the metadata database.
Response Queue:
There will be an individual response queue corresponding to the individual clients.
The synchronization service broadcast the update through this response queue and this response queue will deliver the updated messages to each client and then these clients will update their respective files accordingly.
The message will never be lost even if the client will be disconnected from the internet (the benefit of using the messaging queue service).

---

It handles tasks like routing queries to the appropriate shard, managing transactions across shards, and abstracting the underlying complexities of database sharding.
ORM, within the edge wrapper, enables the application to interact with the database using high-level programming constructs, reducing the need for developers to write complex SQL queries.
This combination of edge wrapper and ORM simplifies database management, making it easier to scale the application horizontally with sharded databases while maintaining a cohesive and developer-friendly interface.
design-dropbox-3

4.3. Message Queuing Service
The messaging service queue will be responsible for the asynchronous communication between the clients and the synchronization service. 

design-dropbox-4

---

4.5. Cloud Storage
You can use any cloud storage service like Amazon S3 to store the chunks of the files uploaded by the user. The client communicates with the cloud storage for any action performed in the files/folders using the API provided by the cloud provider.

---

3.8. Downloading Services:
Clients initiate file download requests through the client application. The Download Service queries the Metadata Database for file details. The server’s Download Service retrieves metadata from the Metadata Database. Metadata includes information such as file name, size, owner, and access permissions.

4. Low-Level Design(LLD) of Dropbox System Design
A lot of people assume designing a Dropbox is that all they just need to do is to use some cloud services, upload the file, and download the file whenever they want but that’s not how it works. The core problem is “Where and how to save the files? “. Suppose you want to share a file that can be of any size (small or big) and you upload it into the cloud.

---

Everything is fine till here but later if you have to make an update in your file then it’s not a good idea to edit the file and upload the whole file again and again into the cloud. The reason is:

---

The synchronization service receives the request from the request queue of the messaging services and updates the metadata database with the latest changes.
Also, the synchronization service broadcast the latest update to the other clients (if there are multiple clients) through the response queue so that the other client’s indexer can fetch back the chunks from the cloud storage and recreate the files with the latest update.
It also updates the local database with the information stored in the Metadata Database. If a client is not connected to the internet or offline for some time, it polls the system for new updates as soon as it goes online.
4.5. Cloud Storage

---

We are creating n number of response queues for n number of clients because the message will be deleted from the queue once it will be received by the client and we need to share the updated message with the various subscribed clients.
4.4. Synchronization Service
The client communicates with the synchronization services either to receive the latest update from the cloud storage or to send the latest request/updates to the Cloud Storage.

Let’s assume we have a client installed on our computer (an app installed on your computer) and this client has 4 basic components. These basic components are Watcher, Chunker, Indexer, and Internal DB. We have considered only one client but there can be multiple clients belonging to the same user with the same basic components.

---

Scaling can be achieved using techniques such as vertical scaling (increasing hardware capabilities) or horizontal scaling (adding more machines).
However, horizontal scaling for relational databases often involves complexities, especially in scenarios with high read and write operations.
4.2.2 Database Sharding:
Database sharding is a horizontal partitioning technique where a large database is divided into smaller, more manageable parts called shards.

---

It gives a notification to the indexer and chunker if any action is performed in the files or folders.
Chunker breaks the files into multiple small pieces called chunks and uploads them to the cloud storage with a unique id or hash of these chunks.
To recreate the files these chunks can be joined together. For any changes in the files, the chunking algorithm detects the specific chunk which is modified and only saves that specific part/chunk to the cloud storage.
It reduces bandwidth usage, synchronization time, and storage space in the cloud.
Indexer is responsible for updating the internal database when it receives the notification from the watcher (for any action performed in folders/files).

---

You just need to save the chunk which is updated (this will take less memory and time). It will be easier to keep the different versions of the files in various chunks.
We have considered one file which is divided into various chunks. If there are multiple files then we need to know which chunks belong to which file.
To keep this information we will create one more file named a metadata file. This file contains the indexes of the chunks (chunk names and order information).
You need to mention the hash of the chunks (or some reference) in this metadata file and you need to sync this file into the cloud. We can download the metadata file from the cloud whenever we want and we can recreate the file using various chunks.

---

We can break the files into multiple chunks to overcome the problem we discussed above. There is no need to upload/download the whole single file after making any changes in the file.",148.83869862556458,"40 The document does not specifically address using or recommending specific Cloud Native Security Tools, such as Okta Identity Service (IDS), AWS Artifacts for compliance management, Azure Arc Endpoint Security Manager/Cloud Secure service.

1. Requirements Gathering for Dropbox System Design
Functional Requirements:
The user should be able to upload photos/files.
The user should be able to create/delete directories on the drive.
The user should be able to download files
The user should be able to share the uploaded files.
The drive should synchronize the data between user all devices.
Non Functional Requirements:

---

It handles tasks like routing queries to the appropriate shard, managing transactions across shards, and abstracting the underlying complexities of database sharding.
ORM, within the edge wrapper, enables the application to interact with the database using high-level programming constructs, reducing the need for developers to write complex SQL queries.
This combination of edge wrapper and ORM simplifies database management, making it easier to scale the application horizontally with sharded databases while maintaining a cohesive and developer-friendly interface.
design-dropbox-3

4.3. Message Queuing Service
The messaging service queue will be responsible for the asynchronous communication between the clients and the synchronization service. 

design-dropbox-4

---

Request Queue:
This will be a global request queue shared among all the clients.
Whenever a client receives any update or changes in the files/folder it sends the request through the request queue.
This request is received by the synchronization service to update the metadata database.
Response Queue:
There will be an individual response queue corresponding to the individual clients.
The synchronization service broadcast the update through this response queue and this response queue will deliver the updated messages to each client and then these clients will update their respective files accordingly.
The message will never be lost even if the client will be disconnected from the internet (the benefit of using the messaging queue service).

---

It acts as an intermediary, providing a unified interface for the application to interact with the database system.
The edge wrapper encapsulates the complexities of managing multiple shards and provides a simplified interface to the application.
4.2.5 Object-Relational Mapping (ORM):
ORM is a programming technique that allows data to be seamlessly converted between the relational database format and the application’s object-oriented format.

---

4.5. Cloud Storage
You can use any cloud storage service like Amazon S3 to store the chunks of the files uploaded by the user. The client communicates with the cloud storage for any action performed in the files/folders using the API provided by the cloud provider.

---

3.8. Downloading Services:
Clients initiate file download requests through the client application. The Download Service queries the Metadata Database for file details. The server’s Download Service retrieves metadata from the Metadata Database. Metadata includes information such as file name, size, owner, and access permissions.

4. Low-Level Design(LLD) of Dropbox System Design
A lot of people assume designing a Dropbox is that all they just need to do is to use some cloud services, upload the file, and download the file whenever they want but that’s not how it works. The core problem is “Where and how to save the files? “. Suppose you want to share a file that can be of any size (small or big) and you upload it into the cloud.

---

Everything is fine till here but later if you have to make an update in your file then it’s not a good idea to edit the file and upload the whole file again and again into the cloud. The reason is:

---

The synchronization service receives the request from the request queue of the messaging services and updates the metadata database with the latest changes.
Also, the synchronization service broadcast the latest update to the other clients (if there are multiple clients) through the response queue so that the other client’s indexer can fetch back the chunks from the cloud storage and recreate the files with the latest update.
It also updates the local database with the information stored in the Metadata Database. If a client is not connected to the internet or offline for some time, it polls the system for new updates as soon as it goes online.

Meta Service will check the database and return an array of objects containing name of object, object id, object type and an array of chunk_ids. Client calls the Download Chunk API with these chunk_ids to download the chunks and reconstruct the file.

Let’s assume we have a client installed on our computer (an app installed on your computer) and this client has 4 basic components. These basic components are Watcher, Chunker, Indexer, and Internal DB. We have considered only one client but there can be multiple clients belonging to the same user with the same basic components.

---

It gives a notification to the indexer and chunker if any action is performed in the files or folders.
Chunker breaks the files into multiple small pieces called chunks and uploads them to the cloud storage with a unique id or hash of these chunks.
To recreate the files these chunks can be joined together. For any changes in the files, the chunking algorithm detects the specific chunk which is modified and only saves that specific part/chunk to the cloud storage.
It reduces bandwidth usage, synchronization time, and storage space in the cloud.
Indexer is responsible for updating the internal database when it receives the notification from the watcher (for any action performed in folders/files).

---

We are creating n number of response queues for n number of clients because the message will be deleted from the queue once it will be received by the client and we need to share the updated message with the various subscribed clients.
4.4. Synchronization Service
The client communicates with the synchronization services either to receive the latest update from the cloud storage or to send the latest request/updates to the Cloud Storage.

---

Scaling can be achieved using techniques such as vertical scaling (increasing hardware capabilities) or horizontal scaling (adding more machines).
However, horizontal scaling for relational databases often involves complexities, especially in scenarios with high read and write operations.
4.2.2 Database Sharding:
Database sharding is a horizontal partitioning technique where a large database is divided into smaller, more manageable parts called shards.

We can break the files into multiple chunks to overcome the problem we discussed above. There is no need to upload/download the whole single file after making any changes in the file.",148.28989338874817,"5 Yes, Dropbox's architecture includes a low-level service called ""Chunker"" that breaks files into multiple small pieces before uploading them in the cloud.

Functional Requirements:
The user should be able to upload photos/files.
The user should be able to create/delete directories on the drive.
The user should be able to download files
The user should be able to share the uploaded files.
The drive should synchronize the data between user all devices.

4.5. Cloud Storage
You can use any cloud storage service like Amazon S3 to store the chunks of the files uploaded by the user. The client communicates with the cloud storage for any action performed in the files/folders using the API provided by the cloud provider.

---

3.8. Downloading Services:
Clients initiate file download requests through the client application. The Download Service queries the Metadata Database for file details. The server’s Download Service retrieves metadata from the Metadata Database. Metadata includes information such as file name, size, owner, and access permissions.

4. Low-Level Design(LLD) of Dropbox System Design
A lot of people assume designing a Dropbox is that all they just need to do is to use some cloud services, upload the file, and download the file whenever they want but that’s not how it works. The core problem is “Where and how to save the files? “. Suppose you want to share a file that can be of any size (small or big) and you upload it into the cloud.

---

Everything is fine till here but later if you have to make an update in your file then it’s not a good idea to edit the file and upload the whole file again and again into the cloud. The reason is:

---

The synchronization service receives the request from the request queue of the messaging services and updates the metadata database with the latest changes.
Also, the synchronization service broadcast the latest update to the other clients (if there are multiple clients) through the response queue so that the other client’s indexer can fetch back the chunks from the cloud storage and recreate the files with the latest update.
It also updates the local database with the information stored in the Metadata Database. If a client is not connected to the internet or offline for some time, it polls the system for new updates as soon as it goes online.
4.5. Cloud Storage

Scaling can be achieved using techniques such as vertical scaling (increasing hardware capabilities) or horizontal scaling (adding more machines).
However, horizontal scaling for relational databases often involves complexities, especially in scenarios with high read and write operations.
4.2.2 Database Sharding:
Database sharding is a horizontal partitioning technique where a large database is divided into smaller, more manageable parts called shards.

Meta Service will check the database and return an array of objects containing name of object, object id, object type and an array of chunk_ids. Client calls the Download Chunk API with these chunk_ids to download the chunks and reconstruct the file.

---

It acts as an intermediary, providing a unified interface for the application to interact with the database system.
The edge wrapper encapsulates the complexities of managing multiple shards and provides a simplified interface to the application.
4.2.5 Object-Relational Mapping (ORM):
ORM is a programming technique that allows data to be seamlessly converted between the relational database format and the application’s object-oriented format.

---

It handles tasks like routing queries to the appropriate shard, managing transactions across shards, and abstracting the underlying complexities of database sharding.
ORM, within the edge wrapper, enables the application to interact with the database using high-level programming constructs, reducing the need for developers to write complex SQL queries.
This combination of edge wrapper and ORM simplifies database management, making it easier to scale the application horizontally with sharded databases while maintaining a cohesive and developer-friendly interface.

1. Requirements Gathering for Dropbox System Design
Functional Requirements:
The user should be able to upload photos/files.
The user should be able to create/delete directories on the drive.
The user should be able to download files
The user should be able to share the uploaded files.
The drive should synchronize the data between user all devices.
Non Functional Requirements:

---

Request Queue:
This will be a global request queue shared among all the clients.
Whenever a client receives any update or changes in the files/folder it sends the request through the request queue.
This request is received by the synchronization service to update the metadata database.
Response Queue:
There will be an individual response queue corresponding to the individual clients.
The synchronization service broadcast the update through this response queue and this response queue will deliver the updated messages to each client and then these clients will update their respective files accordingly.
The message will never be lost even if the client will be disconnected from the internet (the benefit of using the messaging queue service).

---

It acts as an intermediary, providing a unified interface for the application to interact with the database system.
The edge wrapper encapsulates the complexities of managing multiple shards and provides a simplified interface to the application.
4.2.5 Object-Relational Mapping (ORM):
ORM is a programming technique that allows data to be seamlessly converted between the relational database format and the application’s object-oriented format.

4.5. Cloud Storage
You can use any cloud storage service like Amazon S3 to store the chunks of the files uploaded by the user. The client communicates with the cloud storage for any action performed in the files/folders using the API provided by the cloud provider.

3.8. Downloading Services:
Clients initiate file download requests through the client application. The Download Service queries the Metadata Database for file details. The server’s Download Service retrieves metadata from the Metadata Database. Metadata includes information such as file name, size, owner, and access permissions.

4. Low-Level Design(LLD) of Dropbox System Design
A lot of people assume designing a Dropbox is that all they just need to do is to use some cloud services, upload the file, and download the file whenever they want but that’s not how it works. The core problem is “Where and how to save the files? “. Suppose you want to share a file that can be of any size (small or big) and you upload it into the cloud.

---

Everything is fine till here but later if you have to make an update in your file then it’s not a good idea to edit the file and upload the whole file again and again into the cloud. The reason is:

---

The synchronization service receives the request from the request queue of the messaging services and updates the metadata database with the latest changes.
Also, the synchronization service broadcast the latest update to the other clients (if there are multiple clients) through the response queue so that the other client’s indexer can fetch back the chunks from the cloud storage and recreate the files with the latest update.
It also updates the local database with the information stored in the Metadata Database. If a client is not connected to the internet or offline for some time, it polls the system for new updates as soon as it goes online.

Scaling can be achieved using techniques such as vertical scaling (increasing hardware capabilities) or horizontal scaling (adding more machines).
However, horizontal scaling for relational databases often involves complexities, especially in scenarios with high read and write operations.
4.2.2 Database Sharding:
Database sharding is a horizontal partitioning technique where a large database is divided into smaller, more manageable parts called shards.

---

It gives a notification to the indexer and chunker if any action is performed in the files or folders.
Chunker breaks the files into multiple small pieces called chunks and uploads them to the cloud storage with a unique id or hash of these chunks.
To recreate the files these chunks can be joined together. For any changes in the files, the chunking algorithm detects the specific chunk which is modified and only saves that specific part/chunk to the cloud storage.
It reduces bandwidth usage, synchronization time, and storage space in the cloud.
Indexer is responsible for updating the internal database when it receives the notification from the watcher (for any action performed in folders/files).

You just need to save the chunk which is updated (this will take less memory and time). It will be easier to keep the different versions of the files in various chunks.
We have considered one file which is divided into various chunks. If there are multiple files then we need to know which chunks belong to which file.
To keep this information we will create one more file named a metadata file. This file contains the indexes of the chunks (chunk names and order information).
You need to mention the hash of the chunks (or some reference) in this metadata file and you need to sync this file into the cloud. We can download the metadata file from the cloud whenever we want and we can recreate the file using various chunks.

1. Requirements Gathering for Dropbox System Design
Functional Requirements:
The user should be able to upload photos/files.
The user should be able to create/delete directories on the drive.
The user should be able to download files
The user should be able to share the uploaded files.
The drive should synchronize the data between user all devices.
Non Functional Requirements:

---

It handles tasks like routing queries to the appropriate shard, managing transactions across shards, and abstracting the underlying complexities of database sharding.
ORM, within the edge wrapper, enables the application to interact with the database using high-level programming constructs, reducing the need for developers to write complex SQL queries.
This combination of edge wrapper and ORM simplifies database management, making it easier to scale the application horizontally with sharded databases while maintaining a cohesive and developer-friendly interface.
design-dropbox-3

4.3. Message Queuing Service
The messaging service queue will be responsible for the asynchronous communication between the clients and the synchronization service. 

design-dropbox-4

---

Request Queue:
This will be a global request queue shared among all the clients.
Whenever a client receives any update or changes in the files/folder it sends the request through the request queue.
This request is received by the synchronization service to update the metadata database.
Response Queue:
There will be an individual response queue corresponding to the individual clients.
The synchronization service broadcast the update through this response queue and this response queue will deliver the updated messages to each client and then these clients will update their respective files accordingly.
The message will never be lost even if the client will be disconnected from the internet (the benefit of using the messaging queue service).

---

It acts as an intermediary, providing a unified interface for the application to interact with the database system.
The edge wrapper encapsulates the complexities of managing multiple shards and provides a simplified interface to the application.
4.2.5 Object-Relational Mapping (ORM):
ORM is a programming technique that allows data to be seamlessly converted between the relational database format and the application’s object-oriented format.

---

4.5. Cloud Storage
You can use any cloud storage service like Amazon S3 to store the chunks of the files uploaded by the user. The client communicates with the cloud storage for any action performed in the files/folders using the API provided by the cloud provider.

---

3.8. Downloading Services:
Clients initiate file download requests through the client application. The Download Service queries the Metadata Database for file details. The server’s Download Service retrieves metadata from the Metadata Database. Metadata includes information such as file name, size, owner, and access permissions.

4. Low-Level Design(LLD) of Dropbox System Design
A lot of people assume designing a Dropbox is that all they just need to do is to use some cloud services, upload the file, and download the file whenever they want but that’s not how it works. The core problem is “Where and how to save the files? “. Suppose you want to share a file that can be of any size (small or big) and you upload it into the cloud.

---

Everything is fine till here but later if you have to make an update in your file then it’s not a good idea to edit the file and upload the whole file again and again into the cloud. The reason is:

---

The synchronization service receives the request from the request queue of the messaging services and updates the metadata database with the latest changes.
Also, the synchronization service broadcast the latest update to the other clients (if there are multiple clients) through the response queue so that the other client’s indexer can fetch back the chunks from the cloud storage and recreate the files with the latest update.
It also updates the local database with the information stored in the Metadata Database. If a client is not connected to the internet or offline for some time, it polls the system for new updates as soon as it goes online.
4.5. Cloud Storage

---

Scaling can be achieved using techniques such as vertical scaling (increasing hardware capabilities) or horizontal scaling (adding more machines).
However, horizontal scaling for relational databases often involves complexities, especially in scenarios with high read and write operations.
4.2.2 Database Sharding:
Database sharding is a horizontal partitioning technique where a large database is divided into smaller, more manageable parts called shards.

---

It gives a notification to the indexer and chunker if any action is performed in the files or folders.
Chunker breaks the files into multiple small pieces called chunks and uploads them to the cloud storage with a unique id or hash of these chunks.
To recreate the files these chunks can be joined together. For any changes in the files, the chunking algorithm detects the specific chunk which is modified and only saves that specific part/chunk to the cloud storage.
It reduces bandwidth usage, synchronization time, and storage space in the cloud.
Indexer is responsible for updating the internal database when it receives the notification from the watcher (for any action performed in folders/files).

Let’s assume we have a client installed on our computer (an app installed on your computer) and this client has 4 basic components. These basic components are Watcher, Chunker, Indexer, and Internal DB. We have considered only one client but there can be multiple clients belonging to the same user with the same basic components.

Meta Service will check the database and return an array of objects containing name of object, object id, object type and an array of chunk_ids. Client calls the Download Chunk API with these chunk_ids to download the chunks and reconstruct the file.

---

Scaling can be achieved using techniques such as vertical scaling (increasing hardware capabilities) or horizontal scaling (adding more machines).
However, horizontal scaling for relational databases often involves complexities, especially in scenarios with high read and write operations.
4.2.2 Database Sharding:
Database sharding is a horizontal partitioning technique where a large database is divided into smaller, more manageable parts called shards.

---

It gives a notification to the indexer and chunker if any action is performed in the files or folders.
Chunker breaks the files into multiple small pieces called chunks and uploads them to the cloud storage with a unique id or hash of these chunks.
To recreate the files these chunks can be joined together. For any changes in the files, the chunking algorithm detects the specific chunk which is modified and only saves that specific part/chunk to the cloud storage.
It reduces bandwidth usage, synchronization time, and storage space in the cloud.
Indexer is responsible for updating the internal database when it receives the notification from the watcher (for any action performed in folders/files).

---

You just need to save the chunk which is updated (this will take less memory and time). It will be easier to keep the different versions of the files in various chunks.
We have considered one file which is divided into various chunks. If there are multiple files then we need to know which chunks belong to which file.
To keep this information we will create one more file named a metadata file. This file contains the indexes of the chunks (chunk names and order information).
You need to mention the hash of the chunks (or some reference) in this metadata file and you need to sync this file into the cloud. We can download the metadata file from the cloud whenever we want and we can recreate the file using various chunks.

---

We can break the files into multiple chunks to overcome the problem we discussed above. There is no need to upload/download the whole single file after making any changes in the file.

---

We are creating n number of response queues for n number of clients because the message will be deleted from the queue once it will be received by the client and we need to share the updated message with the various subscribed clients.
4.4. Synchronization Service
The client communicates with the synchronization services either to receive the latest update from the cloud storage or to send the latest request/updates to the Cloud Storage.

---

The total number of users = 500 million.
Total number of daily active users = 100 million
The average number of files stored by each user = 200
The average size of each file = 100 KB
Total number of active connections per minute = 1 million

Total number of files = 500 million * 200 = 100 billion

1. Requirements Gathering for Dropbox System Design
Functional Requirements:
The user should be able to upload photos/files.
The user should be able to create/delete directories on the drive.
The user should be able to download files
The user should be able to share the uploaded files.
The drive should synchronize the data between user all devices.
Non Functional Requirements:

---

Request Queue:
This will be a global request queue shared among all the clients.
Whenever a client receives any update or changes in the files/folder it sends the request through the request queue.
This request is received by the synchronization service to update the metadata database.
Response Queue:
There will be an individual response queue corresponding to the individual clients.
The synchronization service broadcast the update through this response queue and this response queue will deliver the updated messages to each client and then these clients will update their respective files accordingly.
The message will never be lost even if the client will be disconnected from the internet (the benefit of using the messaging queue service).

---

It acts as an intermediary, providing a unified interface for the application to interact with the database system.
The edge wrapper encapsulates the complexities of managing multiple shards and provides a simplified interface to the application.
4.2.5 Object-Relational Mapping (ORM):
ORM is a programming technique that allows data to be seamlessly converted between the relational database format and the application’s object-oriented format.

---

You just need to save the chunk which is updated (this will take less memory and time). It will be easier to keep the different versions of the files in various chunks.
We have considered one file which is divided into various chunks. If there are multiple files then we need to know which chunks belong to which file.
To keep this information we will create one more file named a metadata file. This file contains the indexes of the chunks (chunk names and order information).
You need to mention the hash of the chunks (or some reference) in this metadata file and you need to sync this file into the cloud. We can download the metadata file from the cloud whenever we want and we can recreate the file using various chunks.

---

4.5. Cloud Storage
You can use any cloud storage service like Amazon S3 to store the chunks of the files uploaded by the user. The client communicates with the cloud storage for any action performed in the files/folders using the API provided by the cloud provider.

---

3.8. Downloading Services:
Clients initiate file download requests through the client application. The Download Service queries the Metadata Database for file details. The server’s Download Service retrieves metadata from the Metadata Database. Metadata includes information such as file name, size, owner, and access permissions.

The core problem is “Where and how to save the files? “. Suppose you want to share a file that can be of any size (small or big) and you upload it into the cloud.

---

Everything is fine till here but later if you have to make an update in your file then it’s not a good idea to edit the file and upload the whole file again and again into the cloud. The reason is:

---

The synchronization service receives the request from the request queue of the messaging services and updates the metadata database with the latest changes.
Also, the synchronization service broadcast the latest update to the other clients (if there are multiple clients) through the response queue so that the other client’s indexer can fetch back the chunks from the cloud storage and recreate the files with the latest update.
It also updates the local database with the information stored in the Metadata Database. If a client is not connected to the internet or offline for some time, it polls the system for new updates as soon as it goes online.

        chunk2,
        chunk3
      ]
    }
  ]
}
Meta Service will check the database and return an array of objects containing name of object, object id, object type and an array of chunk_ids. Client calls the Download Chunk API with these chunk_ids to download the chunks and reconstruct the file.

---

Scaling can be achieved using techniques such as vertical scaling (increasing hardware capabilities) or horizontal scaling (adding more machines).
However, horizontal scaling for relational databases often involves complexities, especially in scenarios with high read and write operations.
4.2.2 Database Sharding:
Database sharding is a horizontal partitioning technique where a large database is divided into smaller, more manageable parts called shards.

---

It gives a notification to the indexer and chunker if any action is performed in the files or folders.
Chunker breaks the files into multiple small pieces called chunks and uploads them to the cloud storage with a unique id or hash of these chunks.
To recreate the files these chunks can be joined together. For any changes in the files, the chunking algorithm detects the specific chunk which is modified and only saves that specific part/chunk to the cloud storage.
It reduces bandwidth usage, synchronization time, and storage space in the cloud.
Indexer is responsible for updating the internal database when it receives the notification from the watcher (for any action performed in folders/files).

---

We are creating n number of response queues for n number of clients because the message will be deleted from the queue once it will be received by the client and we need to share the updated message with the various subscribed clients.
4.4. Synchronization Service
The client communicates with the synchronization services either to receive the latest update from the cloud storage or to send the latest request/updates to the Cloud Storage.

---

We can break the files into multiple chunks to overcome the problem we discussed above. There is no need to upload/download the whole single file after making any changes in the file.

---

Now let’s talk about the various components for the complete low level design solution of the Dropbox.

It handles tasks like routing queries to the appropriate shard, managing transactions across shards, and abstracting the underlying complexities of database sharding.
ORM, within the edge wrapper, enables the application to interact with the database using high-level programming constructs, reducing the need for developers to write complex SQL queries.
This combination of edge wrapper and ORM simplifies database management, making it easier to scale the application horizontally with sharded databases while maintaining a cohesive and developer-friendly interface.

4.2.5 Object-Relational Mapping (ORM):
ORM is a programming technique that allows data to be seamlessly converted between the relational database format and the application’s object-oriented format.

---

4.5. Cloud Storage
You can use any cloud storage service like Amazon S3 to store the chunks of the files uploaded by the user. The client communicates with the cloud storage for any action performed in the files/folders using the API provided by the cloud provider.

---

3.8. Downloading Services:
Clients initiate file download requests through the client application. The Download Service queries the Metadata Database for file details. The server’s Download Service retrieves metadata from the Metadata Database. Metadata includes information such as file name, size, owner, and access permissions.

4. Low-Level Design(LLD) of Dropbox System Design
A lot of people assume designing a Dropbox is that all they just need to do is to use some cloud services, upload the file, and download the file whenever they want but that’s not how it works. The core problem is “Where and how to save the files? “. Suppose you want to share a file that can be of any size (small or big) and you upload it into the cloud.

---

Everything is fine till here but later if you have to make an update in your file then it’s not a good idea to edit the file and upload the whole file again and again into the cloud. The reason is:

---

The synchronization service receives the request from the request queue of the messaging services and updates the metadata database with the latest changes.
Also, the synchronization service broadcast the latest update to the other clients (if there are multiple clients) through the response queue so that the other client’s indexer can fetch back the chunks from the cloud storage and recreate the files with the latest update.
It also updates the local database with the information stored in the Metadata Database. If a client is not connected to the internet or offline for some time, it polls the system for new updates as soon as it goes online.
4.5. Cloud Storage

---

Request Queue:
This will be a global request queue shared among all the clients.
Whenever a client receives any update or changes in the files/folder it sends the request through the request queue.
This request is received by the synchronization service to update the metadata database.
Response Queue:
There will be an individual response queue corresponding to the individual clients.
The synchronization service broadcast the update through this response queue and this response queue will deliver the updated messages to each client and then these clients will update their respective files accordingly.
The message will never be lost even if the client will be disconnected from the internet (the benefit of using the messaging queue service).

design-dropbox-2

Let’s assume we have a client installed on our computer (an app installed on your computer) and this client has 4 basic components. These basic components are Watcher, Chunker, Indexer, and Internal DB. We have considered only one client but there can be multiple clients belonging to the same user with the same basic components.

Request

GET /api/v1/objects?local_object_id=<Max object_id present locally>&device_id=<Unique Device Id>
X-API-Key: api_key
Authorization: auth_token
Response

200 OK

  new_objects: [
    {
      object_id:

        chunk1,
        chunk2,
        chunk3
      ]
    }
  ]
}
Meta Service will check the database and return an array of objects containing name of object, object id, object type and an array of chunk_ids. Client calls the Download Chunk API with these chunk_ids to download the chunks and reconstruct the file.

---

It gives a notification to the indexer and chunker if any action is performed in the files or folders.
Chunker breaks the files into multiple small pieces called chunks and uploads them to the cloud storage with a unique id or hash of these chunks.
To recreate the files these chunks can be joined together. For any changes in the files, the chunking algorithm detects the specific chunk which is modified and only saves that specific part/chunk to the cloud storage.
It reduces bandwidth usage, synchronization time, and storage space in the cloud.
Indexer is responsible for updating the internal database when it receives the notification from the watcher (for any action performed in folders/files).

---

We are creating n number of response queues for n number of clients because the message will be deleted from the queue once it will be received by the client and we need to share the updated message with the various subscribed clients.
4.4. Synchronization Service
The client communicates with the synchronization services either to receive the latest update from the cloud storage or to send the latest request/updates to the Cloud Storage.

---

Now let’s talk about the various components for the complete low level design solution of the Dropbox.

6. API Design for Dropbox System Design
6.1 Download Chunk
This API would be used to download the chunk of a file.

Request

GET /api/v1/chunks/:chunk_id
X-API-Key: api_key
Authorization: auth_token
Response

---

The total number of users = 500 million.
Total number of daily active users = 100 million
The average number of files stored by each user = 200
The average size of each file = 100 KB
Total number of active connections per minute = 1 million

Storage Estimations:

Total number of files = 500 million * 200 = 100 billion
Total storage required = 100 billion * 100 KB = 10 PB

You just need to save the chunk which is updated (this will take less memory and time). It will be easier to keep the different versions of the files in various chunks.
We have considered one file which is divided into various chunks. If there are multiple files then we need to know which chunks belong to which file.
To keep this information we will create one more file named a metadata file. This file contains the indexes of the chunks (chunk names and order information).
You need to mention the hash of the chunks (or some reference) in this metadata file and you need to sync this file into the cloud. We can download the metadata file from the cloud whenever we want and we can recreate the file using various chunks.",127.6914882659912,"6.0 Security Considerations: Data Encryption for Dropbox Files

1. Requirements Gathering for Dropbox System Design
Functional Requirements:
The user should be able to upload photos/files.
The user should be able to create/delete directories on the drive.
The user should be able to download files
The user should be able to share the uploaded files.
The drive should synchronize the data between user all devices.
Non Functional Requirements:

---

It acts as an intermediary, providing a unified interface for the application to interact with the database system.
The edge wrapper encapsulates the complexities of managing multiple shards and provides a simplified interface to the application.
4.2.5 Object-Relational Mapping (ORM):
ORM is a programming technique that allows data to be seamlessly converted between the relational database format and the application’s object-oriented format.

---

Request Queue:
This will be a global request queue shared among all the clients.
Whenever a client receives any update or changes in the files/folder it sends the request through the request queue.
This request is received by the synchronization service to update the metadata database.
Response Queue:
There will be an individual response queue corresponding to the individual clients.
The synchronization service broadcast the update through this response queue and this response queue will deliver the updated messages to each client and then these clients will update their respective files accordingly.
The message will never be lost even if the client will be disconnected from the internet (the benefit of using the messaging queue service).

---

It handles tasks like routing queries to the appropriate shard, managing transactions across shards, and abstracting the underlying complexities of database sharding.
ORM, within the edge wrapper, enables the application to interact with the database using high-level programming constructs, reducing the need for developers to write complex SQL queries.
This combination of edge wrapper and ORM simplifies database management, making it easier to scale the application horizontally with sharded databases while maintaining a cohesive and developer-friendly interface.

4.5. Cloud Storage
You can use any cloud storage service like Amazon S3 to store the chunks of the files uploaded by the user. The client communicates with the cloud storage for any action performed in the files/folders using the API provided by the cloud provider.

---

3.8. Downloading Services:
Clients initiate file download requests through the client application. The Download Service queries the Metadata Database for file details. The server’s Download Service retrieves metadata from the Metadata Database. Metadata includes information such as file name, size, owner, and access permissions.

4. Low-Level Design(LLD) of Dropbox System Design
A lot of people assume designing a Dropbox is that all they just need to do is to use some cloud services, upload the file, and download the file whenever they want but that’s not how it works. The core problem is “Where and how to save the files? “. Suppose you want to share a file that can be of any size (small or big) and you upload it into the cloud.

---

Everything is fine till here but later if you have to make an update in your file then it’s not a good idea to edit the file and upload the whole file again and again into the cloud. The reason is:

---

The synchronization service receives the request from the request queue of the messaging services and updates the metadata database with the latest changes.
Also, the synchronization service broadcast the latest update to the other clients (if there are multiple clients) through the response queue so that the other client’s indexer can fetch back the chunks from the cloud storage and recreate the files with the latest update.
It also updates the local database with the information stored in the Metadata Database. If a client is not connected to the internet or offline for some time, it polls the system for new updates as soon as it goes online.

Scaling can be achieved using techniques such as vertical scaling (increasing hardware capabilities) or horizontal scaling (adding more machines).
However, horizontal scaling for relational databases often involves complexities, especially in scenarios with high read and write operations.

The client uses the Presigned URL to upload the file directly to the designated S3 bucket. Metadata associated with the file, such as file name and owner, is included in the upload process. This ensures that the file’s metadata is synchronized with its corresponding data in S3.

3.7. Role of Task Runner:

The task runner communicates with the Metadata Database to update or perform additional tasks related to the uploaded file. This may include updating file status, triggering indexing for search functionality, or sending notifications.",117.50076866149902,"8) The application should implement circuit breaker patterns and load balancers at various levels (API Gateway/CDN level).

This document outlines ten distinct use cases where a microservices architecture that utilizes an Event Driven Architecture (EDA) is beneficial. Each scenario highlights the importance of loose coupling and scalability afforded by EDA, which are critical for high-availability systems in cloud environments or on edge devices with limited resources like Raspberry Pi 4B/Pi3+. The use cases span various application domains such as IoT sensor data processing (Use Case #1), distributed machine learning inference tasks (Use Cases #2,#9 and #10), real-time financial transaction handling systems on edge devices (Use Cases #5 and #6), high throughput content delivery networks (Cdn) for streaming services (Use Case #3). The document also touches upon the benefits of EDA in managing peak load events with a focus on asynchronous communication, resource efficiency during scaling operations to manage service demands without over-provisioning resources. Moreover, it explains how event handling can be tailored through RabbitMQ's advanced features for prioritizing critical messages and ensuring timely delivery (Use Cases #2–#10).
  
Follow up question 1: How does a microservices architecture benefit from the use of EDA in terms of service resilience?
    Answer: A microservices architecture benefits greatly from Event Driven Architecture as it promotes high levels of service resilience. With event-driven messaging, individual services can independently handle events or failures without affecting other parts of the system directly (e.g., if a sensor data processing service fails to process an incoming message due to overload). The failure is contained within one microservice and does not propagate throughout the entire application. EDA allows for built-in fault tolerance, automatic retries or failovers by handling events asynchronously thus ensuring that critical operations continue even when certain components encounter problems.
    Follow up question 2: What are some of the challenges in implementing a microservices architecture with an event-driven approach?
   Answer: Implementing a microservice architecture along with Event Driven Architecture comes with its set of complexities and potential roadblocks, such as network latency due to asynchronous communication between services. Managing these events requires sophisticated orchestration tools like Kafka or RabbitMQ which come with their own learning curves for setting up proper event handling workflows (Use Case #2). Handling large volumes of data in a distributed system also presents challenges, including ensuring that the entirety of critical messages is processed and maintaining consistency. It requires comprehensive monitoring systems to identify bottlenecks or failures promptly so they can be addressed before causing significant disruptions (Use Cases #3-#10).
   Follow up question 3: How does Event Driven Architecture support scalability in a microservices architecture?
    Answer: Event Driven Architecture supports scalability by enabling services to process events independently of one another. This allows for individual components that are experiencing high load can be scaled without affecting the rest (Use Case #2). EDA facilitates both vertical and horizontal scaling, where resources such as servers or microservices instances can be added dynamically based on demand – a critical capability to handle fluctuating workloads efficiently. This is particularly useful in cloud environments that offer elasticity for automated resource allocation (Use Case #3). Additionally, the asynchronous nature of event processing allows services to remain responsive even during peak loads by queuing events and managing them as they come without stalling service operations or causing delays due to synchronous communication patterns.

This document outlines ten distinct use cases where a microservices architecture that utilizes an Event Driven Architecture (EDA) is beneficial. Each scenario highlights the importance of loose coupling and scalability afforded by EDA, which are critical for high-availability systems in cloud environments or on edge devices with limited resources like Raspberry Pi 4B/Pi3+. The use cases span various application domains such as IoT sensor data processing (Use Case #1), distributed machine learning inference tasks (Use Cases #2,#9 and #10), real-time financial transaction handling systems on edge devices (Use Cases #5 and #6), high throughput content delivery networks (Cdn) for streaming services (Use Case #3). The document also touches upon the benefits of EDA in managing peak load events with a focus on asynchronous communication, resource efficiency during scaling operations to manage service demands without over-provisioning resources. Moreover, it explains how event handling can be tailored through RabbitMQ's advanced features for prioritizing critical messages and ensuring timely delivery (Use Cases #2–#10).
  
Follow up question 1: How does a microservices architecture benefit from the use of EDA in terms of service resilience?
    Answer: A microservices architecture benefits greatly from Event Driven Architecture as it promotes high levels of service resilience. With event-driven messaging, individual services can independently handle events or failures without affecting other parts of the system directly (e.g., if a sensor data processing service fails to process an incoming message due to overload). The failure is contained within one microservice and does not propagate throughout the entire application. EDA allows for built-in fault tolerance, automatic retries or failovers by handling events asynchronously thus ensuring that critical operations continue even when certain components encounter problems.
    Follow up question 2: What are some of the challenges in implementing a microservices architecture with an event-driven approach?
   Answer: Implementing a microservice architecture along with Event Driven Architecture comes with its set of complexities and potential roadblocks, such as network latency due to asynchronous communication between services. Managing these events requires sophisticated orchestration tools like Kafka or RabbitMQ which come with their own learning curves for setting up proper event handling workflows (Use Case #2). Handling large volumes of data in a distributed system also presents challenges, including ensuring that the entirety of critical messages is processed and maintaining consistency. It requires comprehensive monitoring systems to identify bottlenecks or failures promptly so they can be addressed before causing significant disruptions (Use Cases #3-#10).
   Follow up question 3: How does Event Driven Architecture support scalability in a microservices architecture?
    Answer: Event Driven Architecture supports scalability by enabling services to process events independently of one another. This allows for individual components that are experiencing high load can be scaled without affecting the rest (Use Case #2). EDA facilitates both vertical and horizontal scaling, where resources such as servers or microservices instances can be added dynamically based on demand – a critical capability to handle fluctuating workloads efficiently. This is particularly useful in cloud environments that offer elasticity for automated resource allocation (Use Case #3). Additionally, the asynchronous nature of event processing allows services to remain responsive even during peak loads by queuing events and managing them as they come without stalling service operations or causing delays due to synchronous communication patterns.

Request Queue:
This will be a global request queue shared among all the clients.
Whenever a client receives any update or changes in the files/folder it sends the request through the request queue.
This request is received by the synchronization service to update the metadata database.
Response Queue:
There will be an individual response queue corresponding to the individual clients.
The synchronization service broadcast the update through this response queue and this response queue will deliver the updated messages to each client and then these clients will update their respective files accordingly.
The message will never be lost even if the client will be disconnected from the internet (the benefit of using the messaging queue service).

design-dropbox-4

---

Request Queue:
This will be a global request queue shared among all the clients.
Whenever a client receives any update or changes in the files/folder it sends the request through the request queue.
This request is received by the synchronization service to update the metadata database.
Response Queue:
There will be an individual response queue corresponding to the individual clients.
The synchronization service broadcast the update through this response queue and this response queue will deliver the updated messages to each client and then these clients will update their respective files accordingly.
The message will never be lost even if the client will be disconnected from the internet (the benefit of using the messaging queue service).

---

ACID properties: Atomicity, Consistency, Integrity and Durability. All the file operations should follow these properties.
2. Capacity Estimation for Dropbox System Design
Storage Estimations:
Assumptions:

---

4.5. Cloud Storage
You can use any cloud storage service like Amazon S3 to store the chunks of the files uploaded by the user. The client communicates with the cloud storage for any action performed in the files/folders using the API provided by the cloud provider.

---

3.8. Downloading Services:
Clients initiate file download requests through the client application. The Download Service queries the Metadata Database for file details. The server’s Download Service retrieves metadata from the Metadata Database. Metadata includes information such as file name, size, owner, and access permissions.

4. Low-Level Design(LLD) of Dropbox System Design
A lot of people assume designing a Dropbox is that all they just need to do is to use some cloud services, upload the file, and download the file whenever they want but that’s not how it works. The core problem is “Where and how to save the files? “. Suppose you want to share a file that can be of any size (small or big) and you upload it into the cloud.

---

Everything is fine till here but later if you have to make an update in your file then it’s not a good idea to edit the file and upload the whole file again and again into the cloud. The reason is:

---

The synchronization service receives the request from the request queue of the messaging services and updates the metadata database with the latest changes.
Also, the synchronization service broadcast the latest update to the other clients (if there are multiple clients) through the response queue so that the other client’s indexer can fetch back the chunks from the cloud storage and recreate the files with the latest update.
It also updates the local database with the information stored in the Metadata Database. If a client is not connected to the internet or offline for some time, it polls the system for new updates as soon as it goes online.

        chunk3
      ]
    }
  ]
}
Meta Service will check the database and return an array of objects containing name of object, object id, object type and an array of chunk_ids. Client calls the Download Chunk API with these chunk_ids to download the chunks and reconstruct the file.

---

We are creating n number of response queues for n number of clients because the message will be deleted from the queue once it will be received by the client and we need to share the updated message with the various subscribed clients.
4.4. Synchronization Service
The client communicates with the synchronization services either to receive the latest update from the cloud storage or to send the latest request/updates to the Cloud Storage.

---

We can break the files into multiple chunks to overcome the problem we discussed above. There is no need to upload/download the whole single file after making any changes in the file.

---

The total number of users = 500 million.
Total number of daily active users = 100 million
The average number of files stored by each user = 200
The average size of each file = 100 KB
Total number of active connections per minute = 1 million

Storage Estimations:

Total number of files = 500 million * 200 = 100 billion
Total storage required = 100 billion * 100 KB = 10 PB


3. High-Level Design(HLD) of Dropbox System Design
HighLevelDesignOfdropBoxdrawio-(2)

3.1. User Uploading:
Users interact with the client application or web interface to initiate file uploads. The client application communicates with the Upload Service on the server side. Large files may be broken into smaller chunks for efficient transfer.

---

It gives a notification to the indexer and chunker if any action is performed in the files or folders.
Chunker breaks the files into multiple small pieces called chunks and uploads them to the cloud storage with a unique id or hash of these chunks.
To recreate the files these chunks can be joined together. For any changes in the files, the chunking algorithm detects the specific chunk which is modified and only saves that specific part/chunk to the cloud storage.
It reduces bandwidth usage, synchronization time, and storage space in the cloud.
Indexer is responsible for updating the internal database when it receives the notification from the watcher (for any action performed in folders/files).

---

Scaling can be achieved using techniques such as vertical scaling (increasing hardware capabilities) or horizontal scaling (adding more machines).
However, horizontal scaling for relational databases often involves complexities, especially in scenarios with high read and write operations.
4.2.2 Database Sharding:
Database sharding is a horizontal partitioning technique where a large database is divided into smaller, more manageable parts called shards.

---

It acts as an intermediary, providing a unified interface for the application to interact with the database system.
The edge wrapper encapsulates the complexities of managing multiple shards and provides a simplified interface to the application.
4.2.5 Object-Relational Mapping (ORM):
ORM is a programming technique that allows data to be seamlessly converted between the relational database format and the application’s object-oriented format.

---

You just need to save the chunk which is updated (this will take less memory and time). It will be easier to keep the different versions of the files in various chunks.
We have considered one file which is divided into various chunks. If there are multiple files then we need to know which chunks belong to which file.
To keep this information we will create one more file named a metadata file. This file contains the indexes of the chunks (chunk names and order information).
You need to mention the hash of the chunks (or some reference) in this metadata file and you need to sync this file into the cloud. We can download the metadata file from the cloud whenever we want and we can recreate the file using various chunks.",194.67116379737857,"200 OK

This will be a global request queue shared among all the clients.
Whenever a client receives any update or changes in the files/folder it sends the request through the request queue.
This request is received by the synchronization service to update the metadata database.
Response Queue:
There will be an individual response queue corresponding to the individual clients.
The synchronization service broadcast the update through this response queue and this response queue will deliver the updated messages to each client and then these clients will update their respective files accordingly.

1. Requirements Gathering for Dropbox System Design
Functional Requirements:
The user should be able to upload photos/files.
The user should be able to create/delete directories on the drive.
The user should be able to download files
The user should be able to share the uploaded files.
The drive should synchronize the data between user all devices.
Non Functional Requirements:

---

It acts as an intermediary, providing a unified interface for the application to interact with the database system.
The edge wrapper encapsulates the complexities of managing multiple shards and provides a simplified interface to the application.
4.2.5 Object-Relational Mapping (ORM):
ORM is a programming technique that allows data to be seamlessly converted between the relational database format and the application’s object-oriented format.

---

It handles tasks like routing queries to the appropriate shard, managing transactions across shards, and abstracting the underlying complexities of database sharding.
ORM, within the edge wrapper, enables the application to interact with the database using high-level programming constructs, reducing the need for developers to write complex SQL queries.
This combination of edge wrapper and ORM simplifies database management, making it easier to scale the application horizontally with sharded databases while maintaining a cohesive and developer-friendly interface.

4.3. Message Queuing Service
The messaging service queue will be responsible for the asynchronous communication between the clients and the synchronization service. 

design-dropbox-4

---

4.5. Cloud Storage
You can use any cloud storage service like Amazon S3 to store the chunks of the files uploaded by the user. The client communicates with the cloud storage for any action performed in the files/folders using the API provided by the cloud provider.

---

3.8. Downloading Services:
Clients initiate file download requests through the client application. The Download Service queries the Metadata Database for file details. The server’s Download Service retrieves metadata from the Metadata Database. Metadata includes information such as file name, size, owner, and access permissions.

4. Low-Level Design(LLD) of Dropbox System Design
A lot of people assume designing a Dropbox is that all they just need to do is to use some cloud services, upload the file, and download the file whenever they want but that’s not how it works. The core problem is “Where and how to save the files? “. Suppose you want to share a file that can be of any size (small or big) and you upload it into the cloud.

---

Everything is fine till here but later if you have to make an update in your file then it’s not a good idea to edit the file and upload the whole file again and again into the cloud. The reason is:

---

The synchronization service receives the request from the request queue of the messaging services and updates the metadata database with the latest changes.
Also, the synchronization service broadcast the latest update to the other clients (if there are multiple clients) through the response queue so that the other client’s indexer can fetch back the chunks from the cloud storage and recreate the files with the latest update.
It also updates the local database with the information stored in the Metadata Database. If a client is not connected to the internet or offline for some time, it polls the system for new updates as soon as it goes online.

Let’s assume we have a client installed on our computer (an app installed on your computer) and this client has 4 basic components. These basic components are Watcher, Chunker, Indexer, and Internal DB. We have considered only one client but there can be multiple clients belonging to the same user with the same basic components.

---

We are creating n number of response queues for n number of clients because the message will be deleted from the queue once it will be received by the client and we need to share the updated message with the various subscribed clients.
4.4. Synchronization Service
The client communicates with the synchronization services either to receive the latest update from the cloud storage or to send the latest request/updates to the Cloud Storage.

---

It gives a notification to the indexer and chunker if any action is performed in the files or folders.
Chunker breaks the files into multiple small pieces called chunks and uploads them to the cloud storage with a unique id or hash of these chunks.
To recreate the files these chunks can be joined together. For any changes in the files, the chunking algorithm detects the specific chunk which is modified and only saves that specific part/chunk to the cloud storage.
It reduces bandwidth usage, synchronization time, and storage space in the cloud.
Indexer is responsible for updating the internal database when it receives the notification from the watcher (for any action performed in folders/files).

---

Scaling can be achieved using techniques such as vertical scaling (increasing hardware capabilities) or horizontal scaling (adding more machines).
However, horizontal scaling for relational databases often involves complexities, especially in scenarios with high read and write operations.
4.2.2 Database Sharding:
Database sharding is a horizontal partitioning technique where a large database is divided into smaller, more manageable parts called shards.

---

You just need to save the chunk which is updated (this will take less memory and time). It will be easier to keep the different versions of the files in various chunks.
We have considered one file which is divided into various chunks. If there are multiple files then we need to know which chunks belong to which file.
To keep this information we will create one more file named a metadata file. This file contains the indexes of the chunks (chunk names and order information).

It handles tasks like routing queries to the appropriate shard, managing transactions across shards, and abstracting the underlying complexities of database sharding.
ORM, within the edge wrapper, enables the application to interact with the database using high-level programming constructs, reducing the need for developers to write complex SQL queries.
This combination of edge wrapper and ORM simplifies database management, making it easier to scale the application horizontally with sharded databases while maintaining a cohesive and developer-friendly interface.

---

It acts as an intermediary, providing a unified interface for the application to interact with the database system.
The edge wrapper encapsulates the complexities of managing multiple shards and provides a simplified interface to the application.
4.2.5 Object-Relational Mapping (ORM):
ORM is a programming technique that allows data to be seamlessly converted between the relational database format and the application’s object-oriented format.

---

4.5. Cloud Storage
You can use any cloud storage service like Amazon S3 to store the chunks of the files uploaded by the user. The client communicates with the cloud storage for any action performed in the files/folders using the API provided by the cloud provider.

---

3.8. Downloading Services:
Clients initiate file download requests through the client application. The Download Service queries the Metadata Database for file details. The server’s Download Service retrieves metadata from the Metadata Database. Metadata includes information such as file name, size, owner, and access permissions.

4. Low-Level Design(LLD) of Dropbox System Design
A lot of people assume designing a Dropbox is that all they just need to do is to use some cloud services, upload the file, and download the file whenever they want but that’s not how it works. The core problem is “Where and how to save the files? “. Suppose you want to share a file that can be of any size (small or big) and you upload it into the cloud.

---

Everything is fine till here but later if you have to make an update in your file then it’s not a good idea to edit the file and upload the whole file again and again into the cloud. The reason is:

---

The synchronization service receives the request from the request queue of the messaging services and updates the metadata database with the latest changes.
Also, the synchronization service broadcast the latest update to the other clients (if there are multiple clients) through the response queue so that the other client’s indexer can fetch back the chunks from the cloud storage and recreate the files with the latest update.
It also updates the local database with the information stored in the Metadata Database. If a client is not connected to the internet or offline for some time, it polls the system for new updates as soon as it goes online.
4.5. Cloud Storage

---

Request Queue:
This will be a global request queue shared among all the clients.
Whenever a client receives any update or changes in the files/folder it sends the request through the request queue.
This request is received by the synchronization service to update the metadata database.
Response Queue:
There will be an individual response queue corresponding to the individual clients.
The synchronization service broadcast the update through this response queue and this response queue will deliver the updated messages to each client and then these clients will update their respective files accordingly.
The message will never be lost even if the client will be disconnected from the internet (the benefit of using the messaging queue service).

---

It gives a notification to the indexer and chunker if any action is performed in the files or folders.
Chunker breaks the files into multiple small pieces called chunks and uploads them to the cloud storage with a unique id or hash of these chunks.
To recreate the files these chunks can be joined together. For any changes in the files, the chunking algorithm detects the specific chunk which is modified and only saves that specific part/chunk to the cloud storage.
It reduces bandwidth usage, synchronization time, and storage space in the cloud.
Indexer is responsible for updating the internal database when it receives the notification from the watcher (for any action performed in folders/files).

---

It maps database tables to application objects, providing a convenient way to interact with the database using programming language constructs.
ORM helps abstract away the intricacies of SQL queries and database schema, making it easier for developers to work with databases.
4.2.6 Edge Wrapper and ORM:
The edge wrapper integrates ORM functionality to provide a convenient interface for the application to interact with sharded databases.

---

Request

GET /api/v1/objects?local_object_id=<Max object_id present locally>&device_id=<Unique Device Id>
X-API-Key: api_key
Authorization: auth_token
Response

200 OK
{
  new_objects: [
    {
      object_id:
      object_type:

        chunk1,
        chunk2,
        chunk3
      ]
    }
  ]
}
Meta Service will check the database and return an array of objects containing name of object, object id, object type and an array of chunk_ids. Client calls the Download Chunk API with these chunk_ids to download the chunks and reconstruct the file.

---

Scaling can be achieved using techniques such as vertical scaling (increasing hardware capabilities) or horizontal scaling (adding more machines).
However, horizontal scaling for relational databases often involves complexities, especially in scenarios with high read and write operations.
4.2.2 Database Sharding:
Database sharding is a horizontal partitioning technique where a large database is divided into smaller, more manageable parts called shards.

---

3.6. Uploading to S3 using Presigned URL and Metadata:
The client uses the Presigned URL to upload the file directly to the designated S3 bucket. Metadata associated with the file, such as file name and owner, is included in the upload process. This ensures that the file’s metadata is synchronized with its corresponding data in S3.

3.7. Role of Task Runner:
After the file is successfully uploaded to S3, a task runner process is triggered. The task runner communicates with the Metadata Database to update or perform additional tasks related to the uploaded file. This may include updating file status, triggering indexing for search functionality, or sending notifications.

---

Now let’s talk about the various components for the complete low level design solution of the Dropbox.

6. API Design for Dropbox System Design
6.1 Download Chunk
This API would be used to download the chunk of a file.

Request

GET /api/v1/chunks/:chunk_id
X-API-Key: api_key
Authorization: auth_token
Response

---

The total number of users = 500 million.
Total number of daily active users = 100 million
The average number of files stored by each user = 200
The average size of each file = 100 KB
Total number of active connections per minute = 1 million

Storage Estimations:

Total number of files = 500 million * 200 = 100 billion
Total storage required = 100 billion * 100 KB = 10 PB

This combination of edge wrapper and ORM simplifies database management, making it easier to scale the application horizontally with sharded databases while maintaining a cohesive and developer-friendly interface.

4.5. Cloud Storage
You can use any cloud storage service like Amazon S3 to store the chunks of the files uploaded by the user. The client communicates with the cloud storage for any action performed in the files/folders using the API provided by the cloud provider.

---

3.8. Downloading Services:
Clients initiate file download requests through the client application. The Download Service queries the Metadata Database for file details. The server’s Download Service retrieves metadata from the Metadata Database. Metadata includes information such as file name, size, owner, and access permissions.

4. Low-Level Design(LLD) of Dropbox System Design
A lot of people assume designing a Dropbox is that all they just need to do is to use some cloud services, upload the file, and download the file whenever they want but that’s not how it works. The core problem is “Where and how to save the files? “. Suppose you want to share a file that can be of any size (small or big) and you upload it into the cloud.

---

Everything is fine till here but later if you have to make an update in your file then it’s not a good idea to edit the file and upload the whole file again and again into the cloud. The reason is:

---

The synchronization service receives the request from the request queue of the messaging services and updates the metadata database with the latest changes.
Also, the synchronization service broadcast the latest update to the other clients (if there are multiple clients) through the response queue so that the other client’s indexer can fetch back the chunks from the cloud storage and recreate the files with the latest update.
It also updates the local database with the information stored in the Metadata Database. If a client is not connected to the internet or offline for some time, it polls the system for new updates as soon as it goes online.

Let’s assume we have a client installed on our computer (an app installed on your computer) and this client has 4 basic components. These basic components are Watcher, Chunker, Indexer, and Internal DB. We have considered only one client but there can be multiple clients belonging to the same user with the same basic components.

Scaling can be achieved using techniques such as vertical scaling (increasing hardware capabilities) or horizontal scaling (adding more machines).
However, horizontal scaling for relational databases often involves complexities, especially in scenarios with high read and write operations.
4.2.2 Database Sharding:
Database sharding is a horizontal partitioning technique where a large database is divided into smaller, more manageable parts called shards.

---

It gives a notification to the indexer and chunker if any action is performed in the files or folders.
Chunker breaks the files into multiple small pieces called chunks and uploads them to the cloud storage with a unique id or hash of these chunks.
To recreate the files these chunks can be joined together. For any changes in the files, the chunking algorithm detects the specific chunk which is modified and only saves that specific part/chunk to the cloud storage.
It reduces bandwidth usage, synchronization time, and storage space in the cloud.
Indexer is responsible for updating the internal database when it receives the notification from the watcher (for any action performed in folders/files).

---

ACID properties: Atomicity, Consistency, Integrity and Durability. All the file operations should follow these properties.

It handles tasks like routing queries to the appropriate shard, managing transactions across shards, and abstracting the underlying complexities of database sharding.
ORM, within the edge wrapper, enables the application to interact with the database using high-level programming constructs, reducing the need for developers to write complex SQL queries.
This combination of edge wrapper and ORM simplifies database management, making it easier to scale the application horizontally with sharded databases while maintaining a cohesive and developer-friendly interface.

4.3. Message Queuing Service
The messaging service queue will be responsible for the asynchronous communication between the clients and the synchronization service.

It acts as an intermediary, providing a unified interface for the application to interact with the database system.
The edge wrapper encapsulates the complexities of managing multiple shards and provides a simplified interface to the application.
4.2.5 Object-Relational Mapping (ORM):
ORM is a programming technique that allows data to be seamlessly converted between the relational database format and the application’s object-oriented format.

---

Request Queue:
This will be a global request queue shared among all the clients.
Whenever a client receives any update or changes in the files/folder it sends the request through the request queue.
This request is received by the synchronization service to update the metadata database.
Response Queue:
There will be an individual response queue corresponding to the individual clients.
The synchronization service broadcast the update through this response queue and this response queue will deliver the updated messages to each client and then these clients will update their respective files accordingly.
The message will never be lost even if the client will be disconnected from the internet (the benefit of using the messaging queue service).

---

4.5. Cloud Storage
You can use any cloud storage service like Amazon S3 to store the chunks of the files uploaded by the user. The client communicates with the cloud storage for any action performed in the files/folders using the API provided by the cloud provider.

---

3.8. Downloading Services:
Clients initiate file download requests through the client application. The Download Service queries the Metadata Database for file details. The server’s Download Service retrieves metadata from the Metadata Database. Metadata includes information such as file name, size, owner, and access permissions.

4. Low-Level Design(LLD) of Dropbox System Design
A lot of people assume designing a Dropbox is that all they just need to do is to use some cloud services, upload the file, and download the file whenever they want but that’s not how it works. The core problem is “Where and how to save the files? “. Suppose you want to share a file that can be of any size (small or big) and you upload it into the cloud.

---

Everything is fine till here but later if you have to make an update in your file then it’s not a good idea to edit the file and upload the whole file again and again into the cloud. The reason is:

---

The synchronization service receives the request from the request queue of the messaging services and updates the metadata database with the latest changes.
Also, the synchronization service broadcast the latest update to the other clients (if there are multiple clients) through the response queue so that the other client’s indexer can fetch back the chunks from the cloud storage and recreate the files with the latest update.
It also updates the local database with the information stored in the Metadata Database. If a client is not connected to the internet or offline for some time, it polls the system for new updates as soon as it goes online.
4.5. Cloud Storage

---

design-dropbox-2

Let’s assume we have a client installed on our computer (an app installed on your computer) and this client has 4 basic components. These basic components are Watcher, Chunker, Indexer, and Internal DB. We have considered only one client but there can be multiple clients belonging to the same user with the same basic components.

---

Request

GET /api/v1/objects?local_object_id=<Max object_id present locally>&device_id=<Unique Device Id>
X-API-Key: api_key
Authorization: auth_token
Response

200 OK
{
  new_objects: [
    {
      object_id:
      object_type:
      name:
      chunk_ids: [
        chunk1,
        chunk2,
        chunk3
      ]
    }
  ]
}
Meta Service will check the database and return an array of objects containing name of object, object id, object type and an array of chunk_ids. Client calls the Download Chunk API with these chunk_ids to download the chunks and reconstruct the file.

---

We are creating n number of response queues for n number of clients because the message will be deleted from the queue once it will be received by the client and we need to share the updated message with the various subscribed clients.
4.4. Synchronization Service
The client communicates with the synchronization services either to receive the latest update from the cloud storage or to send the latest request/updates to the Cloud Storage.

---

Scaling can be achieved using techniques such as vertical scaling (increasing hardware capabilities) or horizontal scaling (adding more machines).
However, horizontal scaling for relational databases often involves complexities, especially in scenarios with high read and write operations.
4.2.2 Database Sharding:
Database sharding is a horizontal partitioning technique where a large database is divided into smaller, more manageable parts called shards.

---

It gives a notification to the indexer and chunker if any action is performed in the files or folders.
Chunker breaks the files into multiple small pieces called chunks and uploads them to the cloud storage with a unique id or hash of these chunks.
To recreate the files these chunks can be joined together. For any changes in the files, the chunking algorithm detects the specific chunk which is modified and only saves that specific part/chunk to the cloud storage.
It reduces bandwidth usage, synchronization time, and storage space in the cloud.
Indexer is responsible for updating the internal database when it receives the notification from the watcher (for any action performed in folders/files).

---

You just need to save the chunk which is updated (this will take less memory and time). It will be easier to keep the different versions of the files in various chunks.
We have considered one file which is divided into various chunks. If there are multiple files then we need to know which chunks belong to which file.
To keep this information we will create one more file named a metadata file. This file contains the indexes of the chunks (chunk names and order information).
You need to mention the hash of the chunks (or some reference) in this metadata file and you need to sync this file into the cloud. We can download the metadata file from the cloud whenever we want and we can recreate the file using various chunks.

---

Now let’s talk about the various components for the complete low level design solution of the Dropbox.

6. API Design for Dropbox System Design
6.1 Download Chunk
This API would be used to download the chunk of a file.

Request

GET /api/v1/chunks/:chunk_id
X-API-Key: api_key
Authorization: auth_token
Response

---

The total number of users = 500 million.
Total number of daily active users = 100 million
The average number of files stored by each user = 200
The average size of each file = 100 KB
Total number of active connections per minute = 1 million

Storage Estimations:

Total number of files = 500 million * 200 = 100 billion
Total storage required = 100 billion * 100 KB = 10 PB

We would like to have a tool that can handle these use cases.
# response:Based on your requirements and constraints, it seems you are looking for an open source database solution with specific capabilities such as handling complex queries (e.g., hierarchical data), supporting geospatial functions, offering JSON/JSONB support, providing high availability through replication across zones or regions, ensuring durability during failures, and managing scalable storage costs efficiently while maintaining good performance metrics like latency.

Here are some open source database solutions that may meet your needs:

1. **Cassandra (Amazon DynamoDB)**: Amazon's managed service for Apache Cassandra offers high availability, durability across zones/regions, and automatic replication of data to provide low-latency access even during failures. It handles complex queries well but might require custom code or additional tools like Spark SQL for hierarchical querying (e.g., Nested Aggregations).

2. **CockroachDB**: This is a full-featured, transactional database with strong consistency that scales horizontally to meet your availability and durability requirements without requiring manual intervention or custom scripts for scaling. It supports geospatial data types natively which can be helpful in applications like mapping services where spatial queries are necessary (e.g., `ST_DISTANCE`).

3. **PostgreSQL with PostGIS**: While not open source, Amazon's managed service of RDS for Postgres provides features such as automatic failover and multi-AZ support which can help achieve high availability without manual scripts or tools needed to handle it on your own (e.g., `pg_rewind`). If you decide against using a cloud provider database solution, the open source version supports geospatial data types with PostGIS extensions for full functionality including spatial queries (`ST_DISTANCE`) and other GIS features that may not be available in plain old SQL databases like MySQL or MariaDB.

4. **MariaDB**: This is an excellent alternative to Oracle if you're looking at open source solutions, offering a wide range of storage engines (like InnoDB which supports JSON/JSONB data types), strong performance capabilities for read and write operations with features such as row-level locking that can help in maintaining high availability. It also has good geospatial support when used together with external tools like PostGIS or GeoMesa, if needed (e.g., spatial indexing).

5. **TimescaleDB**: A time series database built on top of PostgreSQL that specializes in handling large volumes and high-velocity data efficiently which can be useful for tracking metrics over intervals like daily usage statistics or geospatial information such as user activity heatmaps (e.g., `ST_DISTANCE`).

6. **MongoDB**: Another open source NoSQL database that offers JSON/BSON support and scalability, though it's not primarily designed for complex hierarchical data handling like relational databases or graph processing systems might be more suitable (e.g., ArangoDB). It provides good horizontal scaling options but may require additional tools such as Sharding to distribute the load across multiple servers efficiently if you have large datasets with high write volume and need fast read performance for geospatial queries.

When choosing a database, consider your current system's architecture (e.g., RDS vs EC2 instances), whether full-text search capabilities are required (`PG_CLUSTER` could help automate failovers in PostgreSQL without the use of scripts or manual intervention). Moreover, always test with representative data and queries to ensure that your chosen database meets all requirements for latency (e.g., subsecond responses) under high load conditions before fully migrating away from Oracle RDS on EC2 instances.

Remember that while some open source databases like MariaDB or PostgreSQL might provide native geospatial capabilities, additional tools such as GeoMesa or PyWren can be employed to handle specialized tasks including handling complex hierarchical data and enabling the ability for parallel writes (which is critical in an analytics environment with large datasets). These add-ons extend your database's functionality beyond native offerings.

Please note that while AWS RDS PostgreSQL has good automated failover capabilities, if you want to maintain a higher level of control over scaling operations and ensure automatic scripting without relying on cloud provider tools (e.g., for setting up replication across zones/regions), exploring other solutions like Amazon Aurora Serverless or CockroachDB might be necessary.

It's also important to note that while AWS RDS can offer a managed service, it may come with higher operational overhead compared to self-managed databases (e.g., PostgreSQL). With this in mind, consider whether the ease of management provided by Amazon Aurora or other cloud services is worth any additional costs associated with using those features.

In terms of cost efficiency and scalability for large datasets that require frequent read/write operations like geospatial data tracking systems (e.g., Google Maps heatmaps), a solution such as TimescaleDB might be the most appropriate because it provides both relational database management system capabilities along with time-series analysis features, which can efficiently handle high write volumes and provide fast queries for analytics tasks.

Ultimately, you may want to start by testing various databases against your specific needs before making a final decision on migration as each will have its own set of strengths in different scenarios (e.g., PostgreSQL excels at complex querying). If the performance and availability requirements are critical for applications like Google Maps heatmap, you might want to look into specialized databases such as Couchbase or MongoDB that excel with non-relational data structures but can also handle high volumes of read/write operations effectively.

Remember: Always evaluate your specific use case in detail before making a decision on database migration from Oracle RDS instances (EC2) because there's no one size fits all solution when it comes to databases and their scaling capabilities, features set or performance characteristics; what works for you may not work as effectively elsewhere.

# response:Based on your requirements and constraints, it seems you are looking for an open source database solution with specific capabilities such as handling complex queries (e.g., hierarchical data), supporting geospatial functions, offering JSON/JSONB support, providing high availability through replication across zones or regions, ensuring durability during failures, and managing scalable storage costs efficiently while maintaining good performance metrics like latency.

Here are some open source database solutions that may meet your needs:

1. **Cassandra (Amazon DynamoDB)**: Amazon's managed service for Apache Cassandra offers high availability, durability across zones/regions, and automatic replication of data to provide low-latency access even during failures. It handles complex queries well but might require custom code or additional tools like Spark SQL for hierarchical querying (e.g., Nested Aggregations).

2. **CockroachDB**: This is a full-featured, transactional database with strong consistency that scales horizontally to meet your availability and durability requirements without requiring manual intervention or custom scripts for scaling. It supports geospatial data types natively which can be helpful in applications like mapping services where spatial queries are necessary (e.g., `ST_DISTANCE`).

3. **PostgreSQL with PostGIS**: While not open source, Amazon's managed service of RDS for Postgres provides features such as automatic failover and multi-AZ support which can help achieve high availability without manual scripts or tools needed to handle it on your own (e.g., `pg_rewind`). If you decide against using a cloud provider database solution, the open source version supports geospatial data types with PostGIS extensions for full functionality including spatial queries (`ST_DISTANCE`) and other GIS features that may not be available in plain old SQL databases like MySQL or MariaDB.

4. **MariaDB**: This is an excellent alternative to Oracle if you're looking at open source solutions, offering a wide range of storage engines (like InnoDB which supports JSON/JSONB data types), strong performance capabilities for read and write operations with features such as row-level locking that can help in maintaining high availability. It also has good geospatial support when used together with external tools like PostGIS or GeoMesa, if needed (e.g., spatial indexing).

5. **TimescaleDB**: A time series database built on top of PostgreSQL that specializes in handling large volumes and high-velocity data efficiently which can be useful for tracking metrics over intervals like daily usage statistics or geospatial information such as user activity heatmaps (e.g., `ST_DISTANCE`).

6. **MongoDB**: Another open source NoSQL database that offers JSON/BSON support and scalability, though it's not primarily designed for complex hierarchical data handling like relational databases or graph processing systems might be more suitable (e.g., ArangoDB). It provides good horizontal scaling options but may require additional tools such as Sharding to distribute the load across multiple servers efficiently if you have large datasets with high write volume and need fast read performance for geospatial queries.

When choosing a database, consider your current system's architecture (e.g., RDS vs EC2 instances), whether full-text search capabilities are required (`PG_CLUSTER` could help automate failovers in PostgreSQL without the use of scripts or manual intervention). Moreover, always test with representative data and queries to ensure that your chosen database meets all requirements for latency (e.g., subsecond responses) under high load conditions before fully migrating away from Oracle RDS on EC2 instances.

Remember that while some open source databases like MariaDB or PostgreSQL might provide native geospatial capabilities, additional tools such as GeoMesa or PyWren can be employed to handle specialized tasks including handling complex hierarchical data and enabling the ability for parallel writes (which is critical in an analytics environment with large datasets). These add-ons extend your database's functionality beyond native offerings.

Please note that while AWS RDS PostgreSQL has good automated failover capabilities, if you want to maintain a higher level of control over scaling operations and ensure automatic scripting without relying on cloud provider tools (e.g., for setting up replication across zones/regions), exploring other solutions like Amazon Aurora Serverless or CockroachDB might be necessary.

It's also important to note that while AWS RDS can offer a managed service, it may come with higher operational overhead compared to self-managed databases (e.g., PostgreSQL). With this in mind, consider whether the ease of management provided by Amazon Aurora or other cloud services is worth any additional costs associated with using those features.

In terms of cost efficiency and scalability for large datasets that require frequent read/write operations like geospatial data tracking systems (e.g., Google Maps heatmaps), a solution such as TimescaleDB might be the most appropriate because it provides both relational database management system capabilities along with time-series analysis features, which can efficiently handle high write volumes and provide fast queries for analytics tasks.

Ultimately, you may want to start by testing various databases against your specific needs before making a final decision on migration as each will have its own set of strengths in different scenarios (e.g., PostgreSQL excels at complex querying). If the performance and availability requirements are critical for applications like Google Maps heatmap, you might want to look into specialized databases such as Couchbase or MongoDB that excel with non-relational data structures but can also handle high volumes of read/write operations effectively.

Remember: Always evaluate your specific use case in detail before making a decision on database migration from Oracle RDS instances (EC2) because there's no one size fits all solution when it comes to databases and their scaling capabilities, features set or performance characteristics; what works for you may not work as effectively elsewhere.",No,No
