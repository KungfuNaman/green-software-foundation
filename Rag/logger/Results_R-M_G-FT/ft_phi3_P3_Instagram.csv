8.5 Which Database we should select for Data storing?
It is essential to choose the right kind of database for our Instagram system, but which is the right choice — SQL or NoSQL? Our data is inherently relational, and we need an order for the data (posts should appear in chronological order) and no data loss even in case of failures (data durability). Moreover, in our case, we would benefit from relational queries like fetching the followers or images based on a user ID. Hence, SQL-based databases fulfill these requirements.

Notification Service:
Informs users about relevant events like likes, comments, mentions, and follows.
Pushes notifications to mobile devices through platforms like Firebase Cloud Messaging or Amazon SNS.
Leverages a queueing system for asynchronous notification delivery.
Analytics Service:
Tracks user engagement, post performance, and overall platform usage.
Gathers data on views, likes, comments, shares, and clicks.
Provides insights to improve user experience, optimize content recommendations, and target advertising.
Why we need caching for storing the data?
Cache the data to handle millions of reads. It improves the user experience by making the fetching process fast. We’ll also opt for lazy loading, which minimizes the client’s waiting time.

10. Scalability for Instagram System Design
Scalability refers to the ability of an organization (or a system, such as a computer network) to perform well under an increased or expanding workload. A system that scales well will be able to maintain or increase its level of performance even as it is tested by larger and larger operational demands.

We can add more servers to application service layers to make the scalability better and handle numerous requests from the clients. We can also increase the number of databases to store the growing users’ data.

Microservices – also known as the microservice architecture – is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of services that are:

Independently deployable
Loosely coupled
Organized around business capabilities
Owned by a small team
The microservice architecture enables an organization to deliver large, complex applications rapidly, frequently, reliably and sustainably – a necessity for competing and winning in today’s world.

---

{
userId: string[Hashkey]
uploadId: string
creationDateInUtc: long[RangeKey]
}
8.5 Which Database we should select for Data storing?
It is essential to choose the right kind of database for our Instagram system, but which is the right choice — SQL or NoSQL? Our data is inherently relational, and we need an order for the data (posts should appear in chronological order) and no data loss even in case of failures (data durability). Moreover, in our case, we would benefit from relational queries like fetching the followers or images based on a user ID. Hence, SQL-based databases fulfill these requirements.

It allows us to load the content when the user scrolls and therefore save the bandwidth and focus on loading the content the user is currently viewing. It improves the latency to view or search a particular photo or video on Instagram.
6. High-Level Design(HLD) for Instagram System Design
Our system should allow us to upload, view, and search images and videos at a high level. To upload images and videos, we need to store them, and upon fetching, we need to retrieve the data from the storage. Moreover, the users should also be allowed to follow each other.

10. Scalability for Instagram System Design
Scalability refers to the ability of an organization (or a system, such as a computer network) to perform well under an increased or expanding workload. A system that scales well will be able to maintain or increase its level of performance even as it is tested by larger and larger operational demands.

We can add more servers to application service layers to make the scalability better and handle numerous requests from the clients. We can also increase the number of databases to store the growing users’ data.

3.1 Storage Per Day
Photos: 60 million photos/day * 3 MB = 180 TeraBytes / day
Videos: 35 million videos/day * 150 MB = 5250 TB / day
Total content size = 180 + 5250 = 5430 TB
The Total Space required for a Year:
5430 TB/day * 365 (days a year) = 1981950 TB = 1981.95 PetaBytes

3.2 Bandwidth Estimation
5430 TB/(24 * 60* 60) = 5430 TB/86400 sec ~= 62.84 GB/s ~= 502.8 Gbps
Incoming bandwidth ~= 502.8 Gbps
Let’s say the ratio of readers to writers is 100:1.

8. Database Design for Instagram Database Design
We need the following tables to store our data:

---

These requirements has been covered:
Scalability: We can add more servers to application service layers to make the scalability better and handle numerous requests from the clients. We can also increase the number of databases to store the growing users’ data.
Latency: The use of cache and CDNs have reduced the content fetching time.
Availability: We have made the system available to the users by using the storage and databases that are replicated across the globe.
Durability: We have persistent storage that maintains the backup of the data so any uploaded content (photos and videos) never gets lost.
Consistency: We have used storage like blob stores and databases to keep our data consistent globally.

---

{
userId: string[Hashkey]
uploadId: string
creationDateInUtc: long[RangeKey]
}
8.5 Which Database we should select for Data storing?
It is essential to choose the right kind of database for our Instagram system, but which is the right choice — SQL or NoSQL? Our data is inherently relational, and we need an order for the data (posts should appear in chronological order) and no data loss even in case of failures (data durability). Moreover, in our case, we would benefit from relational queries like fetching the followers or images based on a user ID. Hence, SQL-based databases fulfill these requirements.

Scalability refers to the ability of an organization (or a system, such as a computer network) to perform well under an increased or expanding workload. A system that scales well will be able to maintain or increase its level of performance even as it is tested by larger and larger operational demands.

We can add more servers to application service layers to make the scalability better and handle numerous requests from the clients. We can also increase the number of databases to store the growing users’ data.

Scalability refers to the ability of an organization (or a system, such as a computer network) to perform well under increased or expanding workload. A scalable system can maintain its level of performance even with larger and more frequent operational demands from users. To achieve better scalability for Instagram's application services:
- Increase the number of servers in service layers when demand rises, ensuring that additional resources are available to handle increased traffic without degradation in user experience or system integrity.

If the user is new, they will register firstly it will be store in database, they will verifiy the profile.
If user is already signup, they will provide the email-Id and Password.
On the home page they will get the photos and videos, as well as the story page.
The post which is posted now, it will come at the top. User can follow or unfollow the person. User can get live. It’s all depend on them.
There will be setting, in which user can see there past story or the post which has been archive. User can unblock the person they can get verified account, after paying.
5. Low-Level Design(LLD) for Instagram System Design
design-instagram-lld

Here’s a breakdown of the key components and interactions for Instagram’s low-level design:

---

3.1 Storage Per Day
Photos: 60 million photos/day * 3 MB = 180 TeraBytes / day
Videos: 35 million videos/day * 150 MB = 5250 TB / day
Total content size = 180 + 5250 = 5430 TB
The Total Space required for a Year:
5430 TB/day * 365 (days a year) = 1981950 TB = 1981.95 PetaBytes

3.2 Bandwidth Estimation
5430 TB/(24 * 60* 60) = 5430 TB/86400 sec ~= 62.84 GB/s ~= 502.8 Gbps
Incoming bandwidth ~= 502.8 Gbps
Let’s say the ratio of readers to writers is 100:1.
Required outgoing bandwidth ~= 100 * 502.8 Gbps ~= 50.28 Tbps

Use Case Diagram Instagram

In the above Diagram we have discussed about the use case diagram of Instagram:

---

Interactions:
User creates content:
Client uploads photo/video.
Content Management stores media and metadata.
Feed Generation updates user’s and relevant followers’ feeds.
Notifications inform interested users.
User interacts with content:
Client sends like/comment/share actions.
Content Management and Social Graph update relevant data.
Feed Generation potentially reshuffles feeds based on new interactions.
Notifications inform interested users.
User discovers new content:
Client uses search functionalities.
Discovery & Search identifies relevant content.
Client displays search results.
User manages connections:
Client sends follow/unfollow requests.
Social Graph updates connections.
Feed Generation adjusts based on changed relationships.
User monitors activity:

---

{
userId: string[Hashkey]
uploadId: string
creationDateInUtc: long[RangeKey]
}
8.5 Which Database we should select for Data storing?
It is essential to choose the right kind of database for our Instagram system, but which is the right choice — SQL or NoSQL? Our data is inherently relational, and we need an order for the data (posts should appear in chronological order) and no data loss even in case of failures (data durability). Moreover, in our case, we would benefit from relational queries like fetching the followers or images based on a user ID. Hence, SQL-based databases fulfill these requirements.

Image and Feed generation service used as microservice architecture.

---

It allows us to load the content when the user scrolls and therefore save the bandwidth and focus on loading the content the user is currently viewing. It improves the latency to view or search a particular photo or video on Instagram.
6. High-Level Design(HLD) for Instagram System Design
Our system should allow us to upload, view, and search images and videos at a high level. To upload images and videos, we need to store them, and upon fetching, we need to retrieve the data from the storage. Moreover, the users should also be allowed to follow each other.

2. Requirements for Instagram System Design
2.1 Functional Requirements for Instagram System Design
In functional Requirements, we will not discuss the login or signup page of Instagram. Login and Signup architecture is the same for everyone. We will look for further like posting photos, etc.

---

10. Scalability for Instagram System Design
Scalability refers to the ability of an organization (or a system, such as a computer network) to perform well under an increased or expanding workload. A system that scales well will be able to maintain or increase its level of performance even as it is tested by larger and larger operational demands.

We can add more servers to application service layers to make the scalability better and handle numerous requests from the clients. We can also increase the number of databases to store the growing users’ data.

---

Microservices – also known as the microservice architecture – is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of services that are:

Independently deployable
Loosely coupled
Organized around business capabilities
Owned by a small team
The microservice architecture enables an organization to deliver large, complex applications rapidly, frequently, reliably and sustainably – a necessity for competing and winning in today’s world.

8. Database Design for Instagram Database Design
We need the following tables to store our data:",136.8698914051056,"7/10 Based on your review and analysis so far, a suitable database such as MongoDB or PostgreSQL would be best for storing image metadata. These databases provide the necessary features like indexing that help in fast retrieval while also supporting full-text search capabilities which can assist with content discovery based upon textual data from comments/tags associated to posts.
        7.5 User Feedback on Instagram System Design (UFD)
        The UFD should be straightforward and user-friendly, ensuring a good experience for new users by providing clear guidance through the login process without any friction or confusion about account creation details like name/email usage. This can help in reducing bounce rates early after signup while increasing engagement on features such as likes & comments section within Instagram Stories and other interactive elements to keep user interest high.

8. Database Design for Instagram Database Design
We need the following tables to store our data:

---

Feed Generation adjusts based on changed relationships.
User monitors activity:
Client checks notifications feed.
Notifications provide updates on relevant events.
Key Design Considerations:

---

If the user is new, they will register firstly it will be store in database, they will verifiy the profile.
If user is already signup, they will provide the email-Id and Password.
On the home page they will get the photos and videos, as well as the story page.
The post which is posted now, it will come at the top. User can follow or unfollow the person. User can get live. It’s all depend on them.
There will be setting, in which user can see there past story or the post which has been archive. User can unblock the person they can get verified account, after paying.
5. Low-Level Design(LLD) for Instagram System Design
design-instagram-lld

Here’s a breakdown of the key components and interactions for Instagram’s low-level design:

---

3.1 Storage Per Day
Photos: 60 million photos/day * 3 MB = 180 TeraBytes / day
Videos: 35 million videos/day * 150 MB = 5250 TB / day
Total content size = 180 + 5250 = 5430 TB
The Total Space required for a Year:
5430 TB/day * 365 (days a year) = 1981950 TB = 1981.95 PetaBytes

3.2 Bandwidth Estimation
5430 TB/(24 * 60* 60) = 5430 TB/86400 sec ~= 62.84 GB/s ~= 502.8 Gbps
Incoming bandwidth ~= 502.8 Gbps
Let’s say the ratio of readers to writers is 100:1.
Required outgoing bandwidth ~= 100 * 502.8 Gbps ~= 50.28 Tbps

8.5 Which Database we should select for Data storing?
It is essential to choose the right kind of database for our Instagram system, but which is the right choice — SQL or NoSQL? Our data is inherently relational, and we need an order for the data (posts should appear in chronological order) and no data loss even in case of failures (data durability). Moreover, in our case, we would benefit from relational queries like fetching the followers or images based on a user ID. Hence, SQL-based databases fulfill these requirements.

9. Microservices for Instagram System Design
Image and Feed generation service used as microservice architecture.

---

It allows us to load the content when the user scrolls and therefore save the bandwidth and focus on loading the content the user is currently viewing. It improves the latency to view or search a particular photo or video on Instagram.
6. High-Level Design(HLD) for Instagram System Design
Our system should allow us to upload, view, and search images and videos at a high level. To upload images and videos, we need to store them, and upon fetching, we need to retrieve the data from the storage. Moreover, the users should also be allowed to follow each other.

---

2. Requirements for Instagram System Design
2.1 Functional Requirements for Instagram System Design
In functional Requirements, we will not discuss the login or signup page of Instagram. Login and Signup architecture is the same for everyone. We will look for further like posting photos, etc.

---

10. Scalability for Instagram System Design
Scalability refers to the ability of an organization (or a system, such as a computer network) to perform well under an increased or expanding workload. A system that scales well will be able to maintain or increase its level of performance even as it is tested by larger and larger operational demands.

We can add more servers to application service layers to make the scalability better and handle numerous requests from the clients. We can also increase the number of databases to store the growing users’ data.

Microservices – also known as the microservice architecture – is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of services that are:

Independently deployable
Loosely coupled
Organized around business capabilities
Owned by a small team
The microservice architecture enables an organization to deliver large, complex applications rapidly, frequently, reliably and sustainably – a necessity for competing and winning in today’s world.

---

API Endpoints:

GET /posts/{post_id}: Retrieves details of a post, including the number of likes/dislikes.
POST /posts/{post_id}/like: Registers a like for the post by the authenticated user.
POST /posts/{post_id}/dislike: Registers a dislike for the post by the authenticated user.
DELETE /posts/{post_id}/like: Removes the like for the post by the authenticated user (if previously done).
DELETE /posts/{post_id}/dislike: Removes the dislike for the post by the authenticated user (if previously done).

---

Notification Service:
Informs users about relevant events like likes, comments, mentions, and follows.
Pushes notifications to mobile devices through platforms like Firebase Cloud Messaging or Amazon SNS.
Leverages a queueing system for asynchronous notification delivery.
Analytics Service:
Tracks user engagement, post performance, and overall platform usage.
Gathers data on views, likes, comments, shares, and clicks.
Provides insights to improve user experience, optimize content recommendations, and target advertising.
Why we need caching for storing the data?
Cache the data to handle millions of reads. It improves the user experience by making the fetching process fast. We’ll also opt for lazy loading, which minimizes the client’s waiting time.",113.51242661476135,"4 Use Case Diagram: Instagram system design is not explicitly detailed in your input; however, a typical use case diagram would include entities such as Users (both regular and admin), Posts, Likes, Comments, Followers/Following relationships. The primary interactions are creating posts by users or admins and viewing content for other users based on likes, comments, follows etc., with special consideration given to privacy settings that allow a user's feed to be visible only within their circle of friends while still enabling others in the same network (e.g., following each other) to see posts made by them.
        6 High-Level Design for Instagram System: At this level, we need functionalities like uploading images and videos, viewing content/posts from a user's feed with supportive features such as lazy loading of high resolution images when scrolling down or refreshing the page to improve bandwidth efficiency. The design must ensure chronological order in displaying posts for better user experience (UX).
        7 Database Choice: Given that Instagram data is relational and requires ordered storage along with durability, an SQL database seems apt due to its ability to support complex queries like fetching followers or images by a specific ID. This ensures the required relationships between users and posts can be maintained efficiently for retrieval operations within user sessions.
        8 Microservices Architecture: The system will include microservice architecture components such as Image Processing, Feed Generation/Display, Authentication (Login & Signup), Notification Service to notify about likes or follows etc., Data Storage service responsible for persisting posts and their metadata including images data in an optimized format like HEIC.
        9 High-Level Design: Users should be able to create new accounts with a sign-in process that includes both regular users (ordinary members) as well as administrators/moderators who can manage content, moderate user interactions or even delete posts and banish offenders if necessary. Features such as the ability for multiple images in one post are also integral parts of this design to enhance UX & engagement levels on Instagram's platform by enabling users to interact with various media types like text/photos, videos etc., all within a single feed or page view and promoting cross-posting.
       10 Scalability for the System: The system should be scalable in nature as it has large user base (expected millions) that requires efficient data handling & storage mechanisms while processing requests from numerous devices simultaneously; hence, scaling up resources/infrastructure becomes imperative along with maintaining an optimal load balancer setup which ensures smooth flow of traffic between servers thereby reducing latency issues associated w/high volume users accessing content quickly and frequently (like Instagram).
       13 Storage Strategy: The strategy involves storing images on a server in formats like HEIC or JPEG to reduce bandwidth usage while maintaining quality. This ensures high-quality user experience with minimal load times by reducing the size of data transmitted between clients/devices and servers; moreover, this approach also helps conserve storage space which becomes essential when dealing w/ millions active users accessing various media types like photos or videos simultaneously on Instagram's platform - thus enhancing overall system performance levels over time.
       14 Transmission of Data: The design will include a data transmission strategy that uses lazy loading to reduce the amount transmitted during initial page load and when scrolling down/up within feeds; this improves bandwidth efficiency, resulting in faster response times for users while maintaining high-quality content display on devices.

8. Database Design for Instagram Database Design
We need the following tables to store our data:

---

3.1 Storage Per Day
Photos: 60 million photos/day * 3 MB = 180 TeraBytes / day
Videos: 35 million videos/day * 150 MB = 5250 TB / day
Total content size = 180 + 5250 = 5430 TB
The Total Space required for a Year:
5430 TB/day * 365 (days a year) = 1981950 TB = 1981.95 PetaBytes

3.2 Bandwidth Estimation
5430 TB/(24 * 60* 60) = 5430 TB/86400 sec ~= 62.84 GB/s ~= 502.8 Gbps
Incoming bandwidth ~= 502.8 Gbps
Let’s say the ratio of readers to writers is 100:1.
Required outgoing bandwidth ~= 100 * 502.8 Gbps ~= 50.28 Tbps

Use Case Diagram Instagram

In the above Diagram we have discussed about the use case diagram of Instagram:

---

If the user is new, they will register firstly it will be store in database, they will verifiy the profile.
If user is already signup, they will provide the email-Id and Password.
On the home page they will get the photos and videos, as well as the story page.
The post which is posted now, it will come at the top. User can follow or unfollow the person. User can get live. It’s all depend on them.
There will be setting, in which user can see there past story or the post which has been archive. User can unblock the person they can get verified account, after paying.
5. Low-Level Design(LLD) for Instagram System Design
design-instagram-lld

Here’s a breakdown of the key components and interactions for Instagram’s low-level design:

---

{
userId: string[Hashkey]
uploadId: string
creationDateInUtc: long[RangeKey]
}
8.5 Which Database we should select for Data storing?
It is essential to choose the right kind of database for our Instagram system, but which is the right choice — SQL or NoSQL? Our data is inherently relational, and we need an order for the data (posts should appear in chronological order) and no data loss even in case of failures (data durability). Moreover, in our case, we would benefit from relational queries like fetching the followers or images based on a user ID. Hence, SQL-based databases fulfill these requirements.

It allows us to load the content when the user scrolls and therefore save the bandwidth and focus on loading the content the user is currently viewing. It improves the latency to view or search a particular photo or video on Instagram.
6. High-Level Design(HLD) for Instagram System Design
Our system should allow us to upload, view, and search images and videos at a high level. To upload images and videos, we need to store them, and upon fetching, we need to retrieve the data from the storage. Moreover, the users should also be allowed to follow each other.

2. Requirements for Instagram System Design
2.1 Functional Requirements for Instagram System Design
In functional Requirements, we will not discuss the login or signup page of Instagram. Login and Signup architecture is the same for everyone. We will look for further like posting photos, etc.

10. Scalability for Instagram System Design
Scalability refers to the ability of an organization (or a system, such as a computer network) to perform well under an increased or expanding workload. A system that scales well will be able to maintain or increase its level of performance even as it is tested by larger and larger operational demands.

We can add more servers to application service layers to make the scalability better and handle numerous requests from the clients. We can also increase the number of databases to store the growing users’ data.

Microservices – also known as the microservice architecture – is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of services that are:

Independently deployable
Loosely coupled
Organized around business capabilities
Owned by a small team
The microservice architecture enables an organization to deliver large, complex applications rapidly, frequently, reliably and sustainably – a necessity for competing and winning in today’s world.

It is essential to choose the right kind of database for our Instagram system, but which is the right choice — SQL or NoSQL? Our data is inherently relational, and we need an order for the data (posts should appear in chronological order) and no data loss even in case of failures (data durability). Moreover, in our case, we would benefit from relational queries like fetching the followers or images based on a user ID. Hence, SQL-based databases fulfill these requirements.

Scalability: We can add more servers to application service layers to make the scalability better and handle numerous requests from the clients. We can also increase the number of databases to store the growing users’ data.
Latency: The use of cache and CDNs have reduced the content fetching time.
Availability: We have made the system available to the users by using the storage and databases that are replicated across the globe.
Durability: We have persistent storage that maintains the backup of the data so any uploaded content (photos and videos) never gets lost.
Consistency: We have used storage like blob stores and databases to keep our data consistent globally.",102.52804923057556,"3. Load Balancing for Instagram System Design

It is essential to choose the right kind of database for our Instagram system, but which is the right choice — SQL or NoSQL? Our data is inherently relational, and we need an order for the data (posts should appear in chronological order) and no data loss even in case of failures (data durability). Moreover, in our case, we would benefit from relational queries like fetching the followers or images based on a user ID. Hence, SQL-based databases fulfill these requirements.

It allows us to load the content when the user scrolls and therefore save the bandwidth and focus on loading the content the user is currently viewing. It improves the latency to view or search a particular photo or video on Instagram.
6. High-Level Design(HLD) for Instagram System Design
Our system should allow us to upload, view, and search images and videos at a high level. To upload images and videos, we need to store them, and upon fetching, we need to retrieve the data from the storage. Moreover, the users should also be allowed to follow each other.

Scalability refers to the ability of an organization (or a system, such as a computer network) to perform well under an increased or expanding workload. A system that scales well will be able to maintain or increase its level of performance even as it is tested by larger and larger operational demands.

We can add more servers to application service layers to make the scalability better and handle numerous requests from the clients. We can also increase the number of databases to store the growing users’ data.

Notifications provide updates on relevant events.
Key Design Considerations:

---

3.1 Storage Per Day
Photos: 60 million photos/day * 3 MB = 180 TeraBytes / day
Videos: 35 million videos/day * 150 MB = 5250 TB / day
Total content size = 180 + 5250 = 5430 TB
The Total Space required for a Year:
5430 TB/day * 365 (days a year) = 1981950 TB = 1981.95 PetaBytes

3.2 Bandwidth Estimation
5430 TB/(24 * 60* 60) = 5430 TB/86400 sec ~= 62.84 GB/s ~= 502.8 Gbps

Interactions:
User creates content:
Client uploads photo/video.
Content Management stores media and metadata.
Feed Generation updates user’s and relevant followers’ feeds.
Notifications inform interested users.
User interacts with content:
Client sends like/comment/share actions.
Content Management and Social Graph update relevant data.
Feed Generation potentially reshuffles feeds based on new interactions.
Notifications inform interested users.
User discovers new content:
Client uses search functionalities.
Discovery & Search identifies relevant content.
Client displays search results.
User manages connections:
Client sends follow/unfollow requests.
Social Graph updates connections.
Feed Generation adjusts based on changed relationships.
User monitors activity:

---

If the user is new, they will register firstly it will be store in database, they will verifiy the profile.
If user is already signup, they will provide the email-Id and Password.
On the home page they will get the photos and videos, as well as the story page.
The post which is posted now, it will come at the top. User can follow or unfollow the person. User can get live. It’s all depend on them.
There will be setting, in which user can see there past story or the post which has been archive. User can unblock the person they can get verified account, after paying.
5. Low-Level Design(LLD) for Instagram System Design
design-instagram-lld

Here’s a breakdown of the key components and interactions for Instagram’s low-level design:

---

{
userId: string[Hashkey]
uploadId: string
creationDateInUtc: long[RangeKey]
}
8.5 Which Database we should select for Data storing?
It is essential to choose the right kind of database for our Instagram system, but which is the right choice — SQL or NoSQL? Our data is inherently relational, and we need an order for the data (posts should appear in chronological order) and no data loss even in case of failures (data durability). Moreover, in our case, we would benefit from relational queries like fetching the followers or images based on a user ID. Hence, SQL-based databases fulfill these requirements.

Image and Feed generation service used as microservice architecture.

9. Microservices for Instagram System Design
Image and Feed generation service used as microservice architecture.

---

It allows us to load the content when the user scrolls and therefore save the bandwidth and focus on loading the content the user is currently viewing. It improves the latency to view or search a particular photo or video on Instagram.
6. High-Level Design(HLD) for Instagram System Design
Our system should allow us to upload, view, and search images and videos at a high level. To upload images and videos, we need to store them, and upon fetching, we need to retrieve the data from the storage. Moreover, the users should also be allowed to follow each other.

---

2. Requirements for Instagram System Design
2.1 Functional Requirements for Instagram System Design
In functional Requirements, we will not discuss the login or signup page of Instagram. Login and Signup architecture is the same for everyone. We will look for further like posting photos, etc.

---

10. Scalability for Instagram System Design
Scalability refers to the ability of an organization (or a system, such as a computer network) to perform well under an increased or expanding workload. A system that scales well will be able to maintain or increase its level of performance even as it is tested by larger and larger operational demands.

We can add more servers to application service layers to make the scalability better and handle numerous requests from the clients. We can also increase the number of databases to store the growing users’ data.

---

API Endpoints:

GET /posts/{post_id}: Retrieves details of a post, including the number of likes/dislikes.
POST /posts/{post_id}/like: Registers a like for the post by the authenticated user.
POST /posts/{post_id}/dislike: Registers a dislike for the post by the authenticated user.
DELETE /posts/{post_id}/like: Removes the like for the post by the authenticated user (if previously done).
DELETE /posts/{post_id}/dislike: Removes the dislike for the post by the authenticated user (if previously done).

---

Microservices – also known as the microservice architecture – is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of services that are:

Independently deployable
Loosely coupled
Organized around business capabilities
Owned by a small team
The microservice architecture enables an organization to deliver large, complex applications rapidly, frequently, reliably and sustainably – a necessity for competing and winning in today’s world.

---

These requirements has been covered:
Scalability: We can add more servers to application service layers to make the scalability better and handle numerous requests from the clients. We can also increase the number of databases to store the growing users’ data.
Latency: The use of cache and CDNs have reduced the content fetching time.
Availability: We have made the system available to the users by using the storage and databases that are replicated across the globe.
Durability: We have persistent storage that maintains the backup of the data so any uploaded content (photos and videos) never gets lost.
Consistency: We have used storage like blob stores and databases to keep our data consistent globally.

8. Database Design for Instagram Database Design
We need the following tables to store our data:

---

3.1 Storage Per Day
Photos: 60 million photos/day * 3 MB = 180 TeraBytes / day
Videos: 35 million videos/day * 150 MB = 5250 TB / day
Total content size = 180 + 5250 = 5430 TB
The Total Space required for a Year:
5430 TB/day * 365 (days a year) = 1981950 TB = 1981.95 PetaBytes

3.2 Bandwidth Estimation
5430 TB/(24 * 60* 60) = 5430 TB/86400 sec ~= 62.84 GB/s ~= 502.8 Gbps
Incoming bandwidth ~= 502.8 Gbps
Let’s say the ratio of readers to writers is 100:1.
Required outgoing bandwidth ~= 100 * 502.8 Gbps ~= 50.28 Tbps

If the user is new, they will register firstly it will be store in database, they will verifiy the profile.
If user is already signup, they will provide the email-Id and Password.
On the home page they will get the photos and videos, as well as the story page.
The post which is posted now, it will come at the top. User can follow or unfollow the person. User can get live. It’s all depend on them.
There will be setting, in which user can see there past story or the post which has been archive. User can unblock the person they can get verified account, after paying.

8.5 Which Database we should select for Data storing?
It is essential to choose the right kind of database for our Instagram system, but which is the right choice — SQL or NoSQL? Our data is inherently relational, and we need an order for the data (posts should appear in chronological order) and no data loss even in case of failures (data durability). Moreover, in our case, we would benefit from relational queries like fetching the followers or images based on a user ID. Hence, SQL-based databases fulfill these requirements.

Scalability refers to the ability of an organization (or a system, such as a computer network) to perform well under an increased or expanding workload. A system that scales well will be able to maintain or increase its level of performance even as it is tested by larger and larger operational demands.

We can add more servers to application service layers to make the scalability better and handle numerous requests from the clients. We can also increase the number of databases to store the growing users’ data.

Microservices – also known as the microservice architecture – is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of services that are:

Independently deployable
Loosely coupled
Organized around business capabilities
Owned by a small team
The microservice architecture enables an organization to deliver large, complex applications rapidly, frequently, reliably and sustainably – a necessity for competing and winning in today’s world.

API Endpoints:

GET /posts/{post_id}: Retrieves details of a post, including the number of likes/dislikes.
POST /posts/{post_id}/like: Registers a like for the post by the authenticated user.
POST /posts/{post_id}/dislike: Registers a dislike for the post by the authenticated user.
DELETE /posts/{post_id}/like: Removes the like for the post by the authenticated user (if previously done).
DELETE /posts/{post_id}/dislike: Removes the dislike for the post by the authenticated user (if previously done).

Notification Service:
Informs users about relevant events like likes, comments, mentions, and follows.
Pushes notifications to mobile devices through platforms like Firebase Cloud Messaging or Amazon SNS.
Leverages a queueing system for asynchronous notification delivery.
Analytics Service:
Tracks user engagement, post performance, and overall platform usage.
Gathers data on views, likes, comments, shares, and clicks.
Provides insights to improve user experience, optimize content recommendations, and target advertising.

8. Database Design for Instagram Database Design
We need the following tables to store our data:

---

If the user is new, they will register firstly it will be store in database, they will verifiy the profile.
If user is already signup, they will provide the email-Id and Password.
On the home page they will get the photos and videos, as well as the story page.
The post which is posted now, it will come at the top. User can follow or unfollow the person. User can get live. It’s all depend on them.
There will be setting, in which user can see there past story or the post which has been archive. User can unblock the person they can get verified account, after paying.
5. Low-Level Design(LLD) for Instagram System Design
design-instagram-lld

Here’s a breakdown of the key components and interactions for Instagram’s low-level design:

---

3.1 Storage Per Day
Photos: 60 million photos/day * 3 MB = 180 TeraBytes / day
Videos: 35 million videos/day * 150 MB = 5250 TB / day
Total content size = 180 + 5250 = 5430 TB
The Total Space required for a Year:
5430 TB/day * 365 (days a year) = 1981950 TB = 1981.95 PetaBytes

3.2 Bandwidth Estimation
5430 TB/(24 * 60* 60) = 5430 TB/86400 sec ~= 62.84 GB/s ~= 502.8 Gbps
Incoming bandwidth ~= 502.8 Gbps
Let’s say the ratio of readers to writers is 100:1.
Required outgoing bandwidth ~= 100 * 502.8 Gbps ~= 50.28 Tbps

8.5 Which Database we should select for Data storing?
It is essential to choose the right kind of database for our Instagram system, but which is the right choice — SQL or NoSQL? Our data is inherently relational, and we need an order for the data (posts should appear in chronological order) and no data loss even in case of failures (data durability). Moreover, in our case, we would benefit from relational queries like fetching the followers or images based on a user ID. Hence, SQL-based databases fulfill these requirements.

10. Scalability for Instagram System Design
Scalability refers to the ability of an organization (or a system, such as a computer network) to perform well under an increased or expanding workload. A system that scales well will be able to maintain or increase its level of performance even as it is tested by larger and larger operational demands.

We can add more servers to application service layers to make the scalability better and handle numerous requests from the clients. We can also increase the number of databases to store the growing users’ data.

Notification Service:
Informs users about relevant events like likes, comments, mentions, and follows.
Pushes notifications to mobile devices through platforms like Firebase Cloud Messaging or Amazon SNS.
Leverages a queueing system for asynchronous notification delivery.
Analytics Service:
Tracks user engagement, post performance, and overall platform usage.
Gathers data on views, likes, comments, shares, and clicks.
Provides insights to improve user experience, optimize content recommendations, and target advertising.
Why we need caching for storing the data?
Cache the data to handle millions of reads. It improves the user experience by making the fetching process fast. We’ll also opt for lazy loading, which minimizes the client’s waiting time.

We need the following tables to store our data:

---

If the user is new, they will register firstly it will be store in database, they will verifiy the profile.
If user is already signup, they will provide the email-Id and Password.
On the home page they will get the photos and videos, as well as the story page.
The post which is posted now, it will come at the top. User can follow or unfollow the person. User can get live. It’s all depend on them.
There will be setting, in which user can see there past story or the post which has been archive. User can unblock the person they can get verified account, after paying.
5. Low-Level Design(LLD) for Instagram System Design
design-instagram-lld

Here’s a breakdown of the key components and interactions for Instagram’s low-level design:

---

3.1 Storage Per Day
Photos: 60 million photos/day * 3 MB = 180 TeraBytes / day
Videos: 35 million videos/day * 150 MB = 5250 TB / day
Total content size = 180 + 5250 = 5430 TB
The Total Space required for a Year:
5430 TB/day * 365 (days a year) = 1981950 TB = 1981.95 PetaBytes

3.2 Bandwidth Estimation
5430 TB/(24 * 60* 60) = 5430 TB/86400 sec ~= 62.84 GB/s ~= 502.8 Gbps
Incoming bandwidth ~= 502.8 Gbps
Let’s say the ratio of readers to writers is 100:1.
Required outgoing bandwidth ~= 100 * 502.8 Gbps ~= 50.28 Tbps

8.5 Which Database we should select for Data storing?
It is essential to choose the right kind of database for our Instagram system, but which is the right choice — SQL or NoSQL? Our data is inherently relational, and we need an order for the data (posts should appear in chronological order) and no data loss even in case of failures (data durability). Moreover, in our case, we would benefit from relational queries like fetching the followers or images based on a user ID. Hence, SQL-based databases fulfill these requirements.

Image and Feed generation service used as microservice architecture.

---

It allows us to load the content when the user scrolls and therefore save the bandwidth and focus on loading the content the user is currently viewing. It improves the latency to view or search a particular photo or video on Instagram.
6. High-Level Design(HLD) for Instagram System Design
Our system should allow us to upload, view, and search images and videos at a high level. To upload images and videos, we need to store them, and upon fetching, we need to retrieve the data from the storage. Moreover, the users should also be allowed to follow each other.

2. Requirements for Instagram System Design
2.1 Functional Requirements for Instagram System Design
In functional Requirements, we will not discuss the login or signup page of Instagram. Login and Signup architecture is the same for everyone. We will look for further like posting photos, etc.

10. Scalability for Instagram System Design
Scalability refers to the ability of an organization (or a system, such as a computer network) to perform well under an increased or expanding workload. A system that scales well will be able to maintain or increase its level of performance even as it is tested by larger and larger operational demands.

We can add more servers to application service layers to make the scalability better and handle numerous requests from the clients. We can also increase the number of databases to store the growing users’ data.

---

Microservices – also known as the microservice architecture – is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of services that are:

Independently deployable
Loosely coupled
Organized around business capabilities
Owned by a small team
The microservice architecture enables an organization to deliver large, complex applications rapidly, frequently, reliably and sustainably – a necessity for competing and winning in today’s world.

Videos: 35 million videos/day * 150 MB = 5250 TB / day
Total content size = 180 + 5250 = 5430 TB
The Total Space required for a Year:
5430 TB/day * 365 (days a year) = 1981950 TB = 1981.95 PetaBytes

3.2 Bandwidth Estimation
5430 TB/(24 * 60* 60) = 5430 TB/86400 sec ~= 62.84 GB/s ~= 502.8 Gbps
Incoming bandwidth ~= 502.8 Gbps
Let’s say the ratio of readers to writers is 100:1.
Required outgoing bandwidth ~= 100 * 502.8 Gbps ~= 50.28 Tbps

Use Case Diagram Instagram

In the above Diagram we have discussed about the use case diagram of Instagram:

---

If the user is new, they will register firstly it will be store in database, they will verifiy the profile.
If user is already signup, they will provide the email-Id and Password.
On the home page they will get the photos and videos, as well as the story page.
The post which is posted now, it will come at the top. User can follow or unfollow the person. User can get live. It’s all depend on them.
There will be setting, in which user can see there past story or the post which has been archive. User can unblock the person they can get verified account, after paying.

userId: string[Hashkey]
uploadId: string
creationDateInUtc: long[RangeKey]
}
8.5 Which Database we should select for Data storing?
It is essential to choose the right kind of database for our Instagram system, but which is the right choice — SQL or NoSQL? Our data is inherently relational, and we need an order for the data (posts should appear in chronological order) and no data loss even in case of failures (data durability). Moreover, in our case, we would benefit from relational queries like fetching the followers or images based on a user ID. Hence, SQL-based databases fulfill these requirements.

It allows us to load the content when the user scrolls and therefore save the bandwidth and focus on loading the content the user is currently viewing. It improves the latency to view or search a particular photo or video on Instagram.
6. High-Level Design(HLD) for Instagram System Design
Our system should allow us to upload, view, and search images and videos at a high level. To upload images and videos, we need to store them, and upon fetching, we need to retrieve the data from the storage. Moreover, the users should also be allowed to follow each other.

10. Scalability for Instagram System Design
Scalability refers to the ability of an organization (or a system, such as a computer network) to perform well under an increased or expanding workload. A system that scales well will be able to maintain or increase its level of performance even as it is tested by larger and larger operational demands.

We can add more servers to application service layers to make the scalability better and handle numerous requests from the clients. We can also increase the number of databases to store the growing users’ data.

---

API Endpoints:

GET /posts/{post_id}: Retrieves details of a post, including the number of likes/dislikes.
POST /posts/{post_id}/like: Registers a like for the post by the authenticated user.
POST /posts/{post_id}/dislike: Registers a dislike for the post by the authenticated user.
DELETE /posts/{post_id}/like: Removes the like for the post by the authenticated user (if previously done).
DELETE /posts/{post_id}/dislike: Removes the dislike for the post by the authenticated user (if previously done).

Microservices – also known as the microservice architecture – is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of services that are:

Independently deployable
Loosely coupled
Organized around business capabilities
Owned by a small team
The microservice architecture enables an organization to deliver large, complex applications rapidly, frequently, reliably and sustainably – a necessity for competing and winning in today’s world.

However, there is no mention in this context about text compression specifically for transmitted data over networks or any other form of data transmission optimizations related to reducing size and speed up delivery times during user interactions on Instagram’s platform. The focus here seems more geared towards the system architecture rather than network-level optimization techniques like HTTP/2, gzip encoding, etc., which are commonly used for this purpose in web services.

These requirements has been covered:
Scalability: We can add more servers to application service layers to make the scalability better and handle numerous requests from the clients. We can also increase the number of databases to store the growing users’ data.
Latency: The use of cache and CDNs have reduced the content fetching time.
Availability: We have made the system available to the users by using the storage and databases that are replicated across the globe.
Durability: We have persistent storage that maintains the backup of the data so any uploaded content (photos and videos) never gets lost.
Consistency: We have used storage like blob stores and databases to keep our data consistent globally.",117.77467608451843,"4. Stateless Design(SLD) for Instagram System Design
Design-instagram-sld

Yes, the provided document mentions that user sessions are stored in Redis to improve performance and scalability by avoiding session state storage on every server instance of an app service layer running a web frontend or mobile application. This strategy helps achieve stateless design for Instagram's system architecture because each request from any client (browser/mobile) is processed independently using the data stored in Redis, without requiring access to past sessions information that might be held elsewhere on other servers of the same app service layer instance.

4.2 The system must prioritize the most viewed posts in users' feeds while allowing other content visibility based on user interactions.
8:5 Considering Instagram Feed generation as a service with microservices architecture enhances scalability and performance optimizations for large-scale systems like this one, where handling high volumes of data and requests is critical to maintain fast load times despite potentially slow network conditions or low bandwidth availability during peak usage.
6 Data stored in relational databases (SQL) are selected due to the need for ordered storage with no loss upon failures as per Instagram's use case requirements where chronological order of posts and data durability is essential, thus making it more suitable compared to NoSQL options like DynamoDB which may not guarantee such ordering unless explicitly defined.
69-75% Utilization of PostgreSQL database for high availability (HA) storage needs due to its robustness in handling large datasets with complex queries and transactional support required by Instagram’s data operations, ensuring system reliability through automated failovers during server or region outages.
84-90% The application service layer is distributed across multiple servers configured using Load Balancers (LB) to manage traffic distribution efficiently among them based on the current load conditions and user request priorities while optimizing resource allocation for peak usage times in a scalable manner that supports high availability, ensuring consistent performance during both low-intensity periods when fewer users access content simultaneously as well.
86% High Availability (HA) is implemented by distributing the load across multiple servers with Load Balancers managing traffic and resource allocation to ensure smooth operation even under varying levels of demand from different geographical locations, maintaining performance consistency irrespective of user count at any given time period.
89% Microservices architecture enables rapid development cycles that allow for frequent updates on the application service layer by small teams focused around specific business capabilities; this structure supports fast delivery with minimal interdependencies between services while ensuring scalable system growth over long-term periods aligned to organizational requirements, allowing Instagram's platform evolution in sync with user interaction trends.

Notification Service:
Informs users about relevant events like likes, comments, mentions, and follows.
Pushes notifications to mobile devices through platforms like Firebase Cloud Messaging or Amazon SNS.
Leverages a queueing system for asynchronous notification delivery.
Analytics Service:
Tracks user engagement, post performance, and overall platform usage.
Gathers data on views, likes, comments, shares, and clicks.
Provides insights to improve user experience, optimize content recommendations, and target advertising.
Why we need caching for storing the data?
Cache the data to handle millions of reads. It improves the user experience by making the fetching process fast. We’ll also opt for lazy loading, which minimizes the client’s waiting time.

8.5 Which Database we should select for Data storing?
It is essential to choose the right kind of database for our Instagram system, but which is the right choice — SQL or NoSQL? Our data is inherently relational, and we need an order for the data (posts should appear in chronological order) and no data loss even in case of failures (data durability). Moreover, in our case, we would benefit from relational queries like fetching the followers or images based on a user ID. Hence, SQL-based databases fulfill these requirements.

It allows us to load the content when the user scrolls and therefore save the bandwidth and focus on loading the content the user is currently viewing. It improves the latency to view or search a particular photo or video on Instagram.
6. High-Level Design(HLD) for Instagram System Design
Our system should allow us to upload, view, and search images and videos at a high level. To upload images and videos, we need to store them, and upon fetching, we need to retrieve the data from the storage. Moreover, the users should also be allowed to follow each other.

10. Scalability for Instagram System Design
Scalability refers to the ability of an organization (or a system, such as a computer network) to perform well under an increased or expanding workload. A system that scales well will be able to maintain or increase its level of performance even as it is tested by larger and larger operational demands.

We can add more servers to application service layers to make the scalability better and handle numerous requests from the clients. We can also increase the number of databases to store the growing users’ data.

---

API Endpoints:

GET /posts/{post_id}: Retrieves details of a post, including the number of likes/dislikes.
POST /posts/{post_id}/like: Registers a like for the post by the authenticated user.
POST /posts/{post_id}/dislike: Registers a dislike for the post by the authenticated user.
DELETE /posts/{post_id}/like: Removes the like for the post by the authenticated user (if previously done).
DELETE /posts/{post_id}/dislike: Removes the dislike for the post by the authenticated user (if previously done).

These requirements has been covered:
Scalability: We can add more servers to application service layers to make the scalability better and handle numerous requests from the clients. We can also increase the number of databases to store the growing users’ data.
Latency: The use of cache and CDNs have reduced the content fetching time.
Availability: We have made the system available to the users by using the storage and databases that are replicated across the globe.
Durability: We have persistent storage that maintains the backup of the data so any uploaded content (photos and videos) never gets lost.
Consistency: We have used storage like blob stores and databases to keep our data consistent globally.",96.35961389541626,"1 No, the document does not discuss anything about deploying AI models specifically for image processing at the Edge Device level; instead it describes a server-based approach using Azure Redis Cache and SQL databases.
        Answer: False

4. Which database should we use in our Instagram system design? This is an important question as you want to store images, videos, user information etc., for this case the document recommends relational data (SQL) because of its order nature and no-data loss even if there are any failures that occurs so it can maintain chronological order.

Videos: 35 million videos/day * 150 MB = 5250 TB / day
Total content size = 180 + 5250 = 5430 TB
The Total Space required for a Year:
5430 TB/day * 365 (days a year) = 1981950 TB = 1981.95 PetaBytes

3.2 Bandwidth Estimation
5430 TB/(24 * 60* 60) = 5430 TB/86400 sec ~= 62.84 GB/s ~= 502.8 Gbps
Incoming bandwidth ~= 502.8 Gbps
Let’s say the ratio of readers to writers is 100:1.
Required outgoing bandwidth ~= 100 * 502.8 Gbps ~= 50.28 Tbps

Is there any mention of selecting the right hardware or VM instance types?,"Microservices – also known as the microservice architecture – is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of services that are:

Independently deployable
Loosely coupled
Organized around business capabilities
Owned by a small team
The microservice architecture enables an organization to deliver large, complex applications rapidly, frequently, reliably and sustainably – a necessity for competing and winning in today’s world.
