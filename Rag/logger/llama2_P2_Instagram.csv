5. Low-Level Design(LLD) for Instagram System Design
design-instagram-lld

Here’s a breakdown of the key components and interactions for Instagram’s low-level design:
---
Feed Generation adjusts based on changed relationships.
User monitors activity:
Client checks notifications feed.
Notifications provide updates on relevant events.
Key Design Considerations:
---
3.1 Storage Per Day
Photos: 60 million photos/day * 3 MB = 180 TeraBytes / day
Videos: 35 million videos/day * 150 MB = 5250 TB / day
Total content size = 180 + 5250 = 5430 TB
The Total Space required for a Year:
5430 TB/day * 365 (days a year) = 1981950 TB = 1981.95 PetaBytes

3.2 Bandwidth Estimation
5430 TB/(24 * 60* 60) = 5430 TB/86400 sec ~= 62.84 GB/s ~= 502.8 Gbps
Incoming bandwidth ~= 502.8 Gbps
Let’s say the ratio of readers to writers is 100:1.
Required outgoing bandwidth ~= 100 * 502.8 Gbps ~= 50.28 Tbps

}
data = {
    ""filters"": {
        ""mediaTypes"": [""PHOTO"", ""VIDEO""]  # Search for both photos and videos
    }
}
response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=data)
 
if response.status_code == 200:
    results = response.json()
    # Process the search results
else:
    print(""Error:"", response.status_code, response.text)
8. Database Design for Instagram Database Design
We need the following tables to store our data:
---
{
userId: string[Hashkey]
uploadId: string
creationDateInUtc: long[RangeKey]
}
8.5 Which Database we should select for Data storing?
It is essential to choose the right kind of database for our Instagram system, but which is the right choice — SQL or NoSQL? Our data is inherently relational, and we need an order for the data (posts should appear in chronological order) and no data loss even in case of failures (data durability). Moreover, in our case, we would benefit from relational queries like fetching the followers or images based on a user ID. Hence, SQL-based databases fulfill these requirements.

Image and Feed generation service used as microservice architecture.
---
It allows us to load the content when the user scrolls and therefore save the bandwidth and focus on loading the content the user is currently viewing. It improves the latency to view or search a particular photo or video on Instagram.
6. High-Level Design(HLD) for Instagram System Design
Our system should allow us to upload, view, and search images and videos at a high level. To upload images and videos, we need to store them, and upon fetching, we need to retrieve the data from the storage. Moreover, the users should also be allowed to follow each other.

2. Requirements for Instagram System Design
2.1 Functional Requirements for Instagram System Design
In functional Requirements, we will not discuss the login or signup page of Instagram. Login and Signup architecture is the same for everyone. We will look for further like posting photos, etc.
---
10. Scalability for Instagram System Design
Scalability refers to the ability of an organization (or a system, such as a computer network) to perform well under an increased or expanding workload. A system that scales well will be able to maintain or increase its level of performance even as it is tested by larger and larger operational demands.

We can add more servers to application service layers to make the scalability better and handle numerous requests from the clients. We can also increase the number of databases to store the growing users’ data.
---
Microservices – also known as the microservice architecture – is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of services that are:

Independently deployable
Loosely coupled
Organized around business capabilities
Owned by a small team
The microservice architecture enables an organization to deliver large, complex applications rapidly, frequently, reliably and sustainably – a necessity for competing and winning in today’s world.

API Endpoints:

GET /posts/{post_id}: Retrieves details of a post, including the number of likes/dislikes.
POST /posts/{post_id}/like: Registers a like for the post by the authenticated user.
POST /posts/{post_id}/dislike: Registers a dislike for the post by the authenticated user.
DELETE /posts/{post_id}/like: Removes the like for the post by the authenticated user (if previously done).
DELETE /posts/{post_id}/dislike: Removes the dislike for the post by the authenticated user (if previously done).

These requirements has been covered:
Scalability: We can add more servers to application service layers to make the scalability better and handle numerous requests from the clients. We can also increase the number of databases to store the growing users’ data.
Latency: The use of cache and CDNs have reduced the content fetching time.
Availability: We have made the system available to the users by using the storage and databases that are replicated across the globe.

Notification Service:
Informs users about relevant events like likes, comments, mentions, and follows.
Pushes notifications to mobile devices through platforms like Firebase Cloud Messaging or Amazon SNS.
Leverages a queueing system for asynchronous notification delivery.
Analytics Service:
Tracks user engagement, post performance, and overall platform usage.
Gathers data on views, likes, comments, shares, and clicks.
Provides insights to improve user experience, optimize content recommendations, and target advertising.
Why we need caching for storing the data?
Cache the data to handle millions of reads. It improves the user experience by making the fetching process fast. We’ll also opt for lazy loading, which minimizes the client’s waiting time.
---
Availability: The system should be highly available.
Durability: Any uploaded content (photos and videos) should never get lost.
Consistency: We can compromise a little on consistency. It is acceptable if the content (photos or videos) takes time to show in followers’ feeds located in a distant region.
Reliability: The system must be able to tolerate hardware and software failures.
3. Capacity Estimation for Instagram System Design
We have 1 billion users, with 500 million as daily active users. Assume 60 million photos and 35 million videos are shared on Instagram per day. We can consider 3 MB as the maximum size of each photo and 150 MB as the maximum size of each video uploaded on Instagram.On average, each user sends 20 requests (of any type) per day to our service.

---
If the user is new, they will register firstly it will be store in database, they will verifiy the profile.
If user is already signup, they will provide the email-Id and Password.
On the home page they will get the photos and videos, as well as the story page.
The post which is posted now, it will come at the top. User can follow or unfollow the person. User can get live. It’s all depend on them.
There will be setting, in which user can see there past story or the post which has been archive. User can unblock the person they can get verified account, after paying.
5. Low-Level Design(LLD) for Instagram System Design

Here’s a breakdown of the key components and interactions for Instagram’s low-level design:
---
url = ""https://photoslibrary.googleapis.com/v1/mediaItems:search""
headers = {
    ""Authorization"": ""Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN""  # Replace with your access token
}
data = {
    ""filters"": {

    }
}
response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=data)
 
if response.status_code == 200:
    results = response.json()
    # Process the search results
else:
    print(""Error:"", response.status_code, response.text)
8. Database Design for Instagram Database Design
We need the following tables to store our data:
---
3.1 Storage Per Day
Photos: 60 million photos/day * 3 MB = 180 TeraBytes / day
Videos: 35 million videos/day * 150 MB = 5250 TB / day
Total content size = 180 + 5250 = 5430 TB
The Total Space required for a Year:
5430 TB/day * 365 (days a year) = 1981950 TB = 1981.95 PetaBytes

3.2 Bandwidth Estimation
5430 TB/(24 * 60* 60) = 5430 TB/86400 sec ~= 62.84 GB/s ~= 502.8 Gbps
Incoming bandwidth ~= 502.8 Gbps
Let’s say the ratio of readers to writers is 100:1.
Required outgoing bandwidth ~= 100 * 502.8 Gbps ~= 50.28 Tbps

8.5 Which Database we should select for Data storing?
It is essential to choose the right kind of database for our Instagram system, but which is the right choice — SQL or NoSQL? Our data is inherently relational, and we need an order for the data (posts should appear in chronological order) and no data loss even in case of failures (data durability). Moreover, in our case, we would benefit from relational queries like fetching the followers or images based on a user ID. Hence, SQL-based databases fulfill these requirements.

It allows us to load the content when the user scrolls and therefore save the bandwidth and focus on loading the content the user is currently viewing. It improves the latency to view or search a particular photo or video on Instagram.
6. High-Level Design(HLD) for Instagram System Design
Our system should allow us to upload, view, and search images and videos at a high level. To upload images and videos, we need to store them, and upon fetching, we need to retrieve the data from the storage. Moreover, the users should also be allowed to follow each other.

2.1 Functional Requirements for Instagram System Design
In functional Requirements, we will not discuss the login or signup page of Instagram. Login and Signup architecture is the same for everyone. We will look for further like posting photos, etc.

10. Scalability for Instagram System Design
Scalability refers to the ability of an organization (or a system, such as a computer network) to perform well under an increased or expanding workload. A system that scales well will be able to maintain or increase its level of performance even as it is tested by larger and larger operational demands.

We can add more servers to application service layers to make the scalability better and handle numerous requests from the clients. We can also increase the number of databases to store the growing users’ data.

We need the following tables to store our data:
---
If the user is new, they will register firstly it will be store in database, they will verifiy the profile.
If user is already signup, they will provide the email-Id and Password.
On the home page they will get the photos and videos, as well as the story page.
The post which is posted now, it will come at the top. User can follow or unfollow the person. User can get live. It’s all depend on them.

5. Low-Level Design(LLD) for Instagram System Design
design-instagram-lld

Here’s a breakdown of the key components and interactions for Instagram’s low-level design:
---
3.1 Storage Per Day
Photos: 60 million photos/day * 3 MB = 180 TeraBytes / day
Videos: 35 million videos/day * 150 MB = 5250 TB / day
Total content size = 180 + 5250 = 5430 TB
The Total Space required for a Year:
5430 TB/day * 365 (days a year) = 1981950 TB = 1981.95 PetaBytes

3.2 Bandwidth Estimation
5430 TB/(24 * 60* 60) = 5430 TB/86400 sec ~= 62.84 GB/s ~= 502.8 Gbps
Incoming bandwidth ~= 502.8 Gbps
Let’s say the ratio of readers to writers is 100:1.
Required outgoing bandwidth ~= 100 * 502.8 Gbps ~= 50.28 Tbps

8.5 Which Database we should select for Data storing?
It is essential to choose the right kind of database for our Instagram system, but which is the right choice — SQL or NoSQL? Our data is inherently relational, and we need an order for the data (posts should appear in chronological order) and no data loss even in case of failures (data durability). Moreover, in our case, we would benefit from relational queries like fetching the followers or images based on a user ID. Hence, SQL-based databases fulfill these requirements.

It allows us to load the content when the user scrolls and therefore save the bandwidth and focus on loading the content the user is currently viewing. It improves the latency to view or search a particular photo or video on Instagram.
6. High-Level Design(HLD) for Instagram System Design
Our system should allow us to upload, view, and search images and videos at a high level. To upload images and videos, we need to store them, and upon fetching, we need to retrieve the data from the storage. Moreover, the users should also be allowed to follow each other.

10. Scalability for Instagram System Design
Scalability refers to the ability of an organization (or a system, such as a computer network) to perform well under an increased or expanding workload. A system that scales well will be able to maintain or increase its level of performance even as it is tested by larger and larger operational demands.

We can add more servers to application service layers to make the scalability better and handle numerous requests from the clients. We can also increase the number of databases to store the growing users’ data.

Reliability: The system must be able to tolerate hardware and software failures.
3. Capacity Estimation for Instagram System Design
We have 1 billion users, with 500 million as daily active users. Assume 60 million photos and 35 million videos are shared on Instagram per day. We can consider 3 MB as the maximum size of each photo and 150 MB as the maximum size of each video uploaded on Instagram.On average, each user sends 20 requests (of any type) per day to our service.",2.3172178268432617,"Yes, in the ""Scalability"" section, it is mentioned that Instagram can add more servers to application service layers to make the scalability better and handle numerous requests from clients. Additionally, the number of databases can be increased to store growing users' data, which helps to scale up the system during periods of high traffic or growth.

To minimize resource usage during idle periods, Instagram can consider scaling down certain components of the system, such as reducing the number of servers or databases used when there are fewer requests. This approach is known as ""right-sizing"" and can help reduce costs and improve efficiency.

Our data is inherently relational, and we need an order for the data (posts should appear in chronological order) and no data loss even in case of failures (data durability). Moreover, in our case, we would benefit from relational queries like fetching the followers or images based on a user ID. Hence, SQL-based databases fulfill these requirements.

It allows us to load the content when the user scrolls and therefore save the bandwidth and focus on loading the content the user is currently viewing. It improves the latency to view or search a particular photo or video on Instagram.
6. High-Level Design(HLD) for Instagram System Design
Our system should allow us to upload, view, and search images and videos at a high level. To upload images and videos, we need to store them, and upon fetching, we need to retrieve the data from the storage. Moreover, the users should also be allowed to follow each other.

10. Scalability for Instagram System Design
Scalability refers to the ability of an organization (or a system, such as a computer network) to perform well under an increased or expanding workload. A system that scales well will be able to maintain or increase its level of performance even as it is tested by larger and larger operational demands.

We can add more servers to application service layers to make the scalability better and handle numerous requests from the clients. We can also increase the number of databases to store the growing users’ data.

Notification Service:
Informs users about relevant events like likes, comments, mentions, and follows.
Pushes notifications to mobile devices through platforms like Firebase Cloud Messaging or Amazon SNS.
Leverages a queueing system for asynchronous notification delivery.
Analytics Service:
Tracks user engagement, post performance, and overall platform usage.
Gathers data on views, likes, comments, shares, and clicks.
Provides insights to improve user experience, optimize content recommendations, and target advertising.
Why we need caching for storing the data?
Cache the data to handle millions of reads. It improves the user experience by making the fetching process fast. We’ll also opt for lazy loading, which minimizes the client’s waiting time.

3.1 Storage Per Day
Photos: 60 million photos/day * 3 MB = 180 TeraBytes / day
Videos: 35 million videos/day * 150 MB = 5250 TB / day
Total content size = 180 + 5250 = 5430 TB
The Total Space required for a Year:
5430 TB/day * 365 (days a year) = 1981950 TB = 1981.95 PetaBytes

3.2 Bandwidth Estimation
5430 TB/(24 * 60* 60) = 5430 TB/86400 sec ~= 62.84 GB/s ~= 502.8 Gbps
Incoming bandwidth ~= 502.8 Gbps
Let’s say the ratio of readers to writers is 100:1.
Required outgoing bandwidth ~= 100 * 502.8 Gbps ~= 50.28 Tbps

The author suggests using metrics such as CPU usage, memory usage, and network latency to adjust the number of replicas of a container in a Kubernetes deployment. This approach allows for more efficient use of resources and can help prevent over- or under-provisioning of compute resources.

The article also mentions the use of Kubernetes' built-in autoscaling feature, which can automatically adjust the number of replicas based on predetermined metrics such as CPU usage or memory usage. This allows for a more hands-off approach to scaling and can help ensure that the application is running at optimal levels of resources.

In addition, the author mentions using tools such as Prometheus and Grafana to monitor and analyze system metrics, which can help identify areas where resource usage can be optimized.

If the user is new, they will register firstly it will be store in database, they will verifiy the profile.
If user is already signup, they will provide the email-Id and Password.
On the home page they will get the photos and videos, as well as the story page.
The post which is posted now, it will come at the top. User can follow or unfollow the person. User can get live. It’s all depend on them.
There will be setting, in which user can see there past story or the post which has been archive. User can unblock the person they can get verified account, after paying.

Here’s a breakdown of the key components and interactions for Instagram’s low-level design:
---
{
userId: string[Hashkey]
uploadId: string
creationDateInUtc: long[RangeKey]
}
8.5 Which Database we should select for Data storing?
It is essential to choose the right kind of database for our Instagram system, but which is the right choice — SQL or NoSQL? Our data is inherently relational, and we need an order for the data (posts should appear in chronological order) and no data loss even in case of failures (data durability). Moreover, in our case, we would benefit from relational queries like fetching the followers or images based on a user ID. Hence, SQL-based databases fulfill these requirements.

It allows us to load the content when the user scrolls and therefore save the bandwidth and focus on loading the content the user is currently viewing. It improves the latency to view or search a particular photo or video on Instagram.
6. High-Level Design(HLD) for Instagram System Design
Our system should allow us to upload, view, and search images and videos at a high level. To upload images and videos, we need to store them, and upon fetching, we need to retrieve the data from the storage. Moreover, the users should also be allowed to follow each other.

2. Requirements for Instagram System Design
2.1 Functional Requirements for Instagram System Design
In functional Requirements, we will not discuss the login or signup page of Instagram. Login and Signup architecture is the same for everyone. We will look for further like posting photos, etc.

10. Scalability for Instagram System Design
Scalability refers to the ability of an organization (or a system, such as a computer network) to perform well under an increased or expanding workload. A system that scales well will be able to maintain or increase its level of performance even as it is tested by larger and larger operational demands.

We can add more servers to application service layers to make the scalability better and handle numerous requests from the clients. We can also increase the number of databases to store the growing users’ data.

Microservices – also known as the microservice architecture – is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of services that are:

Independently deployable
Loosely coupled
Organized around business capabilities
Owned by a small team
The microservice architecture enables an organization to deliver large, complex applications rapidly, frequently, reliably and sustainably – a necessity for competing and winning in today’s world.

5. Low-Level Design(LLD) for Instagram System Design
design-instagram-lld

Here’s a breakdown of the key components and interactions for Instagram’s low-level design:
---
url = ""https://photoslibrary.googleapis.com/v1/mediaItems:search""
headers = {
    ""Authorization"": ""Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN""  # Replace with your access token
}
data = {
    ""filters"": {
        ""mediaTypes"": [""PHOTO"", ""VIDEO""]  # Search for both photos and videos
    }
}
response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=data)
 
if response.status_code == 200:
    results = response.json()
    # Process the search results
else:
    print(""Error:"", response.status_code, response.text)
8. Database Design for Instagram Database Design
We need the following tables to store our data:
---
3.1 Storage Per Day
Photos: 60 million photos/day * 3 MB = 180 TeraBytes / day
Videos: 35 million videos/day * 150 MB = 5250 TB / day
Total content size = 180 + 5250 = 5430 TB
The Total Space required for a Year:
5430 TB/day * 365 (days a year) = 1981950 TB = 1981.95 PetaBytes

3.2 Bandwidth Estimation
5430 TB/(24 * 60* 60) = 5430 TB/86400 sec ~= 62.84 GB/s ~= 502.8 Gbps
Incoming bandwidth ~= 502.8 Gbps
Let’s say the ratio of readers to writers is 100:1.
Required outgoing bandwidth ~= 100 * 502.8 Gbps ~= 50.28 Tbps

8.5 Which Database we should select for Data storing?
It is essential to choose the right kind of database for our Instagram system, but which is the right choice — SQL or NoSQL? Our data is inherently relational, and we need an order for the data (posts should appear in chronological order) and no data loss even in case of failures (data durability). Moreover, in our case, we would benefit from relational queries like fetching the followers or images based on a user ID. Hence, SQL-based databases fulfill these requirements.

It allows us to load the content when the user scrolls and therefore save the bandwidth and focus on loading the content the user is currently viewing. It improves the latency to view or search a particular photo or video on Instagram.
6. High-Level Design(HLD) for Instagram System Design
Our system should allow us to upload, view, and search images and videos at a high level. To upload images and videos, we need to store them, and upon fetching, we need to retrieve the data from the storage. Moreover, the users should also be allowed to follow each other.

10. Scalability for Instagram System Design
Scalability refers to the ability of an organization (or a system, such as a computer network) to perform well under an increased or expanding workload. A system that scales well will be able to maintain or increase its level of performance even as it is tested by larger and larger operational demands.

We can add more servers to application service layers to make the scalability better and handle numerous requests from the clients. We can also increase the number of databases to store the growing users’ data.

Microservices – also known as the microservice architecture – is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of services that are:

Independently deployable
Loosely coupled
Organized around business capabilities

Notification Service:
Informs users about relevant events like likes, comments, mentions, and follows.
Pushes notifications to mobile devices through platforms like Firebase Cloud Messaging or Amazon SNS.
Leverages a queueing system for asynchronous notification delivery.
Analytics Service:
Tracks user engagement, post performance, and overall platform usage.
Gathers data on views, likes, comments, shares, and clicks.
Provides insights to improve user experience, optimize content recommendations, and target advertising.
Why we need caching for storing the data?
Cache the data to handle millions of reads. It improves the user experience by making the fetching process fast. We’ll also opt for lazy loading, which minimizes the client’s waiting time.

7.3 Like or Dislike posts
Designing an API for liking and disliking posts involves multiple considerations. Here’s a breakdown of key aspects to think about:

API Endpoints:",2.3055150508880615,"Based on the provided information, it seems that the Instagram system design is focused on scalability, availability, and performance. Here are some possible answers to your questions:

1. Scalability: To improve scalability, the system can use Kubernetes to schedule cron jobs during off-peak hours to optimize resource usage. This will allow the system to handle a large number of users and posts without overwhelming the servers. Additionally, the use of a distributed database like Apache Cassandra can help scale the system horizontally by adding more nodes as needed.
2. Latency: To reduce latency, the system can use cache and content delivery networks (CDNs) to store frequently accessed data closer to the users. This will reduce the distance the data has to travel, resulting in faster load times for users. Additionally, the use of a message queue like RabbitMQ can help distribute workloads across multiple servers, reducing the load on any one server and improving overall system performance.
3. Availability: To ensure availability, the system can use a distributed database that is replicated across multiple regions or availability zones. This will ensure that even in the event of a failure in one region or availability zone, the data will still be available from other sources. Additionally, the use of load balancers and autoscaling can help distribute workloads across multiple servers, reducing the risk of a single point of failure.
4. Durability: To ensure durability, the system can use a persistent storage solution like Amazon S3 or Google Cloud Storage to store uploaded content. This will ensure that even in the event of a failure, the content will still be available from the backup. Additionally, the use of a message queue like RabbitMQ can help distribute workloads across multiple servers, reducing the risk of a single point of failure.
5. Consistency: To ensure consistency, the system can use a distributed database that maintains consistent data across all regions or availability zones. This will ensure that even in the event of a failure in one region or availability zone, the data will still be consistent across other sources. Additionally, the use of a message queue like RabbitMQ can help distribute workloads across multiple servers, reducing the risk of a single point of failure.
6. Like or Dislike posts: To design an API for liking and disliking posts, the system can use a message queue like RabbitMQ to handle the likes and dislikes asynchronously. This will allow the system to handle a large number of likes and dislikes without overwhelming the servers.

5. Low-Level Design(LLD) for Instagram System Design
design-instagram-lld

Here’s a breakdown of the key components and interactions for Instagram’s low-level design:
---
3.1 Storage Per Day
Photos: 60 million photos/day * 3 MB = 180 TeraBytes / day
Videos: 35 million videos/day * 150 MB = 5250 TB / day
Total content size = 180 + 5250 = 5430 TB
The Total Space required for a Year:
5430 TB/day * 365 (days a year) = 1981950 TB = 1981.95 PetaBytes

3.2 Bandwidth Estimation
5430 TB/(24 * 60* 60) = 5430 TB/86400 sec ~= 62.84 GB/s ~= 502.8 Gbps
Incoming bandwidth ~= 502.8 Gbps
Let’s say the ratio of readers to writers is 100:1.
Required outgoing bandwidth ~= 100 * 502.8 Gbps ~= 50.28 Tbps

8. Database Design for Instagram Database Design
We need the following tables to store our data:
---
{
userId: string[Hashkey]
uploadId: string
creationDateInUtc: long[RangeKey]
}
8.5 Which Database we should select for Data storing?
It is essential to choose the right kind of database for our Instagram system, but which is the right choice — SQL or NoSQL? Our data is inherently relational, and we need an order for the data (posts should appear in chronological order) and no data loss even in case of failures (data durability). Moreover, in our case, we would benefit from relational queries like fetching the followers or images based on a user ID. Hence, SQL-based databases fulfill these requirements.

It allows us to load the content when the user scrolls and therefore save the bandwidth and focus on loading the content the user is currently viewing. It improves the latency to view or search a particular photo or video on Instagram.
6. High-Level Design(HLD) for Instagram System Design
Our system should allow us to upload, view, and search images and videos at a high level. To upload images and videos, we need to store them, and upon fetching, we need to retrieve the data from the storage. Moreover, the users should also be allowed to follow each other.

2. Requirements for Instagram System Design
2.1 Functional Requirements for Instagram System Design
In functional Requirements, we will not discuss the login or signup page of Instagram. Login and Signup architecture is the same for everyone. We will look for further like posting photos, etc.

10. Scalability for Instagram System Design
Scalability refers to the ability of an organization (or a system, such as a computer network) to perform well under an increased or expanding workload. A system that scales well will be able to maintain or increase its level of performance even as it is tested by larger and larger operational demands.

We can add more servers to application service layers to make the scalability better and handle numerous requests from the clients. We can also increase the number of databases to store the growing users’ data.
---
Availability: The system should be highly available.
Durability: Any uploaded content (photos and videos) should never get lost.
Consistency: We can compromise a little on consistency. It is acceptable if the content (photos or videos) takes time to show in followers’ feeds located in a distant region.
Reliability: The system must be able to tolerate hardware and software failures.
3. Capacity Estimation for Instagram System Design
We have 1 billion users, with 500 million as daily active users. Assume 60 million photos and 35 million videos are shared on Instagram per day. We can consider 3 MB as the maximum size of each photo and 150 MB as the maximum size of each video uploaded on Instagram.On average, each user sends 20 requests (of any type) per day to our service.
---
API Endpoints:

GET /posts/{post_id}: Retrieves details of a post, including the number of likes/dislikes.
POST /posts/{post_id}/like: Registers a like for the post by the authenticated user.
POST /posts/{post_id}/dislike: Registers a dislike for the post by the authenticated user.
DELETE /posts/{post_id}/like: Removes the like for the post by the authenticated user (if previously done).
DELETE /posts/{post_id}/dislike: Removes the dislike for the post by the authenticated user (if previously done).
---
These requirements has been covered:
Scalability: We can add more servers to application service layers to make the scalability better and handle numerous requests from the clients. We can also increase the number of databases to store the growing users’ data.
Latency: The use of cache and CDNs have reduced the content fetching time.
Availability: We have made the system available to the users by using the storage and databases that are replicated across the globe.
Durability: We have persistent storage that maintains the backup of the data so any uploaded content (photos and videos) never gets lost.
Consistency: We have used storage like blob stores and databases to keep our data consistent globally.

We can also increase the number of databases to store the growing users' data.""

Circuit breaker patterns are a design pattern used to handle service failures gracefully. The basic idea behind circuit breaker patterns is to introduce a ""breaker"" in the communication path between services, which can be triggered by a service failure. When the breaker is triggered, it stops further requests from being sent to the failed service, and waits for a certain period of time before allowing new requests to be sent. This helps prevent cascading failures and reduces the load on the failed service, allowing it to recover before accepting new requests.

5. Low-Level Design(LLD) for Instagram System Design
design-instagram-lld

Here’s a breakdown of the key components and interactions for Instagram’s low-level design:
---
3.1 Storage Per Day
Photos: 60 million photos/day * 3 MB = 180 TeraBytes / day
Videos: 35 million videos/day * 150 MB = 5250 TB / day
Total content size = 180 + 5250 = 5430 TB
The Total Space required for a Year:
5430 TB/day * 365 (days a year) = 1981950 TB = 1981.95 PetaBytes

3.2 Bandwidth Estimation
5430 TB/(24 * 60* 60) = 5430 TB/86400 sec ~= 62.84 GB/s ~= 502.8 Gbps
Incoming bandwidth ~= 502.8 Gbps
Let’s say the ratio of readers to writers is 100:1.
Required outgoing bandwidth ~= 100 * 502.8 Gbps ~= 50.28 Tbps

7.3 Like or Dislike posts
Designing an API for liking and disliking posts involves multiple considerations. Here’s a breakdown of key aspects to think about:

API Endpoints:",2.317626714706421,"Based on the provided requirements, it seems that Instagram is designed to handle a large number of users and content uploads, while ensuring high scalability, low latency, high availability, data durability, and consistency. Here are some key takeaways and potential design considerations for each requirement:

1. Scalability:
	* Use a distributed architecture to handle increased traffic and load.
	* Implement horizontal scaling by adding more servers or instances as needed.
	* Consider using cloud-based services, such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) or Google Cloud Platform (GCP), which provide automatic scaling features.
2. Latency:
	* Use a content delivery network (CDN) to cache frequently accessed content and reduce the distance between users and servers.
	* Implement caching layers within the application to store frequently accessed data.
	* Consider using a load balancer to distribute traffic across multiple servers.
3. Availability:
	* Use a distributed architecture to ensure that no single point of failure can bring down the entire system.
	* Implement redundancy and failover mechanisms for critical components, such as databases and storage.
	* Consider using cloud-based services that provide built-in high availability features.
4. Durability:
	* Use a persistent storage solution, such as a distributed database or a blob store, to ensure that uploaded content is not lost in case of failures.
	* Implement backups and snapshots to ensure data consistency across multiple servers.
5. Consistency:
	* Use a consistent hashing algorithm to distribute traffic across multiple servers.
	* Implement a distributed database that provides strong consistency guarantees.
6. Like or Dislike posts:
	* Consider using a separate API endpoint for liking and disliking posts, to keep the logic isolated and easier to maintain.
	* Use a token-based system to handle authentication and authorization of users to like or dislike posts.
	* Implement rate limiting to prevent excessive liking or disliking of posts.
7. Cloud-native network security tools and controls:
	* Consider using cloud-native network security tools, such as AWS WAF or GCP Load Balancing, to provide an additional layer of security for the Instagram system.
	* Implement network segmentation and access control lists (ACLs) to restrict access to sensitive components of the system.
	* Use encryption for data in transit and at rest to protect against unauthorized access.

In terms of adopting cloud-native network security tools and controls, it's essential to evaluate the specific security requirements of the Instagram system and determine which tools and controls are necessary to meet those requirements. Some potential considerations include:

1. Using AWS WAF or GCP Load Balancing to protect the API endpoint from common web attacks such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).
2. Implementing network segmentation using VPCs or subnets to isolate sensitive components of the system from the public internet.
3. Using encryption for data in transit and at rest to protect against unauthorized access.
4. Implementing access control lists (ACLs) to restrict access to sensitive components of the system.

    }
}
response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=data)
 
if response.status_code == 200:
    results = response.json()
    # Process the search results
else:
    print(""Error:"", response.status_code, response.text)
8. Database Design for Instagram Database Design
We need the following tables to store our data:
---
{
userId: string[Hashkey]
uploadId: string
creationDateInUtc: long[RangeKey]
}
8.5 Which Database we should select for Data storing?
It is essential to choose the right kind of database for our Instagram system, but which is the right choice — SQL or NoSQL? Our data is inherently relational, and we need an order for the data (posts should appear in chronological order) and no data loss even in case of failures (data durability). Moreover, in our case, we would benefit from relational queries like fetching the followers or images based on a user ID. Hence, SQL-based databases fulfill these requirements.

It allows us to load the content when the user scrolls and therefore save the bandwidth and focus on loading the content the user is currently viewing. It improves the latency to view or search a particular photo or video on Instagram.
6. High-Level Design(HLD) for Instagram System Design
Our system should allow us to upload, view, and search images and videos at a high level. To upload images and videos, we need to store them, and upon fetching, we need to retrieve the data from the storage. Moreover, the users should also be allowed to follow each other.

2. Requirements for Instagram System Design
2.1 Functional Requirements for Instagram System Design
In functional Requirements, we will not discuss the login or signup page of Instagram. Login and Signup architecture is the same for everyone. We will look for further like posting photos, etc.

10. Scalability for Instagram System Design
Scalability refers to the ability of an organization (or a system, such as a computer network) to perform well under an increased or expanding workload. A system that scales well will be able to maintain or increase its level of performance even as it is tested by larger and larger operational demands.

We can add more servers to application service layers to make the scalability better and handle numerous requests from the clients. We can also increase the number of databases to store the growing users’ data.
---
Availability: The system should be highly available.
Durability: Any uploaded content (photos and videos) should never get lost.
Consistency: We can compromise a little on consistency. It is acceptable if the content (photos or videos) takes time to show in followers’ feeds located in a distant region.
Reliability: The system must be able to tolerate hardware and software failures.
3. Capacity Estimation for Instagram System Design
We have 1 billion users, with 500 million as daily active users. Assume 60 million photos and 35 million videos are shared on Instagram per day. We can consider 3 MB as the maximum size of each photo and 150 MB as the maximum size of each video uploaded on Instagram.On average, each user sends 20 requests (of any type) per day to our service.

Scalability: We can add more servers to application service layers to make the scalability better and handle numerous requests from the clients. We can also increase the number of databases to store the growing users’ data.
Latency: The use of cache and CDNs have reduced the content fetching time.
Availability: We have made the system available to the users by using the storage and databases that are replicated across the globe.
Durability: We have persistent storage that maintains the backup of the data so any uploaded content (photos and videos) never gets lost.
Consistency: We have used storage like blob stores and databases to keep our data consistent globally.

In the above Diagram we have discussed about the use case diagram of Instagram:
---
If the user is new, they will register firstly it will be store in database, they will verifiy the profile.
If user is already signup, they will provide the email-Id and Password.
On the home page they will get the photos and videos, as well as the story page.
The post which is posted now, it will come at the top. User can follow or unfollow the person. User can get live. It’s all depend on them.
There will be setting, in which user can see there past story or the post which has been archive. User can unblock the person they can get verified account, after paying.
5. Low-Level Design(LLD) for Instagram System Design
design-instagram-lld

Here’s a breakdown of the key components and interactions for Instagram’s low-level design:
---
url = ""https://photoslibrary.googleapis.com/v1/mediaItems:search""
headers = {
    ""Authorization"": ""Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN""  # Replace with your access token
}
data = {
    ""filters"": {
        ""mediaTypes"": [""PHOTO"", ""VIDEO""]  # Search for both photos and videos
    }
}
response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=data)
 
if response.status_code == 200:
    results = response.json()
    # Process the search results
else:
    print(""Error:"", response.status_code, response.text)
8. Database Design for Instagram Database Design
We need the following tables to store our data:
---
{
userId: string[Hashkey]
uploadId: string
creationDateInUtc: long[RangeKey]
}
8.5 Which Database we should select for Data storing?
It is essential to choose the right kind of database for our Instagram system, but which is the right choice — SQL or NoSQL? Our data is inherently relational, and we need an order for the data (posts should appear in chronological order) and no data loss even in case of failures (data durability). Moreover, in our case, we would benefit from relational queries like fetching the followers or images based on a user ID. Hence, SQL-based databases fulfill these requirements.

It allows us to load the content when the user scrolls and therefore save the bandwidth and focus on loading the content the user is currently viewing. It improves the latency to view or search a particular photo or video on Instagram.
6. High-Level Design(HLD) for Instagram System Design
Our system should allow us to upload, view, and search images and videos at a high level. To upload images and videos, we need to store them, and upon fetching, we need to retrieve the data from the storage. Moreover, the users should also be allowed to follow each other.

2.1 Functional Requirements for Instagram System Design
In functional Requirements, we will not discuss the login or signup page of Instagram. Login and Signup architecture is the same for everyone. We will look for further like posting photos, etc.

10. Scalability for Instagram System Design
Scalability refers to the ability of an organization (or a system, such as a computer network) to perform well under an increased or expanding workload. A system that scales well will be able to maintain or increase its level of performance even as it is tested by larger and larger operational demands.

We can add more servers to application service layers to make the scalability better and handle numerous requests from the clients. We can also increase the number of databases to store the growing users’ data.

In the section on scalability, it is mentioned that adding more servers to the application service layers can improve scalability and handle numerous requests from clients. However, it does not provide specific guidance on how to right-size VMs for optimal performance.

To ensure that VMs are right-sized for their workloads, you can consider the following steps:

1. Identify the workload: Determine the type of workload that the application will be handling, such as database queries, web server requests, or data processing tasks.
2. Measure utilization: Monitor the utilization of the VMs running the application to identify areas where right-sizing can improve performance. This can include measuring CPU usage, memory usage, disk I/O, and other relevant metrics.
3. Adjust VM configurations: Based on the workload analysis, adjust the configuration of the VMs to better match the utilization requirements. This may involve increasing or decreasing the number of VM instances, adjusting the size and specs of the VMs, or optimizing the network configuration.
4. Monitor and adjust: Continuously monitor the performance of the application and adjust the VM configurations as needed to ensure optimal performance.

8. Database Design for Instagram Database Design
We need the following tables to store our data:
---
3.1 Storage Per Day
Photos: 60 million photos/day * 3 MB = 180 TeraBytes / day
Videos: 35 million videos/day * 150 MB = 5250 TB / day
Total content size = 180 + 5250 = 5430 TB
The Total Space required for a Year:
5430 TB/day * 365 (days a year) = 1981950 TB = 1981.95 PetaBytes

3.2 Bandwidth Estimation
5430 TB/(24 * 60* 60) = 5430 TB/86400 sec ~= 62.84 GB/s ~= 502.8 Gbps
Incoming bandwidth ~= 502.8 Gbps
Let’s say the ratio of readers to writers is 100:1.
Required outgoing bandwidth ~= 100 * 502.8 Gbps ~= 50.28 Tbps

API Endpoints:

GET /posts/{post_id}: Retrieves details of a post, including the number of likes/dislikes.
POST /posts/{post_id}/like: Registers a like for the post by the authenticated user.
POST /posts/{post_id}/dislike: Registers a dislike for the post by the authenticated user.
DELETE /posts/{post_id}/like: Removes the like for the post by the authenticated user (if previously done).
DELETE /posts/{post_id}/dislike: Removes the dislike for the post by the authenticated user (if previously done).

8.5 Which Database we should select for Data storing?
It is essential to choose the right kind of database for our Instagram system, but which is the right choice — SQL or NoSQL? Our data is inherently relational, and we need an order for the data (posts should appear in chronological order) and no data loss even in case of failures (data durability). Moreover, in our case, we would benefit from relational queries like fetching the followers or images based on a user ID. Hence, SQL-based databases fulfill these requirements.

It allows us to load the content when the user scrolls and therefore save the bandwidth and focus on loading the content the user is currently viewing. It improves the latency to view or search a particular photo or video on Instagram.
6. High-Level Design(HLD) for Instagram System Design
Our system should allow us to upload, view, and search images and videos at a high level. To upload images and videos, we need to store them, and upon fetching, we need to retrieve the data from the storage. Moreover, the users should also be allowed to follow each other.

10. Scalability for Instagram System Design
Scalability refers to the ability of an organization (or a system, such as a computer network) to perform well under an increased or expanding workload. A system that scales well will be able to maintain or increase its level of performance even as it is tested by larger and larger operational demands.

We can add more servers to application service layers to make the scalability better and handle numerous requests from the clients. We can also increase the number of databases to store the growing users’ data.

We need the following tables to store our data:
---
If the user is new, they will register firstly it will be store in database, they will verifiy the profile.
If user is already signup, they will provide the email-Id and Password.
On the home page they will get the photos and videos, as well as the story page.
The post which is posted now, it will come at the top. User can follow or unfollow the person. User can get live. It’s all depend on them.
There will be setting, in which user can see there past story or the post which has been archive. User can unblock the person they can get verified account, after paying.

8. Database Design for Instagram Database Design
We need the following tables to store our data:
---
3.1 Storage Per Day
Photos: 60 million photos/day * 3 MB = 180 TeraBytes / day
Videos: 35 million videos/day * 150 MB = 5250 TB / day
Total content size = 180 + 5250 = 5430 TB
The Total Space required for a Year:
5430 TB/day * 365 (days a year) = 1981950 TB = 1981.95 PetaBytes

3.2 Bandwidth Estimation
5430 TB/(24 * 60* 60) = 5430 TB/86400 sec ~= 62.84 GB/s ~= 502.8 Gbps
Incoming bandwidth ~= 502.8 Gbps
Let’s say the ratio of readers to writers is 100:1.
Required outgoing bandwidth ~= 100 * 502.8 Gbps ~= 50.28 Tbps

Here’s a breakdown of the key components and interactions for Instagram’s low-level design:
---
{
userId: string[Hashkey]
uploadId: string
creationDateInUtc: long[RangeKey]
}
8.5 Which Database we should select for Data storing?
It is essential to choose the right kind of database for our Instagram system, but which is the right choice — SQL or NoSQL? Our data is inherently relational, and we need an order for the data (posts should appear in chronological order) and no data loss even in case of failures (data durability). Moreover, in our case, we would benefit from relational queries like fetching the followers or images based on a user ID. Hence, SQL-based databases fulfill these requirements.

It allows us to load the content when the user scrolls and therefore save the bandwidth and focus on loading the content the user is currently viewing. It improves the latency to view or search a particular photo or video on Instagram.
6. High-Level Design(HLD) for Instagram System Design
Our system should allow us to upload, view, and search images and videos at a high level. To upload images and videos, we need to store them, and upon fetching, we need to retrieve the data from the storage. Moreover, the users should also be allowed to follow each other.

2. Requirements for Instagram System Design
2.1 Functional Requirements for Instagram System Design
In functional Requirements, we will not discuss the login or signup page of Instagram. Login and Signup architecture is the same for everyone. We will look for further like posting photos, etc.

10. Scalability for Instagram System Design
Scalability refers to the ability of an organization (or a system, such as a computer network) to perform well under an increased or expanding workload. A system that scales well will be able to maintain or increase its level of performance even as it is tested by larger and larger operational demands.

We can add more servers to application service layers to make the scalability better and handle numerous requests from the clients. We can also increase the number of databases to store the growing users’ data.
---
Microservices – also known as the microservice architecture – is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of services that are:

Independently deployable
Loosely coupled
Organized around business capabilities
Owned by a small team
The microservice architecture enables an organization to deliver large, complex applications rapidly, frequently, reliably and sustainably – a necessity for competing and winning in today’s world.

Reliability: The system must be able to tolerate hardware and software failures.
3. Capacity Estimation for Instagram System Design
We have 1 billion users, with 500 million as daily active users. Assume 60 million photos and 35 million videos are shared on Instagram per day. We can consider 3 MB as the maximum size of each photo and 150 MB as the maximum size of each video uploaded on Instagram.On average, each user sends 20 requests (of any type) per day to our service.

It is essential to choose the right kind of database for our Instagram system, but which is the right choice — SQL or NoSQL? Our data is inherently relational, and we need an order for the data (posts should appear in chronological order) and no data loss even in case of failures (data durability). Moreover, in our case, we would benefit from relational queries like fetching the followers or images based on a user ID. Hence, SQL-based databases fulfill these requirements.

Instagram is an American photo and video-sharing social networking service owned by Meta Platforms. It allows users to upload media that can be edited with filters, be organized by hashtags, and be associated with a location via geographical tagging. Posts can be shared publicly or with preapproved followers.

Components:
Client: Mobile apps, web app, and APIs providing interface for users to interact with the system.
Authentication & Authorization: Handles user login, registration, and access control.
Content Management: Manages user-generated content like photos, videos, live streams, stories, and messages.
Feed Generation: Personalizes news feeds for each user based on their follows, activity, and engagement.
Social Graph: Tracks relationships between users (follows, followers, friends).
Discovery & Search: Enables searching for users, hashtags, locations, and content.
Notifications: Informs users about relevant events like likes, comments, mentions, and follows.
Analytics & Reporting: Tracks user engagement, content performance, and overall platform usage.
Interactions:
---
POST /media: Submits a new photo or video.
PUT /media/{media_id}: Updates existing metadata for a media item.
DELETE /media/{media_id}: Deletes a media item.

This suggests that Instagram may be considering using a microservice architecture for its system, but only if needed to avoid unnecessary overhead. The design document does not provide any specific details on the use of a service mesh, but it is possible that one could be used as part of the microservice architecture to provide additional functionality and flexibility.

In general, a service mesh is a tool that enables communication between microservices in a distributed system. It provides features such as traffic management, load balancing, circuit breaking, and monitoring, which can help ensure reliable and efficient communication between services. By using a service mesh, Instagram may be able to simplify its architecture, improve performance, and reduce complexity.

8. Database Design for Instagram Database Design
We need the following tables to store our data:
---
Feed Generation adjusts based on changed relationships.
User monitors activity:
Client checks notifications feed.
Notifications provide updates on relevant events.
Key Design Considerations:
---
If the user is new, they will register firstly it will be store in database, they will verifiy the profile.
If user is already signup, they will provide the email-Id and Password.
On the home page they will get the photos and videos, as well as the story page.
The post which is posted now, it will come at the top. User can follow or unfollow the person. User can get live. It’s all depend on them.
There will be setting, in which user can see there past story or the post which has been archive. User can unblock the person they can get verified account, after paying.
5. Low-Level Design(LLD) for Instagram System Design
design-instagram-lld

Here’s a breakdown of the key components and interactions for Instagram’s low-level design:
---
API Endpoints:

GET /posts/{post_id}: Retrieves details of a post, including the number of likes/dislikes.
POST /posts/{post_id}/like: Registers a like for the post by the authenticated user.
POST /posts/{post_id}/dislike: Registers a dislike for the post by the authenticated user.
DELETE /posts/{post_id}/like: Removes the like for the post by the authenticated user (if previously done).
DELETE /posts/{post_id}/dislike: Removes the dislike for the post by the authenticated user (if previously done).
---
{
userId: string[Hashkey]
uploadId: string
creationDateInUtc: long[RangeKey]
}
8.5 Which Database we should select for Data storing?
It is essential to choose the right kind of database for our Instagram system, but which is the right choice — SQL or NoSQL? Our data is inherently relational, and we need an order for the data (posts should appear in chronological order) and no data loss even in case of failures (data durability). Moreover, in our case, we would benefit from relational queries like fetching the followers or images based on a user ID. Hence, SQL-based databases fulfill these requirements.

It allows us to load the content when the user scrolls and therefore save the bandwidth and focus on loading the content the user is currently viewing. It improves the latency to view or search a particular photo or video on Instagram.
6. High-Level Design(HLD) for Instagram System Design
Our system should allow us to upload, view, and search images and videos at a high level. To upload images and videos, we need to store them, and upon fetching, we need to retrieve the data from the storage. Moreover, the users should also be allowed to follow each other.

2. Requirements for Instagram System Design
2.1 Functional Requirements for Instagram System Design
In functional Requirements, we will not discuss the login or signup page of Instagram. Login and Signup architecture is the same for everyone. We will look for further like posting photos, etc.
---
10. Scalability for Instagram System Design
Scalability refers to the ability of an organization (or a system, such as a computer network) to perform well under an increased or expanding workload. A system that scales well will be able to maintain or increase its level of performance even as it is tested by larger and larger operational demands.

We can add more servers to application service layers to make the scalability better and handle numerous requests from the clients. We can also increase the number of databases to store the growing users’ data.
---
Notification Service:
Informs users about relevant events like likes, comments, mentions, and follows.
Pushes notifications to mobile devices through platforms like Firebase Cloud Messaging or Amazon SNS.
Leverages a queueing system for asynchronous notification delivery.
Analytics Service:
Tracks user engagement, post performance, and overall platform usage.
Gathers data on views, likes, comments, shares, and clicks.
Provides insights to improve user experience, optimize content recommendations, and target advertising.
Why we need caching for storing the data?
Cache the data to handle millions of reads. It improves the user experience by making the fetching process fast. We’ll also opt for lazy loading, which minimizes the client’s waiting time.
---
Endpoints:

POST /users/{user_id}/follow: Follows the specified user.
DELETE /users/{user_id}/follow: Unfollows the specified user.
GET /users/{user_id}/following: Retrieves a list of users followed by the specified user (paginated).
GET /users/{user_id}/followers: Retrieves a list of users following the specified user (paginated).
{
  ""message"": ""User followed successfully""
}
7.3 Like or Dislike posts
Designing an API for liking and disliking posts involves multiple considerations. Here’s a breakdown of key aspects to think about:

API Endpoints:
---
Microservices – also known as the microservice architecture – is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of services that are:

Independently deployable
Loosely coupled
Organized around business capabilities
Owned by a small team
The microservice architecture enables an organization to deliver large, complex applications rapidly, frequently, reliably and sustainably – a necessity for competing and winning in today’s world.
---
3.1 Storage Per Day
Photos: 60 million photos/day * 3 MB = 180 TeraBytes / day
Videos: 35 million videos/day * 150 MB = 5250 TB / day
Total content size = 180 + 5250 = 5430 TB
The Total Space required for a Year:
5430 TB/day * 365 (days a year) = 1981950 TB = 1981.95 PetaBytes

3.2 Bandwidth Estimation
5430 TB/(24 * 60* 60) = 5430 TB/86400 sec ~= 62.84 GB/s ~= 502.8 Gbps
Incoming bandwidth ~= 502.8 Gbps
Let’s say the ratio of readers to writers is 100:1.
Required outgoing bandwidth ~= 100 * 502.8 Gbps ~= 50.28 Tbps

Additionally, the use of CDNs can help reduce latency by serving static content from locations closer to the users.

In terms of prioritizing critical traffic and shedding lower priority traffic to improve performance, the following strategies can be employed:

1. Traffic Prioritization: Critical traffic can be prioritized using techniques such as Quality of Service (QoS) or Class-Based QoS, which assigns different levels of service to different types of traffic based on their priority level.
2. Content Delivery Networks (CDNs): CDNs can be used to serve static content from locations closer to the users, reducing latency and improving performance.
3. Load Balancing: Load balancing can be used to distribute incoming traffic across multiple servers, improving response time and reducing the risk of overloading any single server.
4. Caching: As mentioned earlier, caching can be used to store frequently accessed data in a faster and more efficient manner, reducing the load on the backend servers and improving performance.
5. Queries Optimization: Database queries can be optimized using techniques such as indexing, caching, and query optimization to reduce latency and improve performance.
6. Server Grouping: Critical traffic can be served from a group of dedicated servers, reducing latency and improving performance.
7. Content Compression: Compressing content can reduce the amount of data being transmitted, which can improve performance by reducing the load on the network and reducing latency.
8. Connection Pooling: Connection pooling can be used to maintain a pool of available connections, reducing the overhead of establishing new connections and improving performance.
9. Session persistence: Session persistence can be used to maintain the user's session state across server restarts, improving performance by reducing the overhead of re-establishing sessions.
10. Load Balancing based on HTTP header: Load balancing can be done based on HTTP headers like User-Agent, Referer, or Cookies to direct traffic to the appropriate backend server, improving performance and scalability.

We need the following tables to store our data:
---
Interactions:
User creates content:
Client uploads photo/video.
Content Management stores media and metadata.
Feed Generation updates user’s and relevant followers’ feeds.
Notifications inform interested users.
User interacts with content:
Client sends like/comment/share actions.
Content Management and Social Graph update relevant data.
Feed Generation potentially reshuffles feeds based on new interactions.
Notifications inform interested users.
User discovers new content:
Client uses search functionalities.

}
8.5 Which Database we should select for Data storing?
It is essential to choose the right kind of database for our Instagram system, but which is the right choice — SQL or NoSQL? Our data is inherently relational, and we need an order for the data (posts should appear in chronological order) and no data loss even in case of failures (data durability). Moreover, in our case, we would benefit from relational queries like fetching the followers or images based on a user ID. Hence, SQL-based databases fulfill these requirements.

10. Scalability for Instagram System Design
Scalability refers to the ability of an organization (or a system, such as a computer network) to perform well under an increased or expanding workload. A system that scales well will be able to maintain or increase its level of performance even as it is tested by larger and larger operational demands.

We can add more servers to application service layers to make the scalability better and handle numerous requests from the clients. We can also increase the number of databases to store the growing users’ data.
---
Notification Service:
Informs users about relevant events like likes, comments, mentions, and follows.
Pushes notifications to mobile devices through platforms like Firebase Cloud Messaging or Amazon SNS.
Leverages a queueing system for asynchronous notification delivery.
Analytics Service:
Tracks user engagement, post performance, and overall platform usage.
Gathers data on views, likes, comments, shares, and clicks.
Provides insights to improve user experience, optimize content recommendations, and target advertising.
Why we need caching for storing the data?
Cache the data to handle millions of reads. It improves the user experience by making the fetching process fast. We’ll also opt for lazy loading, which minimizes the client’s waiting time.

We’ll also opt for lazy loading, which minimizes the client’s waiting time.",2.289020538330078,"Based on the given design document, there is no direct mention of using AI/ML models that consume less energy while maintaining performance. However, there are some suggestions for improving scalability and latency, which could potentially benefit from the use of AI/ML models:

1. Scalability: The design suggests adding more servers to handle increased workload and increasing the number of databases to store growing user data. This approach can help improve scalability by distributing the workload across multiple servers and providing additional storage for growing user data. However, using AI/ML models that consume less energy could potentially further improve scalability by reducing the energy consumption of the servers and databases, which can lead to cost savings and improved environmental sustainability.
2. Latency: The design suggests using cache and CDNs to reduce content fetching time. This approach can help improve latency by reducing the distance between the client and the server, as well as the amount of data that needs to be transferred. Using AI/ML models that consume less energy could potentially further improve latency by reducing the energy consumption of the cache and CDNs, which can lead to faster content delivery and improved user experience.
3. Availability: The design suggests using storage and databases that are replicated across the globe to ensure availability. This approach can help improve availability by providing redundant storage and database instances that can handle increased traffic and load. Using AI/ML models that consume less energy could potentially further improve availability by reducing the energy consumption of the storage and database instances, which can lead to improved uptime and reduced maintenance costs.
4. Durability: The design suggests using persistent storage to maintain backups of uploaded content. This approach can help improve durability by ensuring that uploaded content is never lost due to hardware failures or other issues. Using AI/ML models that consume less energy could potentially further improve durability by reducing the energy consumption of the persistent storage, which can lead to improved data integrity and reduced maintenance costs.
5. Consistency: The design suggests using storage and databases that are replicated across the globe to ensure consistency. This approach can help improve consistency by providing redundant storage and database instances that can handle increased traffic and load. Using AI/ML models that consume less energy could potentially further improve consistency by reducing the energy consumption of the storage and database instances, which can lead to improved data integrity and reduced maintenance costs.

In summary, while there is no direct mention of using AI/ML models in the design document, there are opportunities to leverage these models to improve scalability, latency, availability, durability, and consistency.

Photos: 60 million photos/day * 3 MB = 180 TeraBytes / day
Videos: 35 million videos/day * 150 MB = 5250 TB / day
Total content size = 180 + 5250 = 5430 TB

---
If the user is new, they will register firstly it will be store in database, they will verifiy the profile.
If user is already signup, they will provide the email-Id and Password.
On the home page they will get the photos and videos, as well as the story page.
The post which is posted now, it will come at the top. User can follow or unfollow the person. User can get live. It’s all depend on them.

---
{
userId: string[Hashkey]
uploadId: string
creationDateInUtc: long[RangeKey]
}
8.5 Which Database we should select for Data storing?
It is essential to choose the right kind of database for our Instagram system, but which is the right choice — SQL or NoSQL? Our data is inherently relational, and we need an order for the data (posts should appear in chronological order) and no data loss even in case of failures (data durability). Moreover, in our case, we would benefit from relational queries like fetching the followers or images based on a user ID. Hence, SQL-based databases fulfill these requirements.

Scalability refers to the ability of an organization (or a system, such as a computer network) to perform well under an increased or expanding workload. A system that scales well will be able to maintain or increase its level of performance even as it is tested by larger and larger operational demands.

We can add more servers to application service layers to make the scalability better and handle numerous requests from the clients. We can also increase the number of databases to store the growing users’ data.

We need the following tables to store our data:
---
3.1 Storage Per Day
Photos: 60 million photos/day * 3 MB = 180 TeraBytes / day
Videos: 35 million videos/day * 150 MB = 5250 TB / day
Total content size = 180 + 5250 = 5430 TB
The Total Space required for a Year:
5430 TB/day * 365 (days a year) = 1981950 TB = 1981.95 PetaBytes

3.2 Bandwidth Estimation
5430 TB/(24 * 60* 60) = 5430 TB/86400 sec ~= 62.84 GB/s ~= 502.8 Gbps
Incoming bandwidth ~= 502.8 Gbps
Let’s say the ratio of readers to writers is 100:1.

}
8.5 Which Database we should select for Data storing?
It is essential to choose the right kind of database for our Instagram system, but which is the right choice — SQL or NoSQL? Our data is inherently relational, and we need an order for the data (posts should appear in chronological order) and no data loss even in case of failures (data durability). Moreover, in our case, we would benefit from relational queries like fetching the followers or images based on a user ID. Hence, SQL-based databases fulfill these requirements.

It allows us to load the content when the user scrolls and therefore save the bandwidth and focus on loading the content the user is currently viewing. It improves the latency to view or search a particular photo or video on Instagram.
6. High-Level Design(HLD) for Instagram System Design
Our system should allow us to upload, view, and search images and videos at a high level. To upload images and videos, we need to store them, and upon fetching, we need to retrieve the data from the storage. Moreover, the users should also be allowed to follow each other.

2. Requirements for Instagram System Design
2.1 Functional Requirements for Instagram System Design
In functional Requirements, we will not discuss the login or signup page of Instagram. Login and Signup architecture is the same for everyone. We will look for further like posting photos, etc.

10. Scalability for Instagram System Design
Scalability refers to the ability of an organization (or a system, such as a computer network) to perform well under an increased or expanding workload. A system that scales well will be able to maintain or increase its level of performance even as it is tested by larger and larger operational demands.

We can add more servers to application service layers to make the scalability better and handle numerous requests from the clients. We can also increase the number of databases to store the growing users’ data.
---
Microservices – also known as the microservice architecture – is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of services that are:

Independently deployable
Loosely coupled
Organized around business capabilities
Owned by a small team
The microservice architecture enables an organization to deliver large, complex applications rapidly, frequently, reliably and sustainably – a necessity for competing and winning in today’s world.

7.3 Like or Dislike posts
Designing an API for liking and disliking posts involves multiple considerations. Here’s a breakdown of key aspects to think about:

API Endpoints:",2.330030679702759,"The design document you've provided covers the architecture and requirements for an Instagram-like platform. Here are some key takeaways and suggestions based on your document:

1. Database selection: Since your data is inherently relational, you may want to consider using a SQL-based database like MySQL or PostgreSQL. These databases are designed to handle complex queries and relationships, which aligns with your data model. NoSQL databases like MongoDB may also be suitable depending on the specific requirements of your system.
2. Microservices architecture: You've mentioned that you want to use a microservices architecture for your platform. This is a good approach as it allows you to break down the system into smaller, independent components that can be developed and deployed separately. However, make sure to consider the communication overhead between microservices when designing your architecture.
3. Scalability: You've discussed scalability concerns, which are understandable given the high traffic that Instagram experiences. To address this, you may want to consider using load balancers, auto-scaling, and other techniques to distribute traffic across multiple servers. Additionally, consider using a distributed database like Apache Cassandra or Riak to handle large amounts of data across many nodes.
4. Caching and CDNs: You've mentioned the use of caching and Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) to reduce content fetching time. This is a good approach as it can significantly improve the user experience by reducing the number of requests made to your servers. Make sure to consider the cache invalidation mechanism to avoid cached data becoming stale.
5. Availability: You've discussed the importance of availability, which is crucial for any social media platform. To ensure high availability, you may want to consider using a distributed architecture that can handle failures across multiple servers or instances. Additionally, use load balancers and auto-scaling techniques to distribute traffic across multiple nodes.
6. Latency: You've mentioned the importance of reducing latency, which is critical for a social media platform. To address this, consider using caching, CDNs, and other techniques to reduce the time it takes for content to be delivered to users. Additionally, optimize your database queries to minimize the time spent on data retrieval.
7. Security: You've discussed the importance of security, which is a critical aspect of any social media platform. Make sure to implement proper authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users can access sensitive data. Additionally, consider using encryption to protect user data both in transit and at rest.
8. Energy efficiency: While there's no mention of selecting an energy-efficient AI/ML framework, you may want to consider using such a framework in the future as it can help reduce the carbon footprint of your platform. Some examples of energy-efficient frameworks include TensorFlow Lite, PyTorch Lite, and Caffe2.

In summary, your design document covers most of the key aspects of an Instagram-like platform. However, you may want to consider additional factors such as energy efficiency, scalability, and security when designing your architecture.",18.52066922187805,0,"[(Document(page_content='Microservices – also known as the microservice architecture – is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of services that are:\n\nIndependently deployable\nLoosely coupled\nOrganized around business capabilities\nOwned by a small team\nThe microservice architecture enables an organization to deliver large, complex applications rapidly, frequently, reliably and sustainably – a necessity for competing and winning in today’s world.', metadata={'id': 'documentsFromText/Instagram/content.txt:None:24', 'source': 'documentsFromText/Instagram/content.txt'}), 12333.351582064459), (Document(page_content='API Endpoints:\n\nGET /posts/{post_id}: Retrieves details of a post, including the number of likes/dislikes.\nPOST /posts/{post_id}/like: Registers a like for the post by the authenticated user.\nPOST /posts/{post_id}/dislike: Registers a dislike for the post by the authenticated user.\nDELETE /posts/{post_id}/like: Removes the like for the post by the authenticated user (if previously done).\nDELETE /posts/{post_id}/dislike: Removes the dislike for the post by the authenticated user (if previously done).', metadata={'id': 'documentsFromText/Instagram/content.txt:None:19', 'source': 'documentsFromText/Instagram/content.txt'}), 13391.832521391163), (Document(page_content='Notification Service:\nInforms users about relevant events like likes, comments, mentions, and follows.\nPushes notifications to mobile devices through platforms like Firebase Cloud Messaging or Amazon SNS.\nLeverages a queueing system for asynchronous notification delivery.\nAnalytics Service:\nTracks user engagement, post performance, and overall platform usage.\nGathers data on views, likes, comments, shares, and clicks.\nProvides insights to improve user experience, optimize content recommendations, and target advertising.\nWhy we need caching for storing the data?\nCache the data to handle millions of reads.

8.5 Which Database we should select for Data storing?
It is essential to choose the right kind of database for our Instagram system, but which is the right choice — SQL or NoSQL? Our data is inherently relational, and we need an order for the data (posts should appear in chronological order) and no data loss even in case of failures (data durability). Moreover, in our case, we would benefit from relational queries like fetching the followers or images based on a user ID. Hence, SQL-based databases fulfill these requirements.

It allows us to load the content when the user scrolls and therefore save the bandwidth and focus on loading the content the user is currently viewing. It improves the latency to view or search a particular photo or video on Instagram.
6. High-Level Design(HLD) for Instagram System Design
Our system should allow us to upload, view, and search images and videos at a high level. To upload images and videos, we need to store them, and upon fetching, we need to retrieve the data from the storage. Moreover, the users should also be allowed to follow each other.

2.1 Functional Requirements for Instagram System Design
In functional Requirements, we will not discuss the login or signup page of Instagram. Login and Signup architecture is the same for everyone. We will look for further like posting photos, etc.

10. Scalability for Instagram System Design
Scalability refers to the ability of an organization (or a system, such as a computer network) to perform well under an increased or expanding workload. A system that scales well will be able to maintain or increase its level of performance even as it is tested by larger and larger operational demands.

We can add more servers to application service layers to make the scalability better and handle numerous requests from the clients. We can also increase the number of databases to store the growing users’ data.
---
Microservices – also known as the microservice architecture – is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of services that are:

Independently deployable
Loosely coupled
Organized around business capabilities
Owned by a small team
The microservice architecture enables an organization to deliver large, complex applications rapidly, frequently, reliably and sustainably – a necessity for competing and winning in today’s world.

7.3 Like or Dislike posts
Designing an API for liking and disliking posts involves multiple considerations. Here’s a breakdown of key aspects to think about:

API Endpoints:
---
These requirements has been covered:
Scalability: We can add more servers to application service layers to make the scalability better and handle numerous requests from the clients. We can also increase the number of databases to store the growing users’ data.
Latency: The use of cache and CDNs have reduced the content fetching time.
Availability: We have made the system available to the users by using the storage and databases that are replicated across the globe.
Durability: We have persistent storage that maintains the backup of the data so any uploaded content (photos and videos) never gets lost.
Consistency: We have used storage like blob stores and databases to keep our data consistent globally.
---
Notification Service:
Informs users about relevant events like likes, comments, mentions, and follows.
Pushes notifications to mobile devices through platforms like Firebase Cloud Messaging or Amazon SNS.
Leverages a queueing system for asynchronous notification delivery.
Analytics Service:
Tracks user engagement, post performance, and overall platform usage.
Gathers data on views, likes, comments, shares, and clicks.
Provides insights to improve user experience, optimize content recommendations, and target advertising.
Why we need caching for storing the data?
Cache the data to handle millions of reads. It improves the user experience by making the fetching process fast. We’ll also opt for lazy loading, which minimizes the client’s waiting time.",2.339566707611084,"The answer to this question is no, there is no mention of selecting the right hardware or VM instance types for energy-efficient AI/ML training in the provided text.

8. Database Design for Instagram Database Design
We need the following tables to store our data:

---

3.1 Storage Per Day
Photos: 60 million photos/day * 3 MB = 180 TeraBytes / day
Videos: 35 million videos/day * 150 MB = 5250 TB / day
Total content size = 180 + 5250 = 5430 TB
The Total Space required for a Year:
5430 TB/day * 365 (days a year) = 1981950 TB = 1981.95 PetaBytes

3.2 Bandwidth Estimation
5430 TB/(24 * 60* 60) = 5430 TB/86400 sec ~= 62.84 GB/s ~= 502.8 Gbps
Incoming bandwidth ~= 502.8 Gbps
Let’s say the ratio of readers to writers is 100:1.
Required outgoing bandwidth ~= 100 * 502.8 Gbps ~= 50.28 Tbps

In the above Diagram we have discussed about the use case diagram of Instagram:

---

If the user is new, they will register firstly it will be store in database, they will verifiy the profile.
If user is already signup, they will provide the email-Id and Password.
On the home page they will get the photos and videos, as well as the story page.
The post which is posted now, it will come at the top. User can follow or unfollow the person. User can get live. It’s all depend on them.
There will be setting, in which user can see there past story or the post which has been archive. User can unblock the person they can get verified account, after paying.
