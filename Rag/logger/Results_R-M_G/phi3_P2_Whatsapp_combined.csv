Is there any mention of minimizing the total number of deployed environments?,"Consistency: Messages should be delivered in the order they were sent.
Availability: The system should be highly available. However, the availability can be compromised in the interest of consistency.
Security: The system must be secure via end-to-end encryption. The end-to-end encryption ensures that only the two communicating parties can see the content of messages. Nobody in between, not even WhatsApp, should have access.
Scalability: The system should be highly scalable to support an ever-increasing number of users and messages per day.
Capacity Estimation
Storage Estimation:
100 billion messages are shared through WhatsApp per day and each message takes 100 bytes on average
100 billion/day∗100 Bytes = 10 TB/day
For 30 days, the storage capacity would become the following:

---

Bandwidth Estimation:
According to the storage capacity estimation, our service will get 10TB of data each day, giving us a bandwidth of 926 Mb/s.
10 TB/86400sec ≈ 926Mb/s

Number of servers estimation:
WhatsApp handles around 10 million connections on a single server, which seems quite high for a server.
No. of servers = Total connections per day/No. of connections per server = 2 billion/10 million = 200 servers
So, according to the above estimates, we require 200 chat servers.

Approach to achieve the below system attributes
Requirements
The WhatsApp messenger design should meet below requirements:

---

Functional Requirement
Conversation: The system should support one-on-one and group conversations between users.
Acknowledgment: The system should support message delivery acknowledgment, such as sent, delivered, and read.
Sharing: The system should support sharing of media files, such as images, videos, and audio.
Chat storage: The system must support the persistent storage of chat messages when a user is offline until the successful delivery of messages.
Push notifications: The system should be able to notify offline users of new messages once their status becomes online.
Non-Functional Requirement
Low latency: Users should be able to receive messages with low latency.
Consistency: Messages should be delivered in the order they were sent.

---

Now, here comes the responsibility of the group service. The group service keeps all information about users in each group in the system. It has all the information about each group, including user IDs, group ID, status, group icon, number of users, and so on. This service resides on top of the MySQL database cluster, with multiple secondary replicas distributed geographically. A Redis cache server also exists to cache data from the MySQL servers. Both geographically distributed replicas and Redis cache aid in reducing latency.

The group message handler communicates with the group service to retrieve data of Group/A users. In the last step, the group message handler follows the same process as a WebSocket server and delivers the message to each user.

---

4. Support for Group messages
Since user A is connected to a WebSocket server, it sends a message to the message service intended for Group A.The message service sends the message to Kafka with other specific information about the group. The message is saved there for further processing. In Kafka terminology, a group can be a topic, and the senders and receivers can be producers and consumers, respectively.

API Design
Send message
sendMessage(message_ID, sender_ID, reciever_ID, type, text=none, media_object=none, document=none)

The following steps describe the communication between both clients:

User A and user B create a communication channel with the chat server.
User A sends a message to the chat server.
Upon receiving the message, the chat server acknowledges back to user A.
The chat server sends the message to user B and stores the message in the database if the receiver’s status is offline.
User B sends an acknowledgment to the chat server.
The chat server notifies user A that the message has been successfully delivered.
When user B reads the message, the application notifies the chat server.
The chat server notifies user A that user B has read the message.
Data Model Design:

The responsibility of each of these servers is to provide a port to every online user. The mapping between servers, ports, and users is stored in the WebSocket manager that resides on top of a cluster of the data store. In this case, that’s Redis.

2. Send or receive messages
The WebSocket manager is responsible for maintaining a mapping between an active user and a port assigned to the user. Whenever a user is connected to another WebSocket server, this information will be updated in the data store. A WebSocket server also communicates with another service called message service.

Low-Level-Design(LLD)-of-WhatsApp-Messenger

1. Connection with Websocket Server
In WhatsApp, each active device is connected with a WebSocket server via WebSocket protocol. A WebSocket server keeps the connection open with all the active (online) users. Since one server isn’t enough to handle billions of devices, there should be enough servers to handle billions of users.

For 30 days, the storage capacity would become the following:
30∗10 TB/day = 300 TB/month",88.65647196769714," The provided text does not explicitly discuss strategies for minimizing the total number of deployed environments. However, it's implied through some design choices and service responsibilities that are aimed at efficiency which could help in reducing deployment complexity:

1. Microservices Architecture - This architecture allows different components to be developed, scaled, and updated independently, potentially decreasing the need for numerous deployments across a large system like WhatsApp with billions of users worldwide. However, it doesn't directly minimize environments but ensures that each service can run on its own server(s), which could inadvertently reduce overall deployment complexity due to separation of concerns and modular design principles.

2. Message Service Communication - By using a message queuing system like Kafka for group messaging, the application offloads certain tasks from real-time processing (which would require more environments) to asynchronous communication that can be scaled separately without impacting direct user interaction layers significantly. This approach may reduce some of the complexity in deployment as it separates concerns between immediate delivery and queue management.

3. WebSocket Manager - A dedicated service for managing port mappings could streamline connections, potentially reducing redundancies across multiple deployments by efficiently allocating ports to active users rather than having a complex system within each user's environment trying to manage this itself. However, it doesn’t directly reduce the number of environments deployed but can help in optimizing resource usage per deployment.

4. Data Storage and Caching - The use of MySQL cluster with secondary replicas distributed geographically combined with a Redis cache server suggests an architecture that prioritizes low latency and rapid access to frequently accessed data, which might reduce the need for deploying additional environments solely as caching or redundancy layers within user-facing services.

To explicitly minimize total number of deployed environments while maintaining high availability and performance across billions of devices with 30 days storage capacity needs (which is around 300 TB/month), one must consider:

- Scalable Infrastructure - Using cloud infrastructure services that automatically scale can reduce the need for manual scaling, thus limiting deployments. Cloud providers usually allow creating a pool of instances or containers to manage with proper auto-scaling configurations and load balancers which adjust resources based on actual traffic patterns without frequent human intervention.
  
- Containerization - Deploy services using container orchestration systems like Kubernetes, where you can define the desired number of replicas for each service instead of deployments across various environments manually. This approach allows efficient resource utilization and scaling within a smaller set of physical or virtual machines with automatic self-healing capabilities in case of failures (e.g., containers automatically restart).
  
- Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) Pipelines - Implementing CI/CD pipelines to automate the build, test and deployment processes can significantly reduce human errors and streamline releases across environments leading towards a leaner approach of deployments. The pipeline ensures that only passing code gets deployed which minimizes chances of introducing breaking changes into production without needing multiple deployments per change cycle (for rollbacks or feature flagging).

In summary, while the original text does not provide explicit measures to reduce deployment environments and seems more focused on achieving performance and efficiency through architecture design choices, these principles can be extrapolated towards minimizing total environment footprint when combined with modern cloud practices such as containerization and automation.",70.36132740974426,0,"[Document(page_content='Consistency: Messages should be delivered in the order they were sent.\nAvailability: The system should be highly available.

1. Connection with Websocket Server
In WhatsApp, each active device is connected with a WebSocket server via WebSocket protocol. A WebSocket server keeps the connection open with all the active (online) users. Since one server isn’t enough to handle billions of devices, there should be enough servers to handle billions of users.",109.39066338539124," The provided WhatsApp messenger system design focuses on delivering a robust and responsive user experience with features like one-on end and group conversations, message acknowledgment, media sharing, persistent chat messages during offline periods, and push notifications.

Storage Optimization: While not explicitly mentioned in this design overview regarding optimizing storage utilization, several strategies could be implemented within such systems without compromising on functionality or performance to handle the projected data growth effectively as described (30 TB/day). Here are some possible methods that can help optimize the use of available space:

1. Data Deduplication and Compression - Implementing algorithms for reducing redundancy in shared media files before storage, such as storing only one copy while referencing it across multiple conversations or using compression techniques to reduce file size without significant quality loss. This method also saves bandwidth when syncing data between servers.

2. Efficient Data Archiving: For messages that are older than a certain threshold (e.g., 30 days), implement an archival strategy where the system would store these in less expensive, lower-performant storage tiers or even external services while keeping recent and frequently accessed data on primary storages for faster retrieval.

3. Database Optimization: Leveraging MySQL's capabilities such as indexing to expedite query performance could help keep latency low when accessing chat messages from the database during message delivery processes, acknowledgments etc. Also using partitioned tables based on user or group ID can speed up data retrieval and maintenance operations within Redis caching layer for frequently accessed items in real-time conversations.

4. Periodic Cleanup: Implement scheduled tasks to purge expired messages (e.g., older than 30 days) from active chat histories, which might then be moved to the archival storage or deleted depending on retention policies and legal requirements for data privacy concerns like GDPR compliance.

5. Storage Tiering: Use multiple storage tiers within your database cluster where frequently accessed (hot) files are kept in faster-performing SSDs, while less critical ones can be moved to slower HDDs or even cloud object stores when not actively used for cheaper costs and space savings.

6. Incremental Data Processing: Instead of storing all user media data directly on the database servers at scale (e.g., 30 TB/day), consider using services like AWS Glacier, Google Cloud Storage's archive bucket or Azure Blob Archive that are designed for long-term storage and only move relevant file copies to primary storages when a specific trigger is met in case of urgent retrieval requirement while saving costs on unnecessary data duplication.

7. Data Deduplication at the Message Store Level: At Kafka, where messages are stored before being sent out as group messaging (a common pattern), deduplicate message deliveries to ensure that multiple copies aren't created for each user in a chat when replicated across different brokers/nodes within your cluster.

These methods would need further consideration during the detailed system design phase, including performance trade-offs and costs analysis since optimizing storage is not just about saving space but also maintaining fast access times essential to ensure low latency message delivery as required by WhatsApp'ner functionality specifications mentioned above in your project.",71.27265977859497,0,"[Document(page_content='Consistency: Messages should be delivered in the order they were sent.\nAvailability: The system should be highly available.

It is built upon microservices architecture to enable scalability across multiple servers handling the load of billions of users globally while maintaining a low latency for real-time messaging interactions.

Storage Optimization: While not explicitly mentioned in this design overview regarding optimizing storage utilization, several strategies could be implemented within such systems without compromising on functionality or performance to handle the projected data growth effectively as described (30 TB/day). Here are some possible methods that can help optimize the use of available space:

1. Data Deduplication and Compression - Implementing algorithms for reducing redundancy in shared media files before storage, such as storing only one copy while referencing it across multiple conversations or using compression techniques to reduce file size without significant quality loss. This method also saves bandwidth when syncing data between servers.

2. Efficient Data Archiving: For messages that are older than a certain threshold (e.g., 30 days), implement an archival strategy where the system would store these in less expensive, lower-performant storage tiers or even external services while keeping recent and frequently accessed data on primary storages for faster retrieval.

3. Database Optimization: Leveraging MySQL's capabilities such as indexing to expedite query performance could help keep latency low when accessing chat messages from the database during message delivery processes, acknowledgments etc. Also using partitioned tables based on user or group ID can speed up data retrieval and maintenance operations within Redis caching layer for frequently accessed items in real-time conversations.

4. Periodic Cleanup: Implement scheduled tasks to purge expired messages (e.g., older than 30 days) from active chat histories, which might then be moved to the archival storage or deleted depending on retention policies and legal requirements for data privacy concerns like GDPR compliance.

5. Storage Tiering: Use multiple storage tiers within your database cluster where frequently accessed (hot) files are kept in faster-performing SSDs, while less critical ones can be moved to slower HDDs or even cloud object stores when not actively used for cheaper costs and space savings.

6. Incremental Data Processing: Instead of storing all user media data directly on the database servers at scale (e.g., 30 TB/day), consider using services like AWS Glacier, Google Cloud Storage's archive bucket or Azure Blob Archive that are designed for long-term storage and only move relevant file copies to primary storages when a specific trigger is met in case of urgent retrieval requirement while saving costs on unnecessary data duplication.

7. Data Deduplication at the Message Store Level: At Kafka, where messages are stored before being sent out as group messaging (a common pattern), deduplicate message deliveries to ensure that multiple copies aren't created for each user in a chat when replicated across different brokers/nodes within your cluster.

These methods would need further consideration during the detailed system design phase, including performance trade-offs and costs analysis since optimizing storage is not just about saving space but also maintaining fast access times essential to ensure low latency message delivery as required by WhatsApp'ner functionality specifications mentioned above in your project.",No,No
Is there any mention of optimizing average CPU utilization?,"Consistency: Messages should be delivered in the order they were sent.
Availability: The system should be highly available. However, the availability can be compromised in the interest of consistency.
Security: The system must be secure via end-to-end encryption. The end-to-end encryption ensures that only the two communicating parties can see the content of messages. Nobody in between, not even WhatsApp, should have access.
Scalability: The system should be highly scalable to support an ever-increasing number of users and messages per day.
Capacity Estimation
Storage Estimation:
100 billion messages are shared through WhatsApp per day and each message takes 100 bytes on average
100 billion/day∗100 Bytes = 10 TB/day
For 30 days, the storage capacity would become the following:

---

Bandwidth Estimation:
According to the storage capacity estimation, our service will get 10TB of data each day, giving us a bandwidth of 926 Mb/s.
10 TB/86400sec ≈ 926Mb/s

Number of servers estimation:
WhatsApp handles around 10 million connections on a single server, which seems quite high for a server.
No. of servers = Total connections per day/No. of connections per server = 2 billion/10 million = 200 servers
So, according to the above estimates, we require 200 chat servers.

Requirements
The WhatsApp messenger design should meet below requirements:

---

Functional Requirement
Conversation: The system should support one-on-one and group conversations between users.
Acknowledgment: The system should support message delivery acknowledgment, such as sent, delivered, and read.
Sharing: The system should support sharing of media files, such as images, videos, and audio.
Chat storage: The system must support the persistent storage of chat messages when a user is offline until the successful delivery of messages.
Push notifications: The system should be able to notify offline users of new messages once their status becomes online.
Non-Functional Requirement
Low latency: Users should be able to receive messages with low latency.
Consistency: Messages should be delivered in the order they were sent.

Now, here comes the responsibility of the group service. The group service keeps all information about users in each group in the system. It has all the information about each group, including user IDs, group ID, status, group icon, number of users, and so on. This service resides on top of the MySQL database cluster, with multiple secondary replicas distributed geographically. A Redis cache server also exists to cache data from the MySQL servers. Both geographically distributed replicas and Redis cache aid in reducing latency.

The group message handler communicates with the group service to retrieve data of Group/A users. In the last step, the group message handler follows the same process as a WebSocket server and delivers the message to each user.

---

4. Support for Group messages
Since user A is connected to a WebSocket server, it sends a message to the message service intended for Group A.The message service sends the message to Kafka with other specific information about the group. The message is saved there for further processing. In Kafka terminology, a group can be a topic, and the senders and receivers can be producers and consumers, respectively.

User A and user B create a communication channel with the chat server.
User A sends a message to the chat server.
Upon receiving the message, the chat server acknowledges back to user A.
The chat server sends the message to user B and stores the message in the database if the receiver’s status is offline.
User B sends an acknowledgment to the chat server.
The chat server notifies user A that the message has been successfully delivered.
When user B reads the message, the application notifies the chat server.
The chat server notifies user A that user B has read the message.

The responsibility of each of these servers is to provide a port to every online user. The mapping between servers, ports, and users is stored in the WebSocket manager that resides on top of a cluster of the data store. In this case, that’s Redis.

2. Send or receive messages
The WebSocket manager is responsible for maintaining a mapping between an active user and a port assigned to the user. Whenever a user is connected to another WebSocket server, this information will be updated in the data store. A WebSocket server also communicates with another service called message service.

30∗10 TB/day = 300 TB/month",127.14869666099548," No, there is no specific discussion in your provided document regarding how to manage or mitigate peak CPU utilization. To handle high load effectively and maintain performance during peaks, you would typically need a robust scalability strategy for the system infrastructure.

In WhatsApp's case (or similar real-time messaging platforms), such strategies often include:

1. **Horizontal Scaling** - Adding more servers to distribute traffic evenly across multiple instances and handle increased load during peak times effectively. This is aligned with the microservices architecture approach mentioned in your document, which suggests scaling out by adding new WebSocket server nodes or increasing capacity on existing ones based on demand metrics like CPU utilization.

2. **Load Balancing** - Distributing incoming connections across a pool of websocket servers to prevent any single instance from becoming overloaded ensures that no individual resource is under more strain than it can handle, which helps in maintaining system responsiveness and reliability during traffic spikes.

3. endpoints or service tiers (such as caching layers with Redis) efficiently offloads repetitive processing tasks like frequently accessed data retrievals from the main application logic to improve overall performance under load without explicitly mentioning CPU utilization management in your document. However, this approach indirectly helps manage resource consumption by minimizing unnecessary work on each server instance during high traffic periods.

4. **Quality of Service (QoS)** - Implement rate limiting or back-pressure mechanisms to prevent any single user from consuming resources that might lead to degraded performance for others, although this is not directly mentioned in your document either. These techniques help maintain a responsive service even when there are high traffic volumes by managing how fast users can send messages and request media downloads during peak times.

5. **Asynchronous Processing** - Some operations that do not require immediate response or synchronous processing might be moved to background jobs, allowing the system's interactive components (like a user sending/receiving messages) to remain responsive even when other work is being processed in parallel on different threads or processes within each server instance.

6. **Resource Optimization** - Ensure that code paths are optimized and unnecessary computations minimized, which can reduce CPU load during peak times without specifically stating it as a strategy for managing peaks in the provided document. This might involve profiling applications to find hotspots or bottlenecks where performance could be improved through more efficient algorithms or data structures.

7. **Dynamic Resource Provision** - Utilizing cloud services that allow dynamic allocation of resources, such as auto-scaling groups and elastic load balancers (ELB), which can automatically scale the number of websocket server instances up or down based on real-time demand metrics without being explicitly detailed in your document.

It is important to note that managing peak CPU utilization usually involves continuous monitoring, proactive scaling strategies as well as fallback mechanisms such as queueing systems (not discussed here) where messages are held temporarily during extremely high loads rather than dropping them or delaying delivery significantly until the load decreases.

2. **Load Balancing** - Distributing incoming connections across a pool of websocket servers to prevent any single instance from becoming overloaded ensures that no individual resource is under more strain than it can handle, which helps in maintaining system responsiveness and reliability during traffic spikes.

3. endpoints or service tiers (such as caching layers with Redis) efficiently offloads repetitive processing tasks like frequently accessed data retrievals from the main application logic to improve overall performance under load without explicitly mentioning CPU utilization management in your document. However, this approach indirectly helps manage resource consumption by minimizing unnecessary work on each server instance during high traffic periods.

4. **Quality of Service (QoS)** - Implement rate limiting or back-pressure mechanisms to prevent any single user from consuming resources that might lead to degraded performance for others, although this is not directly mentioned in your document either. These techniques help maintain a responsive service even when there are high traffic volumes by managing how fast users can send messages and request media downloads during peak times.

5. **Asynchronous Processing** - Some operations that do not require immediate response or synchronous processing might be moved to background jobs, allowing the system's interactive components (like a user sending/receiving messages) to remain responsive even when other work is being processed in parallel on different threads or processes within each server instance.

6. **Resource Optimization** - Ensure that code paths are optimized and unnecessary computations minimized, which can reduce CPU load during peak times without specifically stating it as a strategy for managing peaks in the provided document. This might involve profiling applications to find hotspots or bottlenecks where performance could be improved through more efficient algorithms or data structures.

7. **Dynamic Resource Provision** - Utilizing cloud services that allow dynamic allocation of resources, such as auto-scaling groups and elastic load balancers (ELB), which can automatically scale the number of websocket server instances up or down based on real-time demand metrics without being explicitly detailed in your document.

It is important to note that managing peak CPU utilization usually involves continuous monitoring, proactive scaling strategies as well as fallback mechanisms such as queueing systems (not discussed here) where messages are held temporarily during extremely high loads rather than dropping them or delaying delivery significantly until the load decreases.

To properly address this aspect of system design in WhatsApp messenger, one would need to delve into cloud infrastructure capabilities and performance engineering techniques that ensure responsiveness under varying traffic patterns but which are not covered by your provided document content.",No,No
Is there any mention of removing unused assets?,"Consistency: Messages should be delivered in the order they were sent.
Availability: The system should be highly available. However, the availability can be compromised in the interest of consistency.
Security: The system must be secure via end-to-end encryption. The end-to-end encryption ensures that only the two communicating parties can see the content of messages. Nobody in between, not even WhatsApp, should have access.
Scalability: The system should be highly scalable to support an ever-increasing number of users and messages per day.
Capacity Estimation
Storage Estimation:
100 billion messages are shared through WhatsApp per day and each message takes 100 bytes on average
100 billion/day∗100 Bytes = 10 TB/day
For 30 days, the storage capacity would become the following:

---

Bandwidth Estimation:
According to the storage capacity estimation, our service will get 10TB of data each day, giving us a bandwidth of 926 Mb/s.
10 TB/86400sec ≈ 926Mb/s

Number of servers estimation:
WhatsApp handles around 10 million connections on a single server, which seems quite high for a server.
No. of servers = Total connections per day/No. of connections per server = 2 billion/10 million = 200 servers
So, according to the above estimates, we require 200 chat servers.

Requirements
The WhatsApp messenger design should meet below requirements:

---

Functional Requirement
Conversation: The system should support one-on-one and group conversations between users.
Acknowledgment: The system should support message delivery acknowledgment, such as sent, delivered, and read.
Sharing: The system should support sharing of media files, such as images, videos, and audio.
Chat storage: The system must support the persistent storage of chat messages when a user is offline until the successful delivery of messages.
Push notifications: The system should be able to notify offline users of new messages once their status becomes online.
Non-Functional Requirement
Low latency: Users should be able to receive messages with low latency.
Consistency: Messages should be delivered in the order they were sent.

Now, here comes the responsibility of the group service. The group service keeps all information about users in each group in the system. It has all the information about each group, including user IDs, group ID, status, group icon, number of users, and so on. This service resides on top of the MySQL database cluster, with multiple secondary replicas distributed geographically. A Redis cache server also exists to cache data from the MySQL servers. Both geographically distributed replicas and Redis cache aid in reducing latency.

The group message handler communicates with the group service to retrieve data of Group/A users. In the last step, the group message handler follows the same process as a WebSocket server and delivers the message to each user.

---

4. Support for Group messages
Since user A is connected to a WebSocket server, it sends a message to the message service intended for Group A.The message service sends the message to Kafka with other specific information about the group. The message is saved there for further processing. In Kafka terminology, a group can be a topic, and the senders and receivers can be producers and consumers, respectively.

The following steps describe the communication between both clients:

User A and user B create a communication channel with the chat server.
User A sends a message to the chat server.
Upon receiving the message, the chat server acknowledges back to user A.
The chat server sends the message to user B and stores the message in the database if the receiver’s status is offline.
User B sends an acknowledgment to the chat server.
The chat server notifies user A that the message has been successfully delivered.
When user B reads the message, the application notifies the chat server.
The chat server notifies user A that user B has read the message.

Capacity Estimation
Storage Estimation:
100 billion messages are shared through WhatsApp per day and each message takes 100 bytes on average
100 billion/day∗100 Bytes = 10 TB/day
For 30 days, the storage capacity would become the following:

---

Bandwidth Estimation:
According to the storage capacity estimation, our service will get 10TB of data each day, giving us a bandwidth of 926 Mb/s.
10 TB/86400sec ≈ 926Mb/s

Number of servers estimation:
WhatsApp handles around 10 million connections on a single server, which seems quite high for a server.
No. of servers = Total connections per day/No. of connections per server = 2 billion/10 million = 200 servers
So, according to the above estimates, we require 200 chat servers.

Data Model Design:

Approach to achieve the below system attributes
Requirements
The WhatsApp messenger design should meet below requirements:

---

Functional Requirement
Conversation: The system should support one-on-one and group conversations between users.
Acknowledgment: The system should support message delivery acknowledgment, such as sent, delivered, and read.
Sharing: The system should support sharing of media files, such as images, videos, and audio.
Chat storage: The system must support the persistent storage of chat messages when a user is offline until the successful delivery of messages.
Push notifications: The system should be able to notify offline users of new messages once their status becomes online.
Non-Functional Requirement
Low latency: Users should be able to receive messages with low latency.
Consistency: Messages should be delivered in the order they were sent.

---

Now, here comes the responsibility of the group service. The group service keeps all information about users in each group in the system. It has all the information about each group, including user IDs, group ID, status, group icon, number of users, and so on. This service resides on top of the MySQL database cluster, with multiple secondary replicas distributed geographically. A Redis cache server also exists to cache data from the MySQL servers. Both geographically distributed replicas and Redis cache aid in reducing latency.

The group message handler communicates with the group service to retrieve data of Group/A users. In the last step, the group message handler follows the same process as a WebSocket server and delivers the message to each user.

---

4. Support for Group messages
Since user A is connected to a WebSocket server, it sends a message to the message service intended for Group A.The message service sends the message to Kafka with other specific information about the group. The message is saved there for further processing. In Kafka terminology, a group can be a topic, and the senders and receivers can be producers and consumers, respectively.

---

API Design
Send message
sendMessage(message_ID, sender_ID, reciever_ID, type, text=none, media_object=none, document=none)

---

The following steps describe the communication between both clients:

User A and user B create a communication channel with the chat server.
User A sends a message to the chat server.
Upon receiving the message, the chat server acknowledges back to user A.
The chat server sends the message to user B and stores the message in the database if the receiver’s status is offline.
User B sends an acknowledgment to the chat server.
The chat server notifies user A that the message has been successfully delivered.
When user B reads the message, the application notifies the chat server.
The chat server notifies user A that user B has read the message.
Data Model Design:
Data-Model-Design

---

The responsibility of each of these servers is to provide a port to every online user. The mapping between servers, ports, and users is stored in the WebSocket manager that resides on top of a cluster of the data store. In this case, that’s Redis.

2. Send or receive messages
The WebSocket manager is responsible for maintaining a mapping between an active user and a port assigned to the user. Whenever a user is connected to another WebSocket server, this information will be updated in the data store. A WebSocket server also communicates with another service called message service.

For 30 days, the storage capacity would become the following:
30∗10 TB/day = 300 TB/month",119.10194849967957," The document does not explicitly state that WhatsApp's infrastructure scales in real-time according to user demand. However, given the need for handling about two billion messages daily and serving around 10 million concurrent connections (assuming each message takes negligible time), it can be inferred that WhatsApp employs auto-scaling techniques within its architecture. The presence of multiple servers across different geographic locations implies a distributed system designed to manage load distribution effectively, which is key for scaling based on real-time user demand and ensuring low latency as one non-functional requirement outlined in the document emphasizes that users should receive messages with low latency.

The mention of multiple secondary replicas ""distributed geographically"" within the MySQL database cluster indicates an effort to reduce data access time across various regions, which is a strategy often used by systems needing high availability and scalable infrastructure based on user demand or activity spikes. Additionally, leveraging Redis as cache for frequently accessed but less critical information (like group details) allows quick retrieval that could potentially be part of the auto-scaling logic to prioritize resources efficiently during peak times.

However, without specific mention in this document about real-time scaling mechanisms or how WhatsApp dynamically scales its server count based on live user demand metrics such as active users and concurrent connections, we cannot definitively conclude that there is a detailed description of the system's auto-scaling infrastructure within it. Typically for robust systems like WhatsApp, although not necessarily disclosed in public documentation to this extent due to security concerns or proprietary methodologies, real-time scaling would be implemented through sophsisticated load balancing and resource allocation strategies using cloud services that offer such capabilities (like AWS Auto Scaling Groups), which can automatically adjust the number of instances based on defined policies.",44.40207314491272,0,"[Document(page_content='Consistency: Messages should be delivered in the order they were sent.\nAvailability: The system should be highly available.

In WhatsApp, each active device is connected with a WebSocket server via WebSocket protocol. A WebSocket server keeps the connection open with all the active (online) users. Since one server isn’t enough to handle billions of devices, there should be enough servers to handle billions of users.

---

Bandwidth Estimation:
According to the storage capacity estimation, our service will get 10TB of data each day, giving us a bandwidth of 926 Mb/s.
10 TB/86400sec ≈ 926Mb/s

Number of servers estimation:
WhatsApp handles around 10 million connections on a single server, which seems quite high for a server.
No. of servers = Total connections per day/No. of connections per server = 2 billion/10 million = 200 servers
So, according to the above estimates, we require 200 chat servers.

Approach to achieve the below system attributes
Requirements
The WhatsApp messenger design should meet below requirements:

---

Functional Requirement
Conversation: The system should support one-on-one and group conversations between users.
Acknowledgment: The system should support message delivery acknowledgment, such as sent, delivered, and read.
Sharing: The system should support sharing of media files, such as images, videos, and audio.
Chat storage: The system must support the persistent storage of chat messages when a user is offline until the successful delivery of messages.
Push notifications: The system should be able to notify offline users of new messages once their status becomes online.
Non-Functional Requirement
Low latency: Users should be able to receive messages with low latency.
Consistency: Messages should be delivered in the order they were sent.

---

Now, here comes the responsibility of the group service. The group service keeps all information about users in each group in the system. It has all the information about each group, including user IDs, group ID, status, group icon, number of users, and so on. This service resides on top of the MySQL database cluster, with multiple secondary replicas distributed geographically. A Redis cache server also exists to cache data from the MySQL servers. Both geographically distributed replicas and Redis cache aid in reducing latency.

The group message handler communicates with the group service to retrieve data of Group/A users. In the last step, the group message handler follows the same process as a WebSocket server and delivers the message to each user.

---

4. Support for Group messages
Since user A is connected to a WebSocket server, it sends a message to the message service intended for Group A.The message service sends the message to Kafka with other specific information about the group. The message is saved there for further processing. In Kafka terminology, a group can be a topic, and the senders and receivers can be producers and consumers, respectively.

API Design
Send message
sendMessage(message_ID, sender_ID, reciever_ID, type, text=none, media_object=none, document=none)

The following steps describe the communication between both clients:

User A and user B create a communication channel with the chat server.
User A sends a message to the chat server.
Upon receiving the message, the chat server acknowledges back to user A.
The chat server sends the message to user B and stores the message in the database if the receiver’s status is offline.
User B sends an acknowledgment to the chat server.
The chat server notifies user A that the message has been successfully delivered.
When user B reads the message, the application notifies the chat server.
The chat server notifies user A that user B has read the message.

The responsibility of each of these servers is to provide a port to every online user. The mapping between servers, ports, and users is stored in the WebSocket manager that resides on top of a cluster of the data store. In this case, that’s Redis.

2. Send or receive messages
The WebSocket manager is responsible for maintaining a mapping between an active user and a port assigned to the user. Whenever a user is connected to another WebSocket server, this information will be updated in the data store. A WebSocket server also communicates with another service called message service.

1. Connection with Websocket Server
In WhatsApp, each active device is connected with a WebSocket server via WebSocket protocol. A WebSocket server keeps the connection open with all the active (online) users. Since one server isn’t enough to handle billions of devices, there should be enough servers to handle billions of users.

---

The media file is compressed and encrypted on the device side.
The compressed and encrypted file is sent to the asset service to store the file on blob storage.
The asset service assigns an ID that’s communicated with the sender. The asset service also maintains a hash for each file to avoid duplication of content on the blob storage.
For example, if a user wants to upload an image that’s already there in the blob storage, the image won’t be uploaded. Instead, the same ID is forwarded to the receiver.
The asset service sends the ID of media files to the receiver via the message service. The receiver downloads the media file from the blob storage using the ID.
The content is loaded onto a CDN if the asset service receives a large number of requests for some particular content.

---

The responsibility of each of these servers is to provide a port to every online user. The mapping between servers, ports, and users is stored in the WebSocket manager that resides on top of a cluster of the data store. In this case, that’s Redis.

2. Send or receive messages
The WebSocket manager is responsible for maintaining a mapping between an active user and a port assigned to the user. Whenever a user is connected to another WebSocket server, this information will be updated in the data store. A WebSocket server also communicates with another service called message service.",128.63775181770325," The provided document outlines various aspects and requirements for designing an advanced messaging system similar to WhatsApp but doesn't explicitly focus on methods or technologies specifically aimed at ""reducing the amount of transmitted data."" However, within this context and based on general knowledge about optimizing network traffic in communication systems:

1. **Data Compression** - The document mentions that media files are compressed before being sent to the asset service for storage (""The media file is compressed...""). This implies an attempt to reduce their size pre-transmission, thereby reducing bandwidth usage. Similarly, it hints at a system where messages might be stored and possibly also compressed in Kafka as they're queued up for delivery (the message handler interacts with Kafka before delivering the content through WebSockets).

2. **Media Serving from CDN** - For frequently requested media files, which would presumably include a significant amount of data being sent to and received by users (""...and maintains a hash for each file to avoid duplication..., The asset service sends the ID of media files to the receiver via the message service.""), content is loaded onto a Content Delivery Network (CDN). CDNs are designed to reduce latency and decrease load times by caching static resources closer to users geographically, which indirectly reduces unnecessary traffic back-and-forth between user devices and origin servers.

3. **Minimal Data Transfer for Status Updates** - The document implies that status updates (such as acknowledging the receipt of a message or notifying about read messages) are communicated efficiently (""User B sends an acknowledgment to the chat server...""). This suggests using minimal data transfer when possible, though specific strategies aren't detailed.

4. **Deduplication** - Through deduplication mechanisms at various points in the system (e.g., avoiding duplication of media content), unnecessary transmissions are prevented, thus conserving bandwidth and reducing total data transfer amounts within certain interactions like exchanging messages with attached media files (""...The asset service sends the ID of media files to the receiver via the message service."").

While these points touch on strategies that could reduce data transmission needs, they are inferred rather than explicitly detailed in your provided document. To focus specifically on reducing transmitted data within a messaging system like WhatsApp or similar platforms would require explicit design decisions around compression algorithms (beyond what's described), efficient deduplication mechanisms for media and non-time-sensitive text, and potentially protocol optimizations that minimize overhead in message exchanges.",55.48583698272705,0,"[Document(page_content='Consistency: Messages should be delivered in the order they were sent.\nAvailability: The system should be highly available.

However, within this context and based on general knowledge about optimizing network traffic in communication systems:

1. **Data Compression** - The document mentions that media files are compressed before being sent to the asset service for storage (""The media file is compressed...""). This implies an attempt to reduce their size pre-transmission, thereby reducing bandwidth usage. Similarly, it hints at a system where messages might be stored and possibly also compressed in Kafka as they're queued up for delivery (the message handler interacts with Kafka before delivering the content through WebSockets).

2. **Media Serving from CDN** - For frequently requested media files, which would presumably include a significant amount of data being sent to and received by users (""...and maintains a hash for each file to avoid duplication..., The asset service sends the ID of media files to the receiver via the message service.""), content is loaded onto a Content Delivery Network (CDN). CDNs are designed to reduce latency and decrease load times by caching static resources closer to users geographically, which indirectly reduces unnecessary traffic back-and-forth between user devices and origin servers.

3. **Minimal Data Transfer for Status Updates** - The document implies that status updates (such as acknowledging the receipt of a message or notifying about read messages) are communicated efficiently (""User B sends an acknowledgment to the chat server...""). This suggests using minimal data transfer when possible, though specific strategies aren't detailed.

4. **Deduplication** - Through deduplication mechanisms at various points in the system (e.g., avoiding duplication of media content), unnecessary transmissions are prevented, thus conserving bandwidth and reducing total data transfer amounts within certain interactions like exchanging messages with attached media files (""...The asset service sends the ID of media files to the receiver via the message service."").

While these points touch on strategies that could reduce data transmission needs, they are inferred rather than explicitly detailed in your provided document. To focus specifically on reducing transmitted data within a messaging system like WhatsApp or similar platforms would require explicit design decisions around compression algorithms (beyond what's described), efficient deduplication mechanisms for media and non-time-sensitive text, and potentially protocol optimizations that minimize overhead in message exchanges.",No,No
Is there any mention of setting storage retention policies?,"Consistency: Messages should be delivered in the order they were sent.
Availability: The system should be highly available. However, the availability can be compromised in the interest of consistency.
Security: The system must be secure via end-to-end encryption. The end-to-end encryption ensures that only the two communicating parties can see the content of messages. Nobody in between, not even WhatsApp, should have access.
Scalability: The system should be highly scalable to support an ever-increasing number of users and messages per day.
Capacity Estimation
Storage Estimation:
100 billion messages are shared through WhatsApp per day and each message takes 100 bytes on average
100 billion/day∗100 Bytes = 10 TB/day
For 30 days, the storage capacity would become the following:

---

Bandwidth Estimation:
According to the storage capacity estimation, our service will get 10TB of data each day, giving us a bandwidth of 926 Mb/s.
10 TB/86400sec ≈ 926Mb/s

Number of servers estimation:
WhatsApp handles around 10 million connections on a single server, which seems quite high for a server.
No. of servers = Total connections per day/No. of connections per server = 2 billion/10 million = 200 servers
So, according to the above estimates, we require 200 chat servers.

Requirements
The WhatsApp messenger design should meet below requirements:

---

Functional Requirement
Conversation: The system should support one-on-one and group conversations between users.
Acknowledgment: The system should support message delivery acknowledgment, such as sent, delivered, and read.
Sharing: The system should support sharing of media files, such as images, videos, and audio.
Chat storage: The system must support the persistent storage of chat messages when a user is offline until the successful delivery of messages.
Push notifications: The system should be able to notify offline users of new messages once their status becomes online.
Non-Functional Requirement
Low latency: Users should be able to receive messages with low latency.
Consistency: Messages should be delivered in the order they were sent.

Now, here comes the responsibility of the group service. The group service keeps all information about users in each group in the system. It has all the information about each group, including user IDs, group ID, status, group icon, number of users, and so on. This service resides on top of the MySQL database cluster, with multiple secondary replicas distributed geographically. A Redis cache server also exists to cache data from the MySQL servers. Both geographically distributed replicas and Redis cache aid in reducing latency.

The group message handler communicates with the group service to retrieve data of Group/A users. In the last step, the group message handler follows the same process as a WebSocket server and delivers the message to each user.

---

4. Support for Group messages
Since user A is connected to a WebSocket server, it sends a message to the message service intended for Group A.The message service sends the message to Kafka with other specific information about the group. The message is saved there for further processing. In Kafka terminology, a group can be a topic, and the senders and receivers can be producers and consumers, respectively.

User A and user B create a communication channel with the chat server.
User A sends a message to the chat server.
Upon receiving the message, the chat server acknowledges back to user A.
The chat server sends the message to user B and stores the message in the database if the receiver’s status is offline.
User B sends an acknowledgment to the chat server.
The chat server notifies user A that the message has been successfully delivered.
When user B reads the message, the application notifies the chat server.
The chat server notifies user A that user B has read the message.

The responsibility of each of these servers is to provide a port to every online user. The mapping between servers, ports, and users is stored in the WebSocket manager that resides on top of a cluster of the data store. In this case, that’s Redis.

2. Send or receive messages
The WebSocket manager is responsible for maintaining a mapping between an active user and a port assigned to the user. Whenever a user is connected to another WebSocket server, this information will be updated in the data store. A WebSocket server also communicates with another service called message service.

Since one server isn’t enough to handle billions of devices, there should be enough servers to handle billions of users.",148.4579095840454," Based on the provided document and WhatsApp's general data handling practices as known up until 2023, it doesn't explicitly discuss specific details about message deletion or expiration within your system design overview. Typically, messaging systems like WhatsApp have mechanisms in place to manage conversation history retention based on user activity and preferences (e.g., archiving messages). However, these policies can vary across different versions of the app as well as between regional releases due to differing privacy laws.

For a system designed with similar functionality:
- Messages should persist indefinitely or for an extended period unless configured otherwise by user settings (like WhatsApp's archived conversations). 
- If data retention policies are needed, they would usually be defined according to company policy and local regulations. They can either allow the message storage as mentioned above—30 days of chat history per conversation or implement a different strategy like only storing recent messages for shorter periods (e.g., last week's chats).
- Retention policies might also consider factors such as user activity, volume of data generated by conversations involving media sharing, and the necessity to keep records in case legal issues arise that require retrieval of historical communications within a specific period before deletion or purging. 
- To accommodate these practices without mentioning them explicitly in your design document might be an oversight; hence you may want to review WhatsApp's policies, local regulations (like GDPR), and possibly include user preferences settings for data retention alongside backend implementation details on how the service manages deletion or expiration of messages based upon these rules.

To address this in your design: 
- You could define a default policy within your system's documentation regarding message storage duration before considering their automatic purging, and implement policies that can be customized by users according to local regulations if required (e.g., GDPR compliance).",45.39872145652771,0,"[Document(page_content='Consistency: Messages should be delivered in the order they were sent.\nAvailability: The system should be highly available.

However, based on standard practices and common patterns used to handle such situations, it's reasonable to infer that WhatsApp Messenger might incorporate queuing mechanisms implicitly within its services like sending messages (message service) through Kafka as described here:

---

4. Support for Group Messages & Background Task Processing Queue Design
Since user A is connected to a WebSocket server, it sends a message which is then sent via the group/chat messaging protocol towards other participants of that specific chat room or channel (either through Kafka in this case as mentioned). The initial communication may not need queuing due to its nature. However, for background tasks like cleaning up old conversations and ensuring data integrity over time without impacting user experience:

Background Message Cleanup Task Queue Design – A simple conceptual design could be implemented here using a service responsible for periodically purging expired messages or performing maintenance on the database/cache (Redis in this case). This background task would not need immediate acknowledgment but must ensure that any necessary data is preserved before deletion to maintain message delivery guarantees.
---",No,No
Is there any mention of prioritizing critical traffic and shedding lower priority traffic?,"Consistency: Messages should be delivered in the order they were sent.
Availability: The system should be highly available. However, the availability can be compromised in the interest of consistency.
Security: The system must be secure via end-to-end encryption. The end-to-end encryption ensures that only the two communicating parties can see the content of messages. Nobody in between, not even WhatsApp, should have access.
Scalability: The system should be highly scalable to support an ever-increasing number of users and messages per day.
Capacity Estimation
Storage Estimation:
100 billion messages are shared through WhatsApp per day and each message takes 100 bytes on average
100 billion/day∗100 Bytes = 10 TB/day
For 30 days, the storage capacity would become the following:

---

Bandwidth Estimation:
According to the storage capacity estimation, our service will get 10TB of data each day, giving us a bandwidth of 926 Mb/s.
10 TB/86400sec ≈ 926Mb/s

Number of servers estimation:
WhatsApp handles around 10 million connections on a single server, which seems quite high for a server.
No. of servers = Total connections per day/No. of connections per server = 2 billion/10 million = 200 servers
So, according to the above estimates, we require 200 chat servers.

Conversation: The system should support one-on-one and group conversations between users.
Acknowledgment: The system should support message delivery acknowledgment, such as sent, delivered, and read.
Sharing: The system should support sharing of media files, such as images, videos, and audio.
Chat storage: The system must support the persistent storage of chat messages when a user is offline until the successful delivery of messages.
Push notifications: The system should be able to notify offline users of new messages once their status becomes online.
Non-Functional Requirement
Low latency: Users should be able to receive messages with low latency.
Consistency: Messages should be delivered in the order they were sent.

Now, here comes the responsibility of the group service. The group service keeps all information about users in each group in the system. It has all the information about each group, including user IDs, group ID, status, group icon, number of users, and so on. This service resides on top of the MySQL database cluster, with multiple secondary replicas distributed geographically. A Redis cache server also exists to cache data from the MySQL servers. Both geographically distributed replicas and Redis cache aid in reducing latency.

The group message handler communicates with the group service to retrieve data of Group/A users. In the last step, the group message handler follows the same process as a WebSocket server and delivers the message to each user.

User A sends a message to the chat server.
Upon receiving the message, the chat server acknowledges back to user A.
The chat server sends the message to user B and stores the message in the database if the receiver’s status is offline.
User B sends an acknowledgment to the chat server.
The chat server notifies user A that the message has been successfully delivered.
When user B reads the message, the application notifies the chat server.
The chat server notifies user A that user B has read the message.

30∗10 TB/day = 300 TB/month",110.5603485107422," Based on your description and requirements for WhatsApp Messenger system design, I can understand that you aim to create a scalable messaging platform. However, the information provided doesn't explicitly discuss whether asynchronous or synchronous networking is employed within each client-server interaction as detailed in steps 1 through 4.

In modern web applications and systems like WhatsApp Messenger, where real-time communication plays a vital role, it’s common to use WebSockets for the continuous exchange of messages between clients (users) and servers because they can send data back and forth without repeatedly establishing new connections – which is more efficient than using HTTP polling in terms of network traffic.

Here are some key aspects concerning asynchronous networking calls, typically employed by WhatsApp-like systems:

1. **Asynchronous Operations** - WebSocket communication inherently supports both synchronous and asynchronous operations since it's a full-duplex channel over the web transport (TCP). This means that messages can be sent and received in real time without waiting for responses, which is essential when acknowledgments are necessary to keep track of message statuses.

2. **Use Cases** - In your system design steps:
    a) Acknowledgment should happen almost immediately after sending or receiving the actual messages but can be done asynchronously if you want more flexibility in handling user interactions without freezing their interface (e.g., using Promises, async/await syntax).
    b) For push notifications about new messages when users become online again, asynchronous callbacks could notify them since this is a separate process from the actual message delivery workflow which would be synchronous to avoid delays in notification while maintaining low latency for other operations.
    c) Non-functional requirements like consistency and low latency suggest using optimizations such as caching (like Redis), load balancing, and employing efficient serialization/deserialization methods which can also leverage asynchronous patterns to improve performance without blocking main execution threads unnecessarily.
    
3. **Consistency** - It's vital for the system to maintain consistency in message delivery order as per Non-Functional Requirement, this may involve employing different strategies like using sequence numbers or timestamps and ensuring that these are used effectively when messages arrive at their destination out of order.

However, the information provided doesn't explicitly discuss whether asynchronous or synchronous networking is employed within each client-server interaction as detailed in steps 1 through 4.

In modern web applications and systems like WhatsApp Messenger, where real-time communication plays a vital role, it’s common to use WebSockets for the continuous exchange of messages between clients (users) and servers because they can send data back and forth without repeatedly establishing new connections – which is more efficient than using HTTP polling in terms of network traffic.

Here are some key aspects concerning asynchronous networking calls, typically employed by WhatsApp-like systems:

1. **Asynchronous Operations** - WebSocket communication inherently supports both synchronous and asynchronous operations since it's a full-duplex channel over the web transport (TCP). This means that messages can be sent and received in real time without waiting for responses, which is essential when acknowledgments are necessary to keep track of message statuses.

2. **Use Cases** - In your system design steps:
    a) Acknowledgment should happen almost immediately after sending or receiving the actual messages but can be done asynchronously if you want more flexibility in handling user interactions without freezing their interface (e.g., using Promises, async/await syntax).
    b) For push notifications about new messages when users become online again, asynchronous callbacks could notify them since this is a separate process from the actual message delivery workflow which would be synchronous to avoid delays in notification while maintaining low latency for other operations.
    c) Non-functional requirements like consistency and low latency suggest using optimizations such as caching (like Redis), load balancing, and employing efficient serialization/deserialization methods which can also leverage asynchronous patterns to improve performance without blocking main execution threads unnecessarily.

Bandwidth Estimation:
According to the storage capacity estimation, our service will get 10TB of data each day, giving us a bandwidth of 926 Mb/s.
10 TB/86400sec ≈ 926Mb/s

Number of servers estimation:
WhatsApp handles around 10 million connections on a single server, which seems quite high for a server.
No. of servers = Total connections per day/No. of connections per server = 2 billion/10 million = 200 servers
So, according to the above estimates, we require 200 chat servers.

1. Connection with Websocket Server
In WhatsApp, each active device is connected with a WebSocket server via WebSocket protocol. A WebSocket server keeps the connection open with all the active (online) users. Since one server isn’t enough to handle billions of devices, there should be enough servers to handle billions of users.

The media file is compressed and encrypted on the device side.
The compressed and encrypted file is sent to the asset service to store the file on blob storage.
The asset service assigns an ID that’s communicated with the sender. The asset service also maintains a hash for each file to avoid duplication of content on the blob storage.
For example, if a user wants to upload an image that’s already there in the blob storage, the image won’t be uploaded. Instead, the same ID is forwarded to the receiver.
The asset service sends the ID of media files to the receiver via the message service. The receiver downloads the media file from the blob storage using the ID.
The content is loaded onto a CDN if the asset service receives a large number of requests for some particular content.

This API is used to send a text message from a sender to a receiver by making a POST API call to the /messages API endpoint. Generally, the sender’s and receiver’s IDs are their phone numbers.

Get Message
getMessage(user_Id)

Using this API call, users can fetch all unread messages when they come online after being offline for some time.

Upload File
uploadFile(file_type, file)

We can upload media files via the uploadFile API by making a POST request to the /v1/media API endpoint. A successful response returns an ID that’s forwarded to the receiver.

However, best practices in software development emphasize regular code reviews, static analysis tools, dynamic application security testing (DAST), and penetration testing as key components of vulnerability management strategies that can help identify potential issues before they become exploitable by attackers.

Additionally, systems often employ a combination of automated scanning for known vulnerabilities using databases like the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) list and manual code reviews to catch more nuanced security concerns not covered in automatic tools or identified through system monitoring processes. While these activities are implied as part of maintaining robust application performance, they may also contribute significantly towards securing a messaging platform against potential threats by ensuring timely patches for discovered vulnerabilities and adherence to secure coding standards throughout development lifecycles.",No,No
Is there any mention of adopting cloud-native network security tools and controls?,"Consistency: Messages should be delivered in the order they were sent.
Availability: The system should be highly available. However, the availability can be compromised in the interest of consistency.
Security: The system must be secure via end-to-end encryption. The end-to-end encryption ensures that only the two communicating parties can see the content of messages. Nobody in between, not even WhatsApp, should have access.
Scalability: The system should be highly scalable to support an ever-increasing number of users and messages per day.
Capacity Estimation
Storage Estimation:
100 billion messages are shared through WhatsApp per day and each message takes 100 bytes on average
100 billion/day∗100 Bytes = 10 TB/day
For 30 days, the storage capacity would become the following:

---

Bandwidth Estimation:
According to the storage capacity estimation, our service will get 10TB of data each day, giving us a bandwidth of 926 Mb/s.
10 TB/86400sec ≈ 926Mb/s

Number of servers estimation:
WhatsApp handles around 10 million connections on a single server, which seems quite high for a server.
No. of servers = Total connections per day/No. of connections per server = 2 billion/10 million = 200 servers
So, according to the above estimates, we require 200 chat servers.

Conversation: The system should support one-on-one and group conversations between users.
Acknowledgment: The system should support message delivery acknowledgment, such as sent, delivered, and read.
Sharing: The system should support sharing of media files, such as images, videos, and audio.

Push notifications: The system should be able to notify offline users of new messages once their status becomes online.
Non-Functional Requirement
Low latency: Users should be able to receive messages with low latency.
Consistency: Messages should be delivered in the order they were sent.

Now, here comes the responsibility of the group service. The group service keeps all information about users in each group in the system. It has all the information about each group, including user IDs, group ID, status, group icon, number of users, and so on. This service resides on top of the MySQL database cluster, with multiple secondary replicas distributed geographically. A Redis cache server also exists to cache data from the MySQL servers. Both geographically distributed replicas and Redis cache aid in reducing latency.

The group message handler communicates with the group service to retrieve data of Group/A users. In the last step, the group message handler follows the same process as a WebSocket server and delivers the message to each user.

4. Support for Group messages
Since user A is connected to a WebSocket server, it sends a message to the message service intended for Group A.The message service sends the message to Kafka with other specific information about the group.

Low Level Design (LLD) of System Design
Low-Level-Design(LLD)-of-WhatsApp-Messenger

1. Connection with Websocket Server
In WhatsApp, each active device is connected with a WebSocket server via WebSocket protocol. A WebSocket server keeps the connection open with all the active (online) users. Since one server isn’t enough to handle billions of devices, there should be enough servers to handle billions of users.

---

The responsibility of each of these servers is to provide a port to every online user. The mapping between servers, ports, and users is stored in the WebSocket manager that resides on top of a cluster of the data store. In this case, that’s Redis.

2. Send or receive messages
The WebSocket manager is responsible for maintaining a mapping between an active user and a port assigned to the user. Whenever a user is connected to another WebSocket server, this information will be updated in the data store. A WebSocket server also communicates with another service called message service.",123.72182536125185," The provided WhatsApp Messenger system design document does not explicitly mention adoption of cloud-native network security tools and controls within the excerpts you've shared. However, it is critical to consider that in a comprehensive architectural plan for any messaging platform like WhatsApp—especially when scaling up to handle billions of devices as hinted at towards handling numerous users via web sockets servers with data stored on Redis and MySQL clusters distributed geographically through Kafka topics - network security becomes paramount.

Here's a conceptual approach that could be integrated into the design, even though it is not directly mentioned:

1. **Secure Communication Channels**: WhatsApp communicates via WebSockets over TLS/SSL to ensure data encryption in transit between clients and servers. This would need explicit mentions of using HTTPS with proper SSL certificates for end-to0ffice communication security.

2. **Authentication & Authorization**: Since the system design supports one-on-one and group chats, it needs robust authentication mechanisms like OAuth or OpenID Connect to manage user sessions securely within a browser context while employing strong password policies for server access as well (SSH keys). Additionally, role-based authorization should be implemented.

3. **Data Security**: At rest encryption using AES and at transit through SSL/TLS is crucial. Integrity checks like HMAC or SHA256 might also ensure that the message has not been tampered with in transit, which would need to be mentioned explicitly for security assurance measures within data handling processes of WebSocket communication as well.

4. **Third-party Access**: WhatsApp allows third-party applications and servers via its API integration but they must adhere to strict security policies regarding how they handle user data, which typically involves the use of secure tokens like JWTs or OAuth access tokens with refresh mechanisms for safe token handling as part of their design.

5. **Network Traffic Monitoring**: Incorporating cloud-native network monitoring and intrusion detection systems (IDS) such as Azure Sentinel, AWS GuardDuty, Google's Cloud Armor or similar solutions can help detect anomalous traffic patterns indicative of DDoS attacks or MITM attempts. This is not explicitly mentioned but would be an essential part to ensure the system resilience against network-based threats and should therefore be considered as a component in security strategy for handling user data securely on WhatsApp, especially when using Kafka distributed replicas for message delivery which adds complexity from multiple locations.

6. **Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB)**: While not explicitly mentioned, deploying cloud access brokers that act as intermediates between users and cloud services can provide an additional layer of security by enforcing data loss prevention policies on file downloads or sharing capabilities within the app design itself – which is crucial for a messaging platform dealing with media files.

7. **Regular Security Audits**: Regular automated scanning, code reviews, and penetration testing should be part of maintenance procedures to keep security patches up-to-date against known vulnerabilities - this also extends into how the system handles API endpoints which must have rate limiting in place as well.

8. **User Privacy Controls**: The document does not explicitly mention privacy controls, but implementing mechanisms like user access control for data visibility and management would be essential – ensuring users can set who sees their messages or files (and under what conditions).

In summary, while the original design description focuses on functional requirements related to message delivery within WhatsApp's infrastructure using WebSocket servers, Redis caching, MySQL databases with Kafka messaging handling and low-level websocket client implementation in JavaScript for frontend interactions – security considerations are implicit necessities that must be part of any robust system design. As such measures like adopting cloud-native network tools (e.g., Azure Sentinel or AWS GuardDuty) to safeguard against DDoS attacks and MITM attempts, employing CASB solutions for enforcing data loss prevention policies during file sharing capabilities are necessary additions that should be explicitly mentioned in a complete security strategy document which complements the provided design overview.",86.51404023170471,0,"[Document(page_content='Consistency: Messages should be delivered in the order they were sent.\nAvailability: The system should be highly available.

The responsibility of each of these servers is to provide a port to every online user. The mapping between servers, ports, and users is stored in the WebSocket manager that resides on top of a cluster of the data store. In this case, that’s Redis.

2. Send or receive messages
The WebSocket manager is responsible for maintaining a mapping between an active user and a port assigned to the user. Whenever a user is connected to another WebSocket server, this information will be updated in the data store. A WebSocket server also communicates with another service called message service.

1. Connection with Websocket Server
In WhatsApp, each active device is connected with a WebSocket server via WebSocket protocol. A WebSocket server keeps the connection open with all the active (online) users. Since one server isn’t enough to handle billions of devices, there should be enough servers to handle billions of users.",139.7627387046814," Based on the provided information about WhatsApp Messenger's system architecture in your document, it seems that particular attention has been paid to ensuring smooth user experience with a focus on low latency message delivery. This can be inferred from several non-functional requirements such as ""Low latency: Users should be able to receive messages with low latency."" and the overall goal of maintaining consistent performance standards, including delivering notifications promptly when users come online or read their messages (push notifications).

While there is no direct mention about specific software designs aimed at minimizing impact on end-user devices in terms of physical hardware wear or heat dissipation under peak loads, the system's architecture appears to be designed with efficiency and scalability in mind. By using microservices that horizontally scale across multiple servers (and potentially geographic locations), this reduces the load per server when handling massive numbers of concurrent users.

Furthermore, employing a Redis cache for frequently accessed data from MySQL databases suggests an optimization to reduce database access times and thus minimize CPU usage on user devices during message transmission or retrieval processes. The Kafka-based system for group messaging also points towards efficient handling that could potentially lessen the load by batch processing messages within groups rather than per individual, indirectly reducing stress on network communication from endpoints to some extent.

In summary, while specific strategies targeting physical device impact are not detailed in your document, several architectural and operational design choices aim at minimizing CPU/GPU loads during message handling which can contribute to a better user experience without overtaxing the devices' processing capabilities or network resources they use for WhatsApp messaging.",41.28790760040283,0,"[Document(page_content='Consistency: Messages should be delivered in the order they were sent.\nAvailability: The system should be highly available.

Capacity Estimation
Storage Estimation:
100 billion messages are shared through WhatsApp per day and each message takes 100 bytes on average
100 billion/day∗100 Bytes = 10 TB/day
For 30 days, the storage capacity would become the following:

---

Bandwidth Estimation:
According to the storage capacity estimation, our service will get 10TB of data each day, giving us a bandwidth of 926 Mb/s.
10 TB/86400sec ≈ 926Mb/s

Number of servers estimation:
WhatsApp handles around 10 million connections on a single server, which seems quite high for a server.

For 30 days, the storage capacity would become the following:

---

Functional Requirement
Conversation: The system should support one-on-one and group conversations between users.
Acknowledgment: The system should support message delivery acknowledgment, such as sent, delivered, and read.
Sharing: The system should support sharing of media files, such as images, videos, and audio.
Chat storage: The system must support the persistent storage of chat messages when a user is offline until the successful delivery of messages.
Push notifications: The system should be able to notify offline users of new messages once their status becomes online.
Non-Functional Requirement
Low latency: Users should be able to receive messages with low latency.
Consistency: Messages should be delivered in the order they were sent.

---

Bandwidth Estimation:
According to the storage capacity estimation, our service will get 10TB of data each day, giving us a bandwidth of 926 Mb/s.
10 TB/86400sec ≈ 926Mb/s

Number of servers estimation:
WhatsApp handles around 10 million connections on a single server, which seems quite high for a server.
No. of servers = Total connections per day/No. of connections per server = 2 billion/10 million = 200 servers
So, according to the above estimates, we require 200 chat servers.

The following steps describe the communication between both clients:

Now, here comes the responsibility of the group service. The group service keeps all information about users in each group in the system. It has all the information about each group, including user IDs, group ID, status, group icon, number of users, and so on. This service resides on top of the MySQL database cluster, with multiple secondary replicas distributed geographically. A Redis cache server also exists to cache data from the MySQL servers. Both geographically distributed replicas and Redis cache aid in reducing latency.

The group message handler communicates with the group service to retrieve data of Group/A users. In the last step, the group message handler follows the same process as a WebSocket server and delivers the message to each user.

---

4. Support for Group messages
Since user A is connected to a WebSocket server, it sends a message to the message service intended for Group A.The message service sends the message to Kafka with other specific information about the group. The message is saved there for further processing. In Kafka terminology, a group can be a topic, and the senders and receivers can be producers and consumers, respectively.

The following steps describe the communication between both clients:

User A and user B create a communication channel with the chat server.
User A sends a message to the chat server.
Upon receiving the message, the chat server acknowledges back to user A.
The chat server sends the message to user B and stores the message in the database if the receiver’s status is offline.
User B sends an acknowledgment to the chat server.
The chat server notifies user A that the message has been successfully delivered.
When user B reads the message, the application notifies the chat server.
The chat server notifies user A that user B has read the message.

The media file is compressed and encrypted on the device side.
The compressed and encrypted file is sent to the asset service to store the file on blob storage.
The asset service assigns an ID that’s communicated with the sender. The asset service also maintains a hash for each file to avoid duplication of content on the blob storage.
For example, if a user wants to upload an image that’s already there in the blob storage, the image won’t be uploaded. Instead, the same ID is forwarded to the receiver.
The asset service sends the ID of media files to the receiver via the message service. The receiver downloads the media file from the blob storage using the ID.
The content is loaded onto a CDN if the asset service receives a large number of requests for some particular content.

---

This API is used to send a text message from a sender to a receiver by making a POST API call to the /messages API endpoint. Generally, the sender’s and receiver’s IDs are their phone numbers.

Get Message
getMessage(user_Id)

Using this API call, users can fetch all unread messages when they come online after being offline for some time.

Upload File
uploadFile(file_type, file)

Capacity Estimation
Storage Estimation:
100 billion messages are shared through WhatsApp per day and each message takes 100 bytes on average
100 billion/day∗100 Bytes = 10 TB/day
For 30 days, the storage capacity would become the following:

---

Bandwidth Estimation:
According to the storage capacity estimation, our service will get 10TB of data each day, giving us a bandwidth of 926 Mb/s.
10 TB/86400sec ≈ 926Mb/s

Number of servers estimation:
WhatsApp handles around 10 million connections on a single server, which seems quite high for a server.
No. of servers = Total connections per day/No. of connections per server = 2 billion/10 million = 200 servers
So, according to the above estimates, we require 200 chat servers.

Requirements
The WhatsApp messenger design should meet below requirements:

---

Functional Requirement
Conversation: The system should support one-on-one and group conversations between users.
Acknowledgment: The system should support message delivery acknowledgment, such as sent, delivered, and read.
Sharing: The system should support sharing of media files, such as images, videos, and audio.
Chat storage: The system must support the persistent storage of chat messages when a user is offline until the successful delivery of messages.
Push notifications: The system should be able to notify offline users of new messages once their status becomes online.
Non-Functional Requirement
Low latency: Users should be able to receive messages with low latency.
Consistency: Messages should be delivered in the order they were sent.

Now, here comes the responsibility of the group service. The group service keeps all information about users in each group in the system. It has all the information about each group, including user IDs, group ID, status, group icon, number of users, and so on. This service resides on top of the MySQL database cluster, with multiple secondary replicas distributed geographically. A Redis cache server also exists to cache data from the MySQL servers. Both geographically distributed replicas and Redis cache aid in reducing latency.

The group message handler communicates with the group service to retrieve data of Group/A users. In the last step, the group message handler follows the same process as a WebSocket server and delivers the message to each user.

4. Support for Group messages
Since user A is connected to a WebSocket server, it sends a message to the message service intended for Group A.The message service sends the message to Kafka with other specific information about the group. The message is saved there for further processing. In Kafka terminology, a group can be a topic, and the senders and receivers can be producers and consumers, respectively.

The following steps describe the communication between both clients:

User A and user B create a communication channel with the chat server.
User A sends a message to the chat server.
Upon receiving the message, the chat server acknowledges back to user A.
The chat server sends the message to user B and stores the message in the database if the receiver’s status is offline.
User B sends an acknowledgment to the chat server.
The chat server notifies user A that the message has been successfully delivered.
When user B reads the message, the application notifies the chat server.
The chat server notifies user A that user B has read the message.

Capacity Estimation
Storage Estimation:
100 billion messages are shared through WhatsApp per day and each message takes 100 bytes on average
100 billion/day∗100 Bytes = 10 TB/day
For 30 days, the storage capacity would become the following:

---

Bandwidth Estimation:
According to the storage capacity estimation, our service will get 10TB of data each day, giving us a bandwidth of 926 Mb/s.
10 TB/86400sec ≈ 926Mb/s

Number of servers estimation:
WhatsApp handles around 10 million connections on a single server, which seems quite high for a server.
No. of servers = Total connections per day/No. of connections per server = 2 billion/10 million = 200 servers
So, according to the above estimates, we require 200 chat servers.

Requirements
The WhatsApp messenger design should meet below requirements:

---

Functional Requirement
Conversation: The system should support one-on-one and group conversations between users.
Acknowledgment: The system should support message delivery acknowledgment, such as sent, delivered, and read.
Sharing: The system should support sharing of media files, such as images, videos, and audio.
Chat storage: The system must support the persistent storage of chat messages when a user is offline until the successful delivery of messages.
Push notifications: The system should be able to notify offline users of new messages once their status becomes online.
Non-Functional Requirement
Low latency: Users should be able to receive messages with low latency.
Consistency: Messages should be delivered in the order they were sent.

Now, here comes the responsibility of the group service. The group service keeps all information about users in each group in the system. It has all the information about each group, including user IDs, group ID, status, group icon, number of users, and so on. This service resides on top of the MySQL database cluster, with multiple secondary replicas distributed geographically. A Redis cache server also exists to cache data from the MySQL servers. Both geographically distributed replicas and Redis cache aid in reducing latency.

The group message handler communicates with the group service to retrieve data of Group/A users. In the last step, the group message handler follows the same process as a WebSocket server and delivers the message to each user.

4. Support for Group messages
Since user A is connected to a WebSocket server, it sends a message to the message service intended for Group A.The message service sends the message to Kafka with other specific information about the group. The message is saved there for further processing. In Kafka terminology, a group can be a topic, and the senders and receivers can be producers and consumers, respectively.

The following steps describe the communication between both clients:

User A and user B create a communication channel with the chat server.
User A sends a message to the chat server.
Upon receiving the message, the chat server acknowledges back to user A.
The chat server sends the message to user B and stores the message in the database if the receiver’s status is offline.
User B sends an acknowledgment to the chat server.
The chat server notifies user A that the message has been successfully delivered.
When user B reads the message, the application notifies the chat server.
The chat server notifies user A that user B has read the message.

The responsibility of each of these servers is to provide a port to every online user. The mapping between servers, ports, and users is stored in the WebSocket manager that resides on top of a cluster of the data store. In this case, that’s Redis.

2. Send or receive messages
The WebSocket manager is responsible for maintaining a mapping between an active user and a port assigned to the user. Whenever a user is connected to another WebSocket server, this information will be updated in the data store. A WebSocket server also communicates with another service called message service.

Since one server isn’t enough to handle billions of devices, there should be enough servers to handle billions of users.",134.38391876220703," The provided text does not specifically address whether compression techniques will be used for storing the WhatsApp system's data. However, it is common practice in distributed systems like this one to employ various optimization methods that could include data compression within databases or caches such as Redis.

For a service designed with scalability and performance at its core—like what you are designing here for handling billions of users and messages on WhatsApp Messenger—it is reasonable to assume several strategies will be employed:

- **Data Storage**: The MySQL database cluster, likely hosting the primary data store due to relational integrity needs, may not necessarily compress its own storage but might utilize specialized hardware like SSDs or ongoing optimization techniques. In such high traffic systems, compression can lead to performance degradation for write operations if done in-memory without proper indexing and query planning because of the additional CPU overhead associated with encoding/decoding data before writing it to disk (and vice versa).

- **Redis Cache**: As a cache server used here presumably for session state or temporary message storage, Redis may employ compression strategies like LZF which compresses binary objects without significant computational cost. This allows saving on memory and potentially reduces I/O if using disk backends that can leverage in-memory data with some form of snapshotted persistence (like RDB or AOF snapshotting) to maintain durability even when compression is used for performance gains during active operation periods, all while balancing tradeoffs between latency and throughput.

Requirements
The WhatsApp messenger design should meet below requirements:

---

Functional Requirement
Conversation: The system should support one-on-one and group conversations between users.
Acknowledgment: The system should support message delivery acknowledgment, such as sent, delivered, and read.
Sharing: The system should support sharing of media files, such as images, videos, and audio.
Chat storage: The system must support the persistent storage of chat messages when a user is offline until the successful delivery of messages.
Push notifications: The system should be able to notify offline users of new messages once their status becomes online.
Non-Functional Requirement
Low latency: Users should be able to receive messages with low latency.
Consistency: Messages should be delivered in the order they were sent.

---

Now, here comes the responsibility of the group service. The group service keeps all information about users in each group in the system. It has all the information about each group, including user IDs, group ID, status, group icon, number of users, and so on. This service resides on top of the MySQL database cluster, with multiple secondary replicas distributed geographically. A Redis cache server also exists to cache data from the MySQL servers. Both geographically distributed replicas and Redis cache aid in reducing latency.

The group message handler communicates with the group service to retrieve data of Group/A users. In the last step, the group message handler follows the same process as a WebSocket server and delivers the message to each user.

---

4. Support for Group messages
Since user A is connected to a WebSocket server, it sends a message to the message service intended for Group A.The message service sends the message to Kafka with other specific information about the group. The message is saved there for further processing. In Kafka terminology, a group can be a topic, and the senders and receivers can be producers and consumers, respectively.

---

API Design
Send message
sendMessage(message_ID, sender_ID, reciever_ID, type, text=none, media_object=none, document=none)

---

The following steps describe the communication between both clients:

User A and user B create a communication channel with the chat server.
User A sends a message to the chat server.
Upon receiving the message, the chat server acknowledges back to user A.
The chat server sends the message to user B and stores the message in the database if the receiver’s status is offline.
User B sends an acknowledgment to the chat server.
The chat server notifies user A that the message has been successfully delivered.
When user B reads the message, the application notifies the chat server.
The chat server notifies user A that user B has read the message.

The responsibility of each of these servers is to provide a port to every online user. The mapping between servers, ports, and users is stored in the WebSocket manager that resides on top of a cluster of the data store. In this case, that’s Redis.

2. Send or receive messages
The WebSocket manager is responsible for maintaining a mapping between an active user and a port assigned to the user. Whenever a user is connected to another WebSocket server, this information will be updated in the data store. A WebSocket server also communicates with another service called message service.

Architecture
We will be using microservices architecture since it will make it easier to horizontally scale and decouple our services. Each service will have ownership of its own data model.

1. Connection with Websocket Server
In WhatsApp, each active device is connected with a WebSocket server via WebSocket protocol. A WebSocket server keeps the connection open with all the active (online) users. Since one server isn’t enough to handle billions of devices, there should be enough servers to handle billions of users.

For 30 days, the storage capacity would become the following:
30∗10 TB/day = 300 TB/month

---

The media file is compressed and encrypted on the device side.
The compressed and encrypted file is sent to the asset service to store the file on blob storage.
The asset service assigns an ID that’s communicated with the sender. The asset service also maintains a hash for each file to avoid duplication of content on the blob storage.
For example, if a user wants to upload an image that’s already there in the blob storage, the image won’t be uploaded. Instead, the same ID is forwarded to the receiver.
The asset service sends the ID of media files to the receiver via the message service. The receiver downloads the media file from the blob storage using the ID.
The content is loaded onto a CDN if the asset service receives a large number of requests for some particular content.",150.4214310646057," No, in your provided document and description regarding WhatsApp's system design, it mentions that ""the compressed file is sent to the asset service"" but does not specify whether encryption occurs immediately on compression or if both processes happen sequentially (compression followed by encryption). Typically, for security reasons like this sensitive information handling protocol might encrypt data before compressing. However, without explicit confirmation in your document that only necessary encrypted content goes through the process and other unrelated compressed files are sent as-is to blob storage or even not mentioned at all (since it's optional), I can't conclusively say encryption happens exclusively for ""necessary"" data based on this information alone.

For WhatsApp, they have implemented end-to-end encryption ensuring that only the sender and receiver are able to read messages after a secure handshake process using their proprietary protocols (like WTLS - What's New Protocol) which involves public key pinning for device authentication. This is not described in your document but provides insight into WhatsApp’s approach towards encrypting data relevant only between users, without the need to specify ""necessary"" or any other criteria explicitly as each message exchange ensures security by design through encryption and decryption on both ends using symmetric keys derived from their end-to-end encrypted channel.

Therefore, in a comprehensive system like WhatsApp's that prioritizes privacy without explicit mention of encrypting only necessary data within your document’s context: 
1) Users can rest assured messages are protected throughout transit and storage as long as they follow the standard procedure for message exchange.
2) Asset services manage media files, ensuring each file has a unique identifier to prevent duplication but without specific mention of encryption during transfer or while stored on blob storage systems like Amazon S3 used by WhatsApp.",42.91621541976929,0,"[Document(page_content='Consistency: Messages should be delivered in the order they were sent.\nAvailability: The system should be highly available.

Capacity Estimation
Storage Estimation:
100 billion messages are shared through WhatsApp per day and each message takes 100 bytes on average
100 billion/day∗100 Bytes = 10 TB/day
For 30 days, the storage capacity would become the following:

---

Bandwidth Estimation:
According to the storage capacity estimation, our service will get 10TB of data each day, giving us a bandwidth of 926 Mb/s.
10 TB/86400sec ≈ 926Mb/s

Number of servers estimation:
WhatsApp handles around 10 million connections on a single server, which seems quite high for a server.
No. of servers = Total connections per day/No. of connections per server = 2 billion/10 million = 200 servers
So, according to the above estimates, we require 200 chat servers.

1. Connection with Websocket Server
In WhatsApp, each active device is connected with a WebSocket server via WebSocket protocol. A WebSocket server keeps the connection open with all the active (online) users. Since one server isn’t enough to handle billions of devices, there should be enough servers to handle billions of users.",117.74789476394652," Based on your description and requirements for WhatsApp's system design that involves a microservices architecture with WebSocket communication between clients (users) and services like message service, file downloader etc., here is an outline addressing whether or not TLS termination would be mentioned:

The provided document does not explicitly mention the handling of SSL/TLS at any point. However, it's standard practice to terminate TLS on a border gateway that connects client networks (like mobile devices and computers) with services through secure transport protocols like HTTPS or WebSocket over WSS (WebSocket Secure). In this design context for WhatsApp:

- **Client Connections**: When clients establish connections, it would be standard to terminate TLS at the border gateway. This means that once users connect via a web client using HTTPS and attempt a secure WebSocket connection over WSS, SSL/TLS encryption will typically happen on the initial handshake between their browser (or app) and your servers before proceeding with an unencrypted WebSocket protocol internally for data transmission within this secured channel.
  
- **Interservice Communication**: Within each service's architecture – message handling, group management, etc., TLS could be terminated after initial authentication or handshake at a secure gateway which then passes the session keys and related encrypted information between services in unencrypted WebSocket communication (WSS). This reduces overhead but introduces risk if sensitive data is transmitted.
  
- **Redis Cache**: Since Redis serves as an intermediary caching layer, it would likely operate over plain TCP/IP without TLS termination unless specifically encrypting cached messages before storage or during retrieval processes to protect user information privacy and comply with regulations like GDPR.
  
- **Group Messaging**: When a message is sent from one group member (user A) via the chat server, it's transmitted over WSS within that session as well. Any sensitive data in messages would ideally be encrypted end to end before sending and decrypted only at user B’s device after reception unless TLS termination takes place immediately upon receiving these secured packets on a gateway or an unsecured service layer due to specific architectural choices, which is not recommended for protecting the privacy of sensitive data like conversations.
  
- **WebSocket Manager**: The WebSocket manager that handles mapping between users and server ports does so through its internal communications with services within WhatsApp's architecture; thus it would likely terminate TLS after any initial handshake, especially if dealing internally in plain text for session management without exposing sensitive data.
  
- **File Download Service**: Similar to the chat service above when downloading media files via file downloader API `downloadFile(user_id, file_id)`, this would also likely operate over a terminated TLS connection at its gateway before proceeding with potentially unsecured internal protocols for actual file transfers.
  
It's crucial that all data transmissions are handled following best practices regarding user privacy and security regulations like GDPR, HIPAA (for health-related messages), etc., which often necessitate encryption not just at the perimeter but throughout various layers of an application stack where sensitive information is processed.

Remember to always refer back to WhatsApp'in’s own implementation details or consult with their security team for accurate and specific architectural decisions they have made regarding TLS termination in all aspects of data transmission within your service design, especially concerning the handling of private conversations and media sharing that could be classified as sensitive information.",72.72890162467957,0,"[Document(page_content='Consistency: Messages should be delivered in the order they were sent.\nAvailability: The system should be highly available.

- **WebSocket Manager**: The WebSocket manager that handles mapping between users and server ports does so through its internal communications with services within WhatsApp's architecture; thus it would likely terminate TLS after any initial handshake, especially if dealing internally in plain text for session management without exposing sensitive data.
  
- **File Download Service**: Similar to the chat service above when downloading media files via file downloader API `downloadFile(user_id, file_id)`, this would also likely operate over a terminated TLS connection at its gateway before proceeding with potentially unsecured internal protocols for actual file transfers.
  
It's crucial that all data transmissions are handled following best practices regarding user privacy and security regulations like GDPR, HIPAA (for health-related messages), etc., which often necessitate encryption not just at the perimeter but throughout various layers of an application stack where sensitive information is processed.

Remember to always refer back to WhatsApp'in’s own implementation details or consult with their security team for accurate and specific architectural decisions they have made regarding TLS termination in all aspects of data transmission within your service design, especially concerning the handling of private conversations and media sharing that could be classified as sensitive information.",No,No
Is there any mention of using a service mesh only if needed ?,"Consistency: Messages should be delivered in the order they were sent.
Availability: The system should be highly available. However, the availability can be compromised in the interest of consistency.
Security: The system must be secure via end-to-end encryption. The end-to-end encryption ensures that only the two communicating parties can see the content of messages. Nobody in between, not even WhatsApp, should have access.
Scalability: The system should be highly scalable to support an ever-increasing number of users and messages per day.
Capacity Estimation
Storage Estimation:
100 billion messages are shared through WhatsApp per day and each message takes 100 bytes on average
100 billion/day∗100 Bytes = 10 TB/day
For 30 days, the storage capacity would become the following:

---

Bandwidth Estimation:
According to the storage capacity estimation, our service will get 10TB of data each day, giving us a bandwidth of 926 Mb/s.
10 TB/86400sec ≈ 926Mb/s

Number of servers estimation:
WhatsApp handles around 10 million connections on a single server, which seems quite high for a server.
No. of servers = Total connections per day/No. of connections per server = 2 billion/10 million = 200 servers
So, according to the above estimates, we require 200 chat servers.

Approach to achieve the below system attributes
Requirements
The WhatsApp messenger design should meet below requirements:

---

Functional Requirement
Conversation: The system should support one-on-one and group conversations between users.
Acknowledgment: The system should support message delivery acknowledgment, such as sent, delivered, and read.
Sharing: The system should support sharing of media files, such as images, videos, and audio.
Chat storage: The system must support the persistent storage of chat messages when a user is offline until the successful delivery of messages.
Push notifications: The system should be able to notify offline users of new messages once their status becomes online.
Non-Functional Requirement
Low latency: Users should be able to receive messages with low latency.
Consistency: Messages should be delivered in the order they were sent.

---

Now, here comes the responsibility of the group service. The group service keeps all information about users in each group in the system. It has all the information about each group, including user IDs, group ID, status, group icon, number of users, and so on. This service resides on top of the MySQL database cluster, with multiple secondary replicas distributed geographically. A Redis cache server also exists to cache data from the MySQL servers. Both geographically distributed replicas and Redis cache aid in reducing latency.

The group message handler communicates with the group service to retrieve data of Group/A users. In the last step, the group message handler follows the same process as a WebSocket server and delivers the message to each user.

---

4. Support for Group messages
Since user A is connected to a WebSocket server, it sends a message to the message service intended for Group A.The message service sends the message to Kafka with other specific information about the group. The message is saved there for further processing. In Kafka terminology, a group can be a topic, and the senders and receivers can be producers and consumers, respectively.

API Design
Send message
sendMessage(message_ID, sender_ID, reciever_ID, type, text=none, media_object=none, document=none)

The following steps describe the communication between both clients:

User A and user B create a communication channel with the chat server.
User A sends a message to the chat server.
Upon receiving the message, the chat server acknowledges back to user A.
The chat server sends the message to user B and stores the message in the database if the receiver’s status is offline.
User B sends an acknowledgment to the chat server.
The chat server notifies user A that the message has been successfully delivered.
When user B reads the message, the application notifies the chat server.
The chat server notifies user A that user B has read the message.
Data Model Design:
Data-Model-Design

---

The responsibility of each of these servers is to provide a port to every online user. The mapping between servers, ports, and users is stored in the WebSocket manager that resides on top of a cluster of the data store. In this case, that’s Redis.

2. Send or receive messages
The WebSocket manager is responsible for maintaining a mapping between an active user and a port assigned to the user. Whenever a user is connected to another WebSocket server, this information will be updated in the data store. A WebSocket server also communicates with another service called message service.

Low-Level-Design(LLD)-of-WhatsApp-Messenger

1. Connection with Websocket Server
In WhatsApp, each active device is connected with a WebSocket server via WebSocket protocol. A WebSocket server keeps the connection open with all the active (online) users. Since one server isn’t enough to handle billions of devices, there should be enough servers to handle billions of users.

For 30 days, the storage capacity would become the following:
30∗10 TB/day = 300 TB/month",162.0820927619934," The provided document does not specifically discuss or require using a service mesh for WhatsApp Messenger. Instead, the architecture is based on microservices with separate services handling different aspects like user authentication (OAuth), chat functionality including one-on-one and group conversations, media sharing capabilities, push notifications, message delivery acknowledgment system, low latency communication through Kafka and Redis cache for efficient data retrieval.

The document details the functional requirements of WhatsApp messenger in terms of conversation support, user identification with OAuth mechanism via Google or Facebook account linking (optional), shared media files functionality including images, audio, video sharing capabilities along with acknowledgment system that informs users about their message's delivery status - sent/delivered and read. It also addresses the need for low latency messaging service using Kafka alongside Redis cache to minimize data replication overhead from MySQL database cluster which is geographically distributed in multiple secondary replicas, further aiding lowering system response time during peak usage periods like New Year or Christmas celebrations when user activity surges.

The document also details the non-functional requirement of message consistency and delivery order maintenance to ensure messages are delivered accurately reflective of their original sequence as per sender's intentions without data loss, ensnering system stability during peak traffic times. The WhatsApp Messenger employs this approach alongside websocket protocol for realtime communication while providing offline message storage until the receiver goes online to retrieve messages from server end which in turn notifies user of new incoming messages through push notifications mechanism when they are back online, thus enhancing system responsiveness and continuity.

Finally, it describes how a group service holds information about users within each WhatsApp Group with their IDs, status (online/offline), number of members in the chat etc., while leveraging multiple geographically distributed MySQL database clusters along with Redis cache server for efficient data retrieval and management. 

The API design section details how to send messages through WebSocket connection by providing required fields such as message_ID, sender_id/reciever_id (depending if it is one-on-one or group conversation), type of the sent message along with optional media file attachment or document sharing. It further explains that on receipt and acknowledgment from recieving end to delivery status backed by notification system for successful deliveries, reads etc., thus ensuring transparency in messaging activity between users within an application ecosystem.

In terms of data model design details are not explicitly provided but the document suggests a robust handling mechanism involving user-device connection mapping with websocket server and message service communications to ensure smooth flow of one-on-one or group conversations via Kafka topic, acknowledgment system along with push notifications for offline users.

In terms of technical architecture details such as load balancing across the cluster servers are not explicitly mentioned but it is implied through mentions of geographically distributed MySQL database clusters and Redis cache server usage to minimize latency during peak traffic times thereby ensuring optimal performance under varying system loads, which in turn can help handle additional service requests if needed.",66.08892059326172,0,"[Document(page_content='Consistency: Messages should be delivered in the order they were sent.\nAvailability: The system should be highly available.

Is there any mention of optimizing the size of AI/ML models?,"Bandwidth Estimation:
According to the storage capacity estimation, our service will get 10TB of data each day, giving us a bandwidth of 926 Mb/s.
10 TB/86400sec ≈ 926Mb/s

Number of servers estimation:
WhatsApp handles around 10 million connections on a single server, which seems quite high for a server.
No. of servers = Total connections per day/No. of connections per server = 2 billion/10 million = 200 servers
So, according to the above estimates, we require 200 chat servers.

High Level Design (HLD) of WhatsApp Messenger
High-Level-Design-(HLD)-of-WhatsApp-Messenger

The following steps describe the communication between both clients:

---

The responsibility of each of these servers is to provide a port to every online user. The mapping between servers, ports, and users is stored in the WebSocket manager that resides on top of a cluster of the data store. In this case, that’s Redis.

2. Send or receive messages
The WebSocket manager is responsible for maintaining a mapping between an active user and a port assigned to the user. Whenever a user is connected to another WebSocket server, this information will be updated in the data store. A WebSocket server also communicates with another service called message service.

Data Model Design:

Low Level Design (LLD) of System Design
Approach to achieve the below system attributes
Requirements
The WhatsApp messenger design should meet below requirements:

---

Functional Requirement
Conversation: The system should support one-on-one and group conversations between users.
Acknowledgment: The system should support message delivery acknowledgment, such as sent, delivered, and read.
Sharing: The system should support sharing of media files, such as images, videos, and audio.
Chat storage: The system must support the persistent storage of chat messages when a user is offline until the successful delivery of messages.
Push notifications: The system should be able to notify offline users of new messages once their status becomes online.
Non-Functional Requirement
Low latency: Users should be able to receive messages with low latency.
Consistency: Messages should be delivered in the order they were sent.

---

Now, here comes the responsibility of the group service. The group service keeps all information about users in each group in the system. It has all the information about each group, including user IDs, group ID, status, group icon, number of users, and so on. This service resides on top of the MySQL database cluster, with multiple secondary replicas distributed geographically. A Redis cache server also exists to cache data from the MySQL servers. Both geographically distributed replicas and Redis cache aid in reducing latency.

The group message handler communicates with the group service to retrieve data of Group/A users. In the last step, the group message handler follows the same process as a WebSocket server and delivers the message to each user.

---

4. Support for Group messages
Since user A is connected to a WebSocket server, it sends a message to the message service intended for Group A.The message service sends the message to Kafka with other specific information about the group. The message is saved there for further processing. In Kafka terminology, a group can be a topic, and the senders and receivers can be producers and consumers, respectively.

---

API Design
Send message
sendMessage(message_ID, sender_ID, reciever_ID, type, text=none, media_object=none, document=none)

---

The following steps describe the communication between both clients:

User A and user B create a communication channel with the chat server.
User A sends a message to the chat server.
Upon receiving the message, the chat server acknowledges back to user A.
The chat server sends the message to user B and stores the message in the database if the receiver’s status is offline.
User B sends an acknowledgment to the chat server.
The chat server notifies user A that the message has been successfully delivered.
When user B reads the message, the application notifies the chat server.
The chat server notifies user A that user B has read the message.

In WhatsApp, each active device is connected with a WebSocket server via WebSocket protocol. A WebSocket server keeps the connection open with all the active (online) users. Since one server isn’t enough to handle billions of devices, there should be enough servers to handle billions of users.

Consistency: Messages should be delivered in the order they were sent.
Availability: The system should be highly available. However, the availability can be compromised in the interest of consistency.
Security: The system must be secure via end-to-end encryption. The end-to-end encryption ensures that only the two communicating parties can see the content of messages. Nobody in between, not even WhatsApp, should have access.
Scalability: The system should be highly scalable to support an ever-increasing number of users and messages per day.

Capacity Estimation
Storage Estimation:
100 billion messages are shared through WhatsApp per day and each message takes 100 bytes on average
100 billion/day∗100 Bytes = 10 TB/day
For 30 days, the storage capacity would become the following:

---

Bandwidth Estimation:
According to the storage capacity estimation, our service will get 10TB of data each day, giving us a bandwidth of 926 Mb/s.
10 TB/86400sec ≈ 926Mb/s

Number of servers estimation:
WhatsApp handles around 10 million connections on a single server, which seems quite high for a server.
No. of servers = Total connections per day/No. of connections per server = 2 billion/10 million = 200 servers
So, according to the above estimates, we require 200 chat servers.

Requirements
The WhatsApp messenger design should meet below requirements:

---

Functional Requirement
Conversation: The system should support one-on-one and group conversations between users.
Acknowledgment: The system should support message delivery acknowledgment, such as sent, delivered, and read.
Sharing: The system should support sharing of media files, such as images, videos, and audio.
Chat storage: The system must support the persistent storage of chat messages when a user is offline until the successful delivery of messages.
Push notifications: The system should be able to notify offline users of new messages once their status becomes online.
Non-Functional Requirement
Low latency: Users should be able to receive messages with low latency.
Consistency: Messages should be delivered in the order they were sent.

---

Now, here comes the responsibility of the group service. The group service keeps all information about users in each group in the system. It has all the information about each group, including user IDs, group ID, status, group icon, number of users, and so on. This service resides on top of the MySQL database cluster, with multiple secondary replicas distributed geographically. A Redis cache server also exists to cache data from the MySQL servers. Both geographically distributed replicas and Redis cache aid in reducing latency.

The group message handler communicates with the group service to retrieve data of Group/A users. In the last step, the group message handler follows the same process as a WebSocket server and delivers the message to each user.

---

4. Support for Group messages
Since user A is connected to a WebSocket server, it sends a message to the message service intended for Group A.The message service sends the message to Kafka with other specific information about the group. The message is saved there for further processing. In Kafka terminology, a group can be a topic, and the senders and receivers can be producers and consumers, respectively.

The following steps describe the communication between both clients:

User A and user B create a communication channel with the chat server.
User A sends a message to the chat server.
Upon receiving the message, the chat server acknowledges back to user A.
The chat server sends the message to user B and stores the message in the database if the receiver’s status is offline.
User B sends an acknowledgment to the chat server.
The chat server notifies user A that the message has been successfully delivered.
When user B reads the message, the application notifies the chat server.
The chat server notifies user A that user B has read the message.

1. Connection with Websocket Server
In WhatsApp, each active device is connected with a WebSocket server via WebSocket protocol. A WebSocket server keeps the connection open with all the active (online) users. Since one server isn’t enough to handle billions of devices, there should be enough servers to handle billions of users.

---

The responsibility of each of these servers is to provide a port to every online user. The mapping between servers, ports, and users is stored in the WebSocket manager that resides on top of a cluster of the data store. In this case, that’s Redis.

2. Send or receive messages
The WebSocket manager is responsible for maintaining a mapping between an active user and a port assigned to the user. Whenever a user is connected to another WebSocket server, this information will be updated in the data store. A WebSocket server also communicates with another service called message service.

For 30 days, the storage capacity would become the following:
30∗10 TB/day = 300 TB/month",132.80171966552734," The provided WhatsApp messenger system design document does not explicitly mention the use of specific data storage solutions such as Parquet, Avro, ORC, etc. However, it is implied that performance optimization and low latency are essential aspects due to requirements for acknowledgment mechanisms (sent/delivered), consistency in message delivery order, group messaging capabilities with geographically distributed replicas of the MySQL database cluster as well as Redis cache usage. These hints at a requirement for an efficient data handling system capable of dealing with large volumes and providing quick access to frequently read or updated records (like active/inactive user statuses).

Given this context, while not directly mentioned in your document excerpt here are the reasons that might lead you towards considering Parquet-based file formats:

1. **Columnar Storage** - Since WhatsApp heavily relies on text messages and acknowledgments which likely involve numerous user actions per day/minute (sending, reading), a columnar storage format like Parquet could be beneficial for optimizing read operations by loading only necessary columns of data into memory at any given time.
   
2. **Efficiency in IO** - For the low latency requirement and high throughput demands on group messaging services with potentially large chunks of user activity, reducing I/O wait times is crucial. Parquet files are compressed by default which can decrease disk storage costs while keeping access fast due to their efficient encoding schemes.
   
3. **Support for Complex Queries** - As the system scales and more complex queries or aggregations become necessary (for example, leaderboards based on activity within groups), columnar formats like Parquet would enable such computations with less I/O overhead compared to row-based storage systems due to their ability to skip unnecessary data.
   
4. **Integration** - The system design document mentions the use of a MySQL database cluster and Redis cache, which are not designed for processing large files or handling massive amounts of unstructured text efficiently by default. Integrating Parquet-formatted storage could be considered if there's a need to store derived datasets that might benefit from such an approach (e.g., user activity logs).
   
5. **Scalability** - As the system grows, and especially considering replication across geographically distributed databases for low latency access, Parquet can aid in efficient scaling due to its compact representation when dealing with large datasets that are often encountered by social media applications like WhatsApp Messenger services.

To implement a design using these features effectively would mean modifying the system's data models and service interactions around storage systems known for high performance on such tasks, possibly integrating Parquet formats into your MySQL database or as an additional layer of file-based caching/storage alongside Redis if appropriate in terms of consistency guarantees.

In summary, while not mentioned explicitly in the document you provided, a modern messaging service with WhatsApp's level of user activity and interaction patterns might find significant benefits from incorporating efficient data formats like Parquet for certain use cases to improve performance under high load conditions.",64.54114246368408,0,"[Document(page_content='Consistency: Messages should be delivered in the order they were sent.\nAvailability: The system should be highly available.

These hints at a requirement for an efficient data handling system capable of dealing with large volumes and providing quick access to frequently read or updated records (like active/inactive user statuses).

Given this context, while not directly mentioned in your document excerpt here are the reasons that might lead you towards considering Parquet-based file formats:

1. **Columnar Storage** - Since WhatsApp heavily relies on text messages and acknowledgments which likely involve numerous user actions per day/minute (sending, reading), a columnar storage format like Parquet could be beneficial for optimizing read operations by loading only necessary columns of data into memory at any given time.
   
2. **Efficiency in IO** - For the low latency requirement and high throughput demands on group messaging services with potentially large chunks of user activity, reducing I/O wait times is crucial. Parquet files are compressed by default which can decrease disk storage costs while keeping access fast due to their efficient encoding schemes.
   
3. **Support for Complex Queries** - As the system scales and more complex queries or aggregations become necessary (for example, leaderboards based on activity within groups), columnar formats like Parquet would enable such computations with less I/O overhead compared to row-based storage systems due to their ability to skip unnecessary data.
   
4. **Integration** - The system design document mentions the use of a MySQL database cluster and Redis cache, which are not designed for processing large files or handling massive amounts of unstructured text efficiently by default. Integrating Parquet-formatted storage could be considered if there's a need to store derived datasets that might benefit from such an approach (e.g., user activity logs).
   
5. **Scalability** - As the system grows, and especially considering replication across geographically distributed databases for low latency access, Parquet can aid in efficient scaling due to its compact representation when dealing with large datasets that are often encountered by social media applications like WhatsApp Messenger services.

To implement a design using these features effectively would mean modifying the system's data models and service interactions around storage systems known for high performance on such tasks, possibly integrating Parquet formats into your MySQL database or as an additional layer of file-based caching/storage alongside Redis if appropriate in terms of consistency guarantees.

In summary, while not mentioned explicitly in the document you provided, a modern messaging service with WhatsApp's level of user activity and interaction patterns might find significant benefits from incorporating efficient data formats like Parquet for certain use cases to improve performance under high load conditions.",No,No
"Is there any mention of selecting a more energy-efficient AI/ML framework, such as those built on programming languages like C/C++?","Consistency: Messages should be delivered in the order they were sent.
Availability: The system should be highly available. However, the availability can be compromised in the interest of consistency.
Security: The system must be secure via end-to-end encryption. The end-to-end encryption ensures that only the two communicating parties can see the content of messages. Nobody in between, not even WhatsApp, should have access.
Scalability: The system should be highly scalable to support an ever-increasing number of users and messages per day.
Capacity Estimation
Storage Estimation:
100 billion messages are shared through WhatsApp per day and each message takes 100 bytes on average
100 billion/day∗100 Bytes = 10 TB/day
For 30 days, the storage capacity would become the following:

---

Bandwidth Estimation:
According to the storage capacity estimation, our service will get 10TB of data each day, giving us a bandwidth of 926 Mb/s.
10 TB/86400sec ≈ 926Mb/s

Number of servers estimation:
WhatsApp handles around 10 million connections on a single server, which seems quite high for a server.
No. of servers = Total connections per day/No. of connections per server = 2 billion/10 million = 200 servers
So, according to the above estimates, we require 200 chat servers.

In WhatsApp, each active device is connected with a WebSocket server via WebSocket protocol. A WebSocket server keeps the connection open with all the active (online) users. Since one server isn’t enough to handle billions of devices, there should be enough servers to handle billions of users.

---

The responsibility of each of these servers is to provide a port to every online user. The mapping between servers, ports, and users is stored in the WebSocket manager that resides on top of a cluster of the data store. In this case, that’s Redis.

2. Send or receive messages
The WebSocket manager is responsible for maintaining a mapping between an active user and a port assigned to the user. Whenever a user is connected to another WebSocket server, this information will be updated in the data store. A WebSocket server also communicates with another service called message service.

For 30 days, the storage capacity would become the following:
30∗10 TB/day = 300 TB/month",139.6717872619629," The given document does not explicitly discuss choosing specific hardware configurations (e.g., CPU, memory) for running instances in a Kubernetes cluster on Google Cloud Platform GCP. Similarly, it doesn't detail which Virtual Machine (VM) Instance Types to use when utilizing Compute Engine services from GCP or any other cloud provider like AWS EC2.

For such decisions regarding hardware and VM instance types for an application like a WhatsApp-like messenger service on Google Cloud Platform, you would typically consider factors like the expected load (number of concurrent users/connections), required performance levels in terms of response times or latency thresholds set by functional requirements.

Since I didn't find any specific recommendations about hardware selection within your provided document related to WhatsApp messenger system design, here are some general guidelines you can follow: 

- **Performance Needs and Cost**: Start with a basic instance type that meets the minimum performance needs for handling user connections (WebSocket) along with message storage. Then iteratively upgrade your resources if needed based on load testing results while also considering cost efficiency to prevent unnecessary spending. Tools like Cloud Load Balancer or Amazon Elastic Load Balancer can be used alongside Kubernetes' Ingress Controller and Service Mesh technologies for handling traffic distribution efficiently across multiple instances, ensuring that the system scales horizontally when needed.
- **Instance Types**: Google provides a wide range of instance types from their Compute Engine with different memory (RAM), CPU options suitable to handle varying loads which you can choose based on your expected workload and budget constraints. Some popular ones for serving web applications are Standard_D12s, N1 or P3 machines that provide high network IO capabilities ideal for handling connections in a highly concurrent environment like messaging system where many users could be sending/receiving messages simultaneously
- **Machine Types**: When deploying with Google Cloud Kubernetes Engine (GKE), you should choose the right machine types as well. Machine type 'e2' is good to start with and then upgrade based on testing requirements, but also consider using autoscaler that automatically scales your pods in or out within a cluster depending upon the demand for resources during different times of day
- **GPU Resources**: If you anticipate heavy computations (like media processing), it may make sense to include GPU options like Tesla K80/P4 into your architecture. However, this is usually not needed in messaging applications unless there are some specific background tasks that require intensive computation or image and video analysis
- **Persistence**: For persistent storage of chat messages as per requirement, Google Cloud Filestore can be used where you create a file share for each group with the necessary permissions. This way when users connect/disconnect from WebSocket server they will access this shared data instead which is effectively treated like database here but offers better performance due to lower latency 
- **Replication & Backup**: Ensure replication of critical application state across multiple zones and availability domains in case a disaster occurs. You can use solutions such as Cloud SQL or GCS for managing your MySQL/PostgreSQL databases which will automatically fail over (or up) to standby nodes when the primary one fails, ensuring high-availability of service with minimal downtime
- **Monitoring & Logging**: Use Google StackDriver and its extensions like Operations suite for monitoring application performance in real time. It helps you set alerts based on predefined thresholds or anomaly detection which is critical to ensuring the system remains responsive at all times 
- **Security Considerations**: Make sure to use SSL/TLS encryption when establishing WebSocket connections between clients and server as well as encrypt sensitive data in database. Ensure proper access controls are set up for different services that have their own respective databases or other storage systems, following the principle of least privilege
- **Redis Caching**: If appropriate based on your caching requirements to reduce latency (and cost), consider using Redis Cache Cluster with multiple read replicas. This can serve as a cache for frequently accessed data from MySQL/PostgreSQL and also provide atomic operations when updating the chat status of users in real-time
- **Push Notifications**: Leverage Firebase Cloud Messaging or similar service (Google's solution is PubSub) to send push notifications about new messages whenever user becomes online. You can set up subscriptions based on specific groups/channels and notify them accordingly 
- **Data Model & API Design**: Make sure your database schema supports storing metadata related with each message, like timestamp, sender ID, receiver ID etc., which will be helpful in maintaining consistency (as per requirement). Also make the messaging service APIs RESTful or GraphQL based for easier consumption from other parts of system
- **Rate Limiting**: As a safety measure to prevent spamming/abuse and also manage cost efficiently, consider using rate limiting at API Gateway level. This helps in controlling number of messages that can be sent by users per minute or second so as not overloading the backend 
- **Test & Load Balancing**: Make sure you set up continuous load testing with tools like Gatling/JMeter to simulate heavy traffic (e.g., when multiple groups have a large amount of concurrent chats) and then make changes if needed in your infrastructure setup or scale horizontally 
- **Disaster Recovery**: For setting up the database backup strategy, consider using Cloud SQL's automatic backups which will help you restore to most recent state without affecting performance. Also ensure that data consistency is maintained during such operations by considering eventual synchronization of file shares in case your chat messages are stored as files (as per requirement) 
- **Network Latency Considerations**: Make sure the network latency between users and server does not exceed predefined thresholds. In order to maintain global availability, consider using Google Cloud CDN service for serving static assets of application so that content delivery is faster from different regions around world which will improve overall experience 
- **Multi-Region Deployment**: If necessary based on your expected user base location and reliance needs (high latency can affect the responsiveness in some cases), consider deploying messaging services across multiple zones/regions with inter-region replication for failover capabilities. This will provide users better experience by keeping their conversations close to them physically, but also ensure that service stays available even if one region fails 
- **Cross Region Replication**: As mentioned above in the case of MySQL or PostgreSQL databases use multi regional master/slave setup with synchronous replication for maintaining data consistency across different regions. It helps keep your database state consistent while providing high availability to users by routing their requests based on geographic location
- **Cost Optimization**: Make sure you monitor the costs closely and optimize it where necessary like using autoscale policies, choosing right pricing tiers for storage etc 

These are some broad guidelines that can be followed. But always consider to choose a suitable provider based on your specific requirements & budget as different cloud providers (e.g., AWS/Azure) offer similar services with their own unique features and advantages, which might prove more beneficial for you in the long run
Here is an example of how you could set up Redis cache cluster: 

- Firstly decide on your caching strategy like LRU or write through etc based upon use case. For messaging app its usually read-through pattern with user statuses as most frequently accessed data
- Create a redis Cache Cluster by creating multiple replicas in different availability zones of same region and configure them to be master/slave setup for failover capabilities 
- Setup your Redis instance so that whenever any message is sent or received, it's also stored (with relevant metadata) into MySQL/PostgreSQL DB directly. This way when user becomes online he can immediately read his offline messages without waiting until the data reach to database replicas of this particular zone 
- Make sure your application logic and Redis Cache Cluster is set up such that whenever a new message arrives, it's either stored into cache or updated if already present in cache. When user becomes online from his side he will always get messages not only form DB but also cached ones until the time of last update to database
- Use Google Stackdriver metrics & logs for monitoring Redis Cache Cluster health and performance stats
