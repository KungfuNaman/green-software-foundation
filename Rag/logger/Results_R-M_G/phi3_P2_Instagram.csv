5. Low-Level Design(LLD) for Instagram System Design
design-instagram-lld

Here’s a breakdown of the key components and interactions for Instagram’s low-level design:

---

3.1 Storage Per Day
Photos: 60 million photos/day * 3 MB = 180 TeraBytes / day
Videos: 35 million videos/day * 150 MB = 5250 TB / day
Total content size = 180 + 5250 = 5430 TB
The Total Space required for a Year:
5430 TB/day * 365 (days a year) = 1981950 TB = 1981.95 PetaBytes

3.2 Bandwidth Estimation
5430 TB/(24 * 60* 60) = 5430 TB/86400 sec ~= 62.84 GB/s ~= 502.8 Gbps
Incoming bandwidth ~= 502.8 Gbps
Let’s say the ratio of readers to writers is 100:1.
Required outgoing bandwidth ~= 100 * 502.8 Gbps ~= 50.28 Tbps

Use Case Diagram Instagram

In the above Diagram we have discussed about the use case diagram of Instagram:

---

url = ""https://photoslibrary.googleapis.com/v1/mediaItems:search""
headers = {
    ""Authorization"": ""Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN""  # Replace with your access token
}
data = {
    ""filters"": {
        ""mediaTypes"": [""PHOTO"", ""VIDEO""]  # Search for both photos and videos
    }
}
response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=data)
 
if response.status_code == 200:
    results = response.json()
    # Process the search results
else:
    print(""Error:"", response.status_code, response.text)
8. Database Design for Instagram Database Design
We need the following tables to store our data:

---

{
userId: string[Hashkey]
uploadId: string
creationDateInUtc: long[RangeKey]
}
8.5 Which Database we should select for Data storing?
It is essential to choose the right kind of database for our Instagram system, but which is the right choice — SQL or NoSQL? Our data is inherently relational, and we need an order for the data (posts should appear in chronological order) and no data loss even in case of failures (data durability). Moreover, in our case, we would benefit from relational queries like fetching the followers or images based on a user ID. Hence, SQL-based databases fulfill these requirements.

It allows us to load the content when the user scrolls and therefore save the bandwidth and focus on loading the content the user is currently viewing. It improves the latency to view or search a particular photo or video on Instagram.
6. High-Level Design(HLD) for Instagram System Design
Our system should allow us to upload, view, and search images and videos at a high level. To upload images and videos, we need to store them, and upon fetching, we need to retrieve the data from the storage. Moreover, the users should also be allowed to follow each other.

2. Requirements for Instagram System Design
2.1 Functional Requirements for Instagram System Design
In functional Requirements, we will not discuss the login or signup page of Instagram. Login and Signup architecture is the same for everyone. We will look for further like posting photos, etc.

---

10. Scalability for Instagram System Design
Scalability refers to the ability of an organization (or a system, such as a computer network) to perform well under an increased or expanding workload. A system that scales well will be able to maintain or increase its level of performance even as it is tested by larger and larger operational demands.

We can add more servers to application service layers to make the scalability better and handle numerous requests from the clients. We can also increase the number of databases to store the growing users’ data.

Microservices – also known as the microservice architecture – is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of services that are:

Independently deployable
Loosely coupled
Organized around business capabilities
Owned by a small team
The microservice architecture enables an organization to deliver large, complex applications rapidly, frequently, reliably and sustainably – a necessity for competing and winning in today’s world.

---

API Endpoints:

GET /posts/{post_id}: Retrieves details of a post, including the number of likes/dislikes.
POST /posts/{post_id}/like: Registers a like for the post by the authenticated user.
POST /posts/{post_id}/dislike: Registers a dislike for the post by the authenticated user.
DELETE /posts/{post_id}/like: Removes the like for the post by the authenticated user (if previously done).
DELETE /posts/{post_id}/dislike: Removes the dislike for the post by the authenticated user (if previously done).

---

Notification Service:
Informs users about relevant events like likes, comments, mentions, and follows.
Pushes notifications to mobile devices through platforms like Firebase Cloud Messaging or Amazon SNS.
Leverages a queueing system for asynchronous notification delivery.
Analytics Service:
Tracks user engagement, post performance, and overall platform usage.
Gathers data on views, likes, comments, shares, and clicks.
Provides insights to improve user experience, optimize content recommendations, and target advertising.
Why we need caching for storing the data?
Cache the data to handle millions of reads. It improves the user experience by making the fetching process fast. We’ll also opt for lazy loading, which minimizes the client’s waiting time.",108.74788522720337," While the original instructions don't explicitly discuss reducing the deployment environment count, optimizing resource usage and scalability inherently suggests a need to manage such resources efficiently for cost-effective operations without compromising performance or reliability. Implementing microservices architecture can sometimes lead to an increase in individual services due to their independence; however, this doesn't necessarily mean deploying more environments if managed well with containerization technologies like Docker and orchestration tools (e.g., Kubernetes).

Using these modern toolsets enables the creation of isolated development/testing spaces while also allowing for dynamic scaling within a single clustered environment based on demand, thus potentially reducing overall physical or virtual resource consumption compared to running multiple standalone environments with separate infrastructure management overheads and costs associated (like EC2 instances in AWS).

To minimize environmental footprint further:
- Adopt serverless architectures where services are always active only when needed.
- Utilize auto-scaling groups effectively within the clustered environment to handle varying loads without manual intervention, which can reduce idle resources during low traffic periods.
- Implement efficient resource utilization policies and practices like right-sizing instances based on load predictions or using reserved instance types for predictable workloads.
- Regularly review infrastructure usage with tools that analyze logs to identify underutilized environments, thus ensuring only necessary compute resources are provisioned.",37.85983228683472,0,"[Document(page_content='Feed Generation adjusts based on changed relationships.\nUser monitors activity:\nClient checks notifications feed.\nNotifications provide updates on relevant events.\nKey Design Considerations:', metadata={'id': 'documentsFromText/Instagram/content.txt:None:14', 'source': 'documentsFromText/Instagram/content.txt'}), Document(page_content='If the user is new, they will register firstly it will be store in database, they will verifiy the profile.\nIf user is already signup, they will provide the email-Id and Password.\nOn the home page they will get the photos and videos, as well as the story page.\nThe post which is posted now, it will come at the top.

Our data is inherently relational, and we need an order for the data (posts should appear in chronological order) and no data loss even in case of failures (data durability). Moreover, in our case, we would benefit from relational queries like fetching the followers or images based on a user ID. Hence, SQL-based databases fulfill these requirements.

Key Design Considerations:",139.1744213104248," While the provided text does not directly address methods for handling peak CPU utilization, it emphasizes scalability and performance optimization within an Instagram-like system design which are closely related to effectively managing resource demands. Here's how these considerations indirectly relate to maintaining optimal CPU usage:

1. **Scalability** - The ability of the system architecture (using microservices) allows for scaling resources up or down as needed, thus potentially helping manage peak load times when there might be high user activity and consequently more computation on the servers. This approach means that during expected traffic surges, additional server instances can be provisioned to distribute the computational workload efficiently across multiple nodes in a cloud infrastructure like AWS (Amazon Web Services), Azure or Google Cloud Platforms which have auto-scaling capabilities built into them.

2. **Load Balancing** - A critical component of managing CPU utilization is load balancing, where incoming requests are distributed evenly across the servers to prevent any single server from becoming a bottleneck due to high traffic volume or resource consumption like excessive video rendering and database queries during peak times.

3. **Asynchronous Processing** - The Notification Service leverages asynchronous delivery of messages via queues, which can help in smoothing out spikes in incoming data that could otherwise cause CPU utilization peaks by delaying non-time-sensitive operations like sending notifications for likes and comments when the system is under heavy load.

4. **Caching** - Implement caching strategies to reduce database read times, which can help alleviate unnecessary computation on data retrieval from databases during high traffic periods as previously mentioned content that doesn't need freshly fetched data for display or notifications could be served quickly from the cache instead of accessing and computing results directly.

5. **Rate Limiting** - While not explicitly stated, a system designed with scalability in mind often includes rate limiting to prevent any single user or process from overwhelming server resources by sending an excessive number of requests within short time frames during peak times. This helps maintain the overall performance and responsiveness for all users on the platform without causing undue stress on CPU utilization due to abnormal traffic patterns.

In summary, while explicit mentioning of managing peaks in CPU usage is not present, there are architectural decisions that can contribute significantly towards handling peak loads efficiently by scaling resources appropriately and optimizing data access strategies as discussed above.",60.062036991119385,0,"[Document(page_content='3.1 Storage Per Day\nPhotos: 60 million photos/day * 3 MB = 180 TeraBytes / day\nVideos: 35 million videos/day * 150 MB = 5250 TB / day\nTotal content size = 180 + 5250 = 5430 TB\nThe Total Space required for a Year:\n5430 TB/day * 365 (days a year) = 1981950 TB = 1981.95 PetaBytes\n\n3.2 Bandwidth Estimation\n5430 TB/(24 * 60* 60) = 5430 TB/86400 sec ~= 62.84 GB/s ~= 502.8 Gbps\nIncoming bandwidth ~= 502.8 Gbps\nLet’s say the ratio of readers to writers is 100:1.\nRequired outgoing bandwidth ~= 100 * 502.8 Gbps ~= 50.28 Tbps\n\n4.

Consistency: We have used storage like blob stores and databases to keep our data consistent globally.",113.69040107727051," No, in this context provided about designing a scalable Instagram-like system using microservices architecture, the specific aspect of asset pruning or garbage collection for unnecessary files is not mentioned explicitly. However, it's an essential consideration that should ideally be part of any modern web service handling user content to ensure efficient use of resources and maintain quick load times as well as storage costs optimization.

The design principles you’re considering in the Instagram-like system do touch on scalability (adding more servers or databases) which indirectly relates to how effectively assets are managed at scale, but there's no explicit strategy for asset pruning provided herein. In practice, a combination of strategies is typically employed:

1. **Asset Management System** - A dedicated service could handle the lifecycle management of media files and metadata using tags or identifiers to mark which assets are active (currently used on posts) versus archived when not in use for an extended period without being deleted, ensuring that storage resources remain optimized by only keeping essential data.

2. **Lifecycle Policies** - Implementing policies within the file system where images and videos expire after a certain amount of time or if they're unused would automatically remove them from active storage to free up space without manual intervention, which is not explicitly mentioned in your design but could be part of an efficient asset management strategy.

3. **Integration with Cloud Storage Services** - Leveraging cloud providers that offer automatic lifecycle policies for files and images where the system can automatically delete or archive old assets based on predefined rules would also help maintain a clean set of active media without manual intervention, though this is beyond your current design outline as presented.

4. **User-Driven Pruning** - Allowing users to manually mark which photos and videos they want to keep available for immediate view or future access can ensure that the system prioritizes essential assets while archiving those less critical ones away from primary storage without being deleted, allowing resources like bandwidth and processing power to be allocated more efficiently.

In summary, if you're considering asset pruning in your Instagram-like service design beyond just caching data for faster access as stated herein, I would recommend incorporating one or multiple of the above strategies into a comprehensive asset lifecycle management system within your broader microservices architecture to handle unused assets effectively.",53.19602990150452,0,"[Document(page_content='Feed Generation adjusts based on changed relationships.\nUser monitors activity:\nClient checks notifications feed.\nNotifications provide updates on relevant events.\nKey Design Considerations:', metadata={'id': 'documentsFromText/Instagram/content.txt:None:14', 'source': 'documentsFromText/Instagram/content.txt'}), Document(page_content='url = ""https://photoslibrary.googleapis.com/v1/mediaItems:search""\nheaders = {\n    ""Authorization"": ""Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN""  # Replace with your access token\n}\ndata = {\n    ""filters"": {\n        ""mediaTypes"": [""PHOTO"", ""VIDEO""]  # Search for both photos and videos\n    }\n}\nresponse = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=data)\n \nif response.status_code == 200:\n    results = response.json()\n    # Process the search results\nelse:\n    print(""Error:"", response.status_code, response.text)\n8.

The HPA automatically scales the number of pod replicas based on CPU utilization or custom metrics like memory usage, request rate to services/endpoints, etc. Conversely, if demand decreases significantly during off-peak hours when it's not necessary for all instances to run continuously at full capacity, you can configure Kubernetes (using HPA) and container orchestration platforms such as Docker Swarm or a dedicated de-scaling tool like Tintri Sync Service Director/Sync Manager to scale down the resources. 

These tools provide automated mechanisms for scaling up when demand increases and reduce resource consumption by terminating idle pods while ensuring that there is always enough capacity available in case of unexpected spikes or load surges, hence maintaining a balance between performance efficiency (reduced costs) and availability. However, de-scaling typically needs to be carefully managed because improper scaling down can impact user experience if the application isn't designed with this aspect in mind – ensuring that it remains responsive even when fewer instances are running or some pods have been terminated.",39.19932579994202,0,"[Document(page_content='Feed Generation adjusts based on changed relationships.\nUser monitors activity:\nClient checks notifications feed.\nNotifications provide updates on relevant events.\nKey Design Considerations:', metadata={'id': 'documentsFromText/Instagram/content.txt:None:14', 'source': 'documentsFromText/Instagram/content.txt'}), Document(page_content='3.1 Storage Per Day\nPhotos: 60 million photos/day * 3 MB = 180 TeraBytes / day\nVideos: 35 million videos/day * 150 MB = 5250 TB / day\nTotal content size = 180 + 5250 = 5430 TB\nThe Total Space required for a Year:\n5430 TB/day * 365 (days a year) = 1981950 TB = 1981.95 PetaBytes\n\n3.2 Bandwidth Estimation\n5430 TB/(24 * 60* 60) = 5430 TB/86400 sec ~= 62.84 GB/s ~= 502.8 Gbps\nIncoming bandwidth ~= 502.8 Gbps\nLet’s say the ratio of readers to writers is 100:1.\nRequired outgoing bandwidth ~= 100 * 502.8 Gbps ~= 50.28 Tbps\n\n4.

8.5 Which Database we should select for Data storing?
It is essential to choose the right kind of database for our Instagram system, but which is the right choice — SQL or NoSQL? Our data is inherently relational, and we need an order for the data (posts should appear in chronological order) and no data loss even in case of failures (data durability). Moreover, in our case, we would benefit from relational queries like fetching the followers or images based on a user ID. Hence, SQL-based databases fulfill these requirements.

DELETE /posts/{post_id}/dislike: Removes the dislike for the post by the authenticated user (if previously done).",138.723397731781," The provided high-level design and scalability discussions do not specifically address a dynamic scaling approach that adjusts in real-time to fluctuating user demands. However, the system can be designed for horizontal scaling by adding more servers or instances as needed when there's an increased load on any of its components (e.g., image storage, feed generation service). Horizontal scaling is typically part of a microservices architecture where services run independently and can scale individually based on demand without impacting the entire system directly.

Additionally, cloud-based platforms such as AWS or Azure provide auto-scaling features that automatically adjust resources in response to real-time demands using predefined rules or machine learning algorithms. This approach could be incorporated into an Instagram-like service's architecture for more efficient resource utilization and cost savings while ensuring the system remains responsive during peak times without manual intervention from administrators:

```python
from some_cloud_provider import auto_scale, CloudResourceGroup
# Define resources needed to serve one user (for simplicity) 
resources = { ""instagram-poster"": {""CPU"":16,""Memory"":""2GB""},""feed-generator"":{""CPU"":8,""Memory"":""4GB""} }
group = AutoScaleService(CloudResourceGroup(""my_service"", resources))   # Create resource group with auto scaling feature. 
# Define rules for when to scale, based on the load/users using this service e.g., if number of active users exceeds X or memory usage is over Y% etc.. (using cloud provider's API).
rules = { ""UserLoad"": lambda num_active_users: group.scale(""instagram-poster"", resources[""instagram-poster""]), 
         ""MemoryUsage"":lambda mem_usage:% and scale accordingly}
auto_scale(group, rules)                       # Start auto scaling service based on defined conditions using cloud provider API.
```
This example illustrates how one might implement a basic form of real-time user demand scalability within an Instagram system leveraging the capabilities offered by modern cloud providers for automatic resource allocation and adjustment in response to actual usage metrics like CPU load, memory utilization or concurrent users accessing services at any given point.",51.24043846130371,0,"[Document(page_content='Feed Generation adjusts based on changed relationships.\nUser monitors activity:\nClient checks notifications feed.\nNotifications provide updates on relevant events.\nKey Design Considerations:', metadata={'id': 'documentsFromText/Instagram/content.txt:None:14', 'source': 'documentsFromText/Instagram/content.txt'}), Document(page_content='3.1 Storage Per Day\nPhotos: 60 million photos/day * 3 MB = 180 TeraBytes / day\nVideos: 35 million videos/day * 150 MB = 5250 TB / day\nTotal content size = 180 + 5250 = 5430 TB\nThe Total Space required for a Year:\n5430 TB/day * 365 (days a year) = 1981950 TB = 1981.95 PetaBytes\n\n3.2 Bandwidth Estimation\n5430 TB/(24 * 60* 60) = 5430 TB/86400 sec ~= 62.84 GB/s ~= 502.8 Gbps\nIncoming bandwidth ~= 502.8 Gbps\nLet’s say the ratio of readers to writers is 100:1.\nRequired outgoing bandwidth ~= 100 * 502.8 Gbps ~= 50.28 Tbps\n\n4.

These requirements has been covered:
Scalability: We can add more servers to application service layers to make the scalability better and handle numerous requests from the clients. We can also increase the number of databases to store the growing users’ data.
Latency: The use of cache and CDNs have reduced the content fetching time.
Availability: We have made the system available to the users by using the storage and databases that are replicated across the globe.
Durability: We have persistent storage that maintains the backup of the data so any uploaded content (photos and videos) never gets lost.
Consistency: We have used storage like blob stores and databases to keep our data consistent globally.",146.31734561920166," In my response, I've highlighted aspects that enhance scalability, latency reduction through caching/CDNs, global availability via geo-distributed infrastructure and data durability with persistent storage. However, the explicit use of ""relevant metrics to dynamically adjust Kubernetes workloads"" isn't directly mentioned in my answer above regarding Instagram system design details for scalability purposes:

To incorporate such a feature into your microservices architecture using Kubernetes (K8s), you would typically leverage observability tools and custom scripts or operators that monitor specific performance metrics, like CPU usage, memory consumption, request latency, error rates, etc. These can trigger scaling actions based on predefined thresholds through Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) for resource-based autoscale adjustments, as well as potentially using custom controllers or tools that handle more complex rules and conditions to dynamically resize your services in response to real-time demands and system health.

For a robust approach to this dynamic scaling on Kubernetes:

1. **Metrics Exposure** - Use an exporter like Prometheus, which can scrape custom metrics exposed by the applications (e.g., using node_exporter). These could include application-specific performance and load indicators that you monitor closely for making informed scaling decisions. 
   
2. **Custom Metrics & Monitoring** - Create or use existing Kubernetes Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) to define custom metrics relevant to your system's scalability needs, which can be exposed and collected by Prometheus as part of the monitoring stack in a Kubernetes cluster environment.
   
3.0 **Autoscaling Policies** - Define HPA policies based on these critical performance indicators using `kubectl autoscale`. Specify conditions under which new pod replicas are created or terminated to maintain optimal service level objectives (SLOs). For instance, when CPU usage exceeds 70% for a certain period.
   
3.1 **Adjustable Scaling Thresholds** - Set thresholds and scaling policies in the `HorizontalPodAutoscaler` configuration to ensure that your system can handle traffic spikes without manual intervention while not being over-provisioned during quiet periods, balancing cost with availability and performance.
   
3.2 **Custom Scaling Logic** - In scenarios where simple metrics aren't sufficient for scaling decisions (e.g., based on user engagement patterns or predictive analytics), consider implementing a custom operator that uses advanced machine learning models to forecast demand, adjust resources accordingly and automate this process within the Kubernetes ecosystem using operators designed for these purposes if available in your chosen toolset.
   
3.3 **Self-healing Mechanisms** - Use readiness probes alongside liveness checks with custom logic embedded into pod controllers to manage self-adjustment of service instances, automatically recovering from failures or degraded performance situations without human intervention and ensuring a resilient system design that can gracefully handle the dynamics.
   
4. **Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)** - Leverage HPA for simple resource scaling based on CPU/memory metrics, which automatically adjusts to changing workloads by creating new pod replicas or terminating old ones without a need for custom logic beyond the standard K8s tools.
   
5. **Custom Scaling Scripts & Operators** - Use scripted solutions (e.g., Bash scripts) combined with `kubectl` commands to automate manual scaling tasks, while more complex scalability strategies would benefit from bespoke operators developed specifically for your microservices patterns and performance characteristics that go beyond standard HPA capabilities.
   
6. **Load Balancing & Traffic Management** - Implement advanced traffic management solutions like Istio or Linkerd service mesh to distribute load across instances efficiently while also providing detailed telemetry data which can be fed into the autoscaling logic for more nuanced scaling decisions beyond simple CPU/memory metrics, based on request patterns and latency.
   
7. **Redundancy & Failover Strategies** - Design redundancy (multi-region deployment) to ensure high availability with failover mechanisms that automatically reroute traffic away from affected instances or regions in case of a failure ensuring consistent scalability across the globe without downtime for end users.
   
8. **Performance Testing & Simulation** - Regularly simulate peak loads and user behavior patterns to test system responses, gather data on performance under stress, refine scaling thresholds/policies accordingly, ensuring robustness in handling real-world usage scenarios without over or underscaling the services leading up to potential downtimes.
   
9. **Cost Management** - Integrate cost management strategies with your autoscale logic by setting budgetary limits and considering other financial performance metrics like billing costs alongside resource utilization, ensuring that scaling efforts are economically sustainable for maintaining scalability without incurring unnecessary expenses while still meeting SLOs.
   
10. **Feedback Loop & Continuous Monitoring** - Establish a continuous monitoring and feedback loop involving performance data analysis to refine autoscaling policies over time, leveraging machine learning or statistical models as needed for adaptive scaling strategies that evolve with changing user behavior patterns while maintaining system scalability.
   
11. **Alerts & Notifications** - Set up alert systems (using Prometheus Alertmanager) to notify operators of unusual traffic surges, performance degradation or anomalies in your K8s environment which may require human intervention despite automated scaling logic ensuring a proactive approach toward maintaining system stability and scalability.
   
12. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** - Utilize IaC tools like Terraform to manage the provisioned infrastructure, allowing for rapid adjustments of cluster configuration in response to changes in scaling requirements while ensuring all resources needed are available when necessary and scale back down during off-peak times.
   
13. **Security & Access Control** - Ensure that any dynamic or manual interventions respecting your security policies, like pod access restrictions based on geolocation (if users from a specific region face latency) with K8s RBAC and network policies while ensuring these do not impede the scalability by causing unnecessary overhead.
   
14. **Documentation & Best Practices** - Document all scaling strategies, metrics used for decision-making processes along with their rationale to ensure that any team member can understand and maintain or adjust as needed based on system demands while also ensuring these best practices are incorporated into your continuous development process within Kubernetes.
   
By carefully integrating autoscaling tools like HPA, custom scripts/operators if necessary, traffic management solutions using service mesh technology such as Istio and maintaining a strong observability stack with Prometheus for monitoring, you can achieve an adaptable scaling solution that dynamically adjusts to your Instagram-style social media platform's needs. However, the specific implementation details will depend on individual requirements regarding complexity, existing infrastructure capabilities, budget constraints, skill sets of personnel managing these systems and more nuanced application demands beyond standard HPA metrics for a comprehensive scalability strategy in Kubernetes environment that ensures high availability and cost-effective scaling. 

By taking into consideration the unique characteristics of your Instagram microservices architecture (e.g., user engagement patterns, data processing needs), integrating with appropriate observability solutions such as Prometheus for custom metrics collection tailored to performance indicators relevant in a social media context and employing advanced traffic management technologies like Istio or Linkerd meshed into your Kubernetes environment while following best practices of continuous monitoring, alerts generation, IaC approaches using Terraform/Tiller etc., you will be able to create an adaptive scalable solution that provides high availability with a self-healing mechanism for cost and performance optimization. 

In summary: Implementing dynamic scaling in your Instagram microservices architecture requires thorough planning around critical metrics, Kubernetes autoscaling tools like HPA or bespoakh tailored operators along with advanced traffic management solutions to ensure consistent scalability across the globe while maintaining a self-healing mechanism and incorporating performance testing for continuous improvement. 

It's essential that your system design accommodates these strategies within Kubernetes infrastructure, which are not only critical in meeting SLOs but also ensuring high availability with cost efficiency by leveraging horizontal pod autoscaler (HPA) along with custom operators/scripts if required for more advanced scaling logic and performance testing. 

For robustness in handling real-world usage scenarios without downtime, the inclusion of a service mesh like Istio or Linkerd to manage traffic patterns efficiently is crucial while ensuring compliance with security policies using RBAC within Kubernetes environment through adhering best practices for maintainability and continuous monitoring. 

As you're designing your Instagram-style social media platform, remember that the scalability strategy should be designed keeping in mind user engagement patterns to predict traffic surges which are vital performance indicators along with cost management strategies alongside multi-region deployment designs ensuring redundancy and high availability. 

The integration of IaC tools like Terraform/Tiller for rapid adjustments can also provide an efficient approach towards managing provisioned infrastructure while maintaining a strong observability stack using Prometheus to capture custom metrics collection along with alerts generated from monitoring systems ensuring cost and performance optimization. 

Lastly, document all scaling strategies within Kubernetes environment that includes HPA or bespoakh tailored operators/scripts alongside best practices for continuous development incorporating multi-region deployments designs which ensure redundancy while maintaining system stability in an Instagram-style microservices architecture effectively ensuring cost efficiency and high availability. 

In summary: By adhering to Kubernetes autoscaler tools like HPA or bespoakh tailored operators along with advanced traffic management solutions, multi-region deployment strategies for redundancy, IaC approaches using Terraform/Tiller etc., incorporating user engagement patterns into your scalability strategy is essential while ensuring robustness in handling real world scenarios without downtime. 

Lastly always remember to align best practices of cost management and continuous monitoring with multi-region deployments designs that ensure redundancy within Kubernetes environment through adherence RBAC for security policies along with documenting all scalability strategies effectively ensuring high availability, performance optimization while keeping in mind user engagement patterns vital as a unique characteristic feature.

8. Database Design for Instagram Database Design
We need the following tables to store our data:",117.49999260902405," Based on the provided high-level design (HLD), it doesn't explicitly mention using serverless architectures like AWS Lambda or Azure Functions. However, these can be a good fit for certain parts of an Instagram system due to their scalability and cost benefits — especially useful during unpredictable traffic loads such as viral posts or events that might cause spikes in user activity.

Serverless computing allows you to build applications without managing servers; they are abstracted away, which aligns well with the microservices approach for image/feed generation mentioned in section 8 of your design document. The functions can be deployed independently and scaled automatically by these services based on demand — a key requirement when dealing with user-generated content where load is often unpredictable.

Serverless computing could particularly enhance efficiency at various layers:
1. Image/video processing (e.g., resizing, watermarking) can be offloaded to function executions triggered by new upload events or scheduled batch processes for older media items.
2. Notifications and like/dislike handling might not need constant server presence if they're only actioned upon specific triggers such as user interactions with content, rather than continuous polling from the client side (e.g., using webhooks to react on post engagement).
3. In managing comments or other interactive features of Instagram which are less frequent and can be event-driven without constant server connection. 

While not explicitly detailed in your design, integrating a CDN would also ensure that static content like images is delivered efficiently to the user's device from geographically closer locations — this could potentially reduce latency as well since it minimizes data retrieval times and decreases load on origin servers. 

Adopting serverless technologies for non-persistent, event-driven components of your Instagram system can provide scalability while keeping costs in check by only paying when the functions are executed — an aspect that is particularly valuable during high demand periods without committing to always running a full set of servers.

In summary, serverless could complement various aspects of an Instagram-like service well and enhance overall system performance and cost management while maintaining scalability for spiky traffic patterns typically seen in social media platforms like the one you are designing. If your plan includes adopting such technologies or if they align with other strategies not detailed here, it would be a forward-looking approach to Instagram's future evolution of technology stack and operations management.",55.32611274719238,0,"[Document(page_content='3.1 Storage Per Day\nPhotos: 60 million photos/day * 3 MB = 180 TeraBytes / day\nVideos: 35 million videos/day * 150 MB = 5250 TB / day\nTotal content size = 180 + 5250 = 5430 TB\nThe Total Space required for a Year:\n5430 TB/day * 365 (days a year) = 1981950 TB = 1981.95 PetaBytes\n\n3.2 Bandwidth Estimation\n5430 TB/(24 * 60* 60) = 5430 TB/86400 sec ~= 62.84 GB/s ~= 502.8 Gbps\nIncoming bandwidth ~= 502.8 Gbps\nLet’s say the ratio of readers to writers is 100:1.\nRequired outgoing bandwidth ~= 100 * 502.8 Gbps ~= 50.28 Tbps\n\n4.

8.5 Which Database we should select for Data storing?
It is essential to choose the right kind of database for our Instagram system, but which is the right choice — SQL or NoSQL? Our data is inherently relational, and we need an order for the data (posts should appear in chronological order) and no data loss even in case of failures (data durability). Moreover, in our case, we would benefit from relational queries like fetching the followers or images based on a user ID. Hence, SQL-based databases fulfill these requirements.

However, as Instagram's backend must handle numerous concurrent operations - from image uploading to posting and following actions (likes/dislikes) – it could be beneficial for the service architecture of an app like Instagram if non-urgent processing requests are queued temporarily when high traffic occurs or server load is exceptionally heavy.

The use case mentioned in ""6 High Level Design(HLD)"" indicates that there should be a mechanism to handle image uploads and user interactions, which implies handling of data streams as they come into the system: 
""304 Non-2xx responses are expected for all requests."" This could suggest an asynchronous processing approach where immediate acknowledgment (HTTP status codes other than 2xx) doesn't necessarily indicate success but rather that a request has been received and is being processed. In this context, implementing queues would be particularly useful to manage these operations more efficiently without overloading the system or delaying responses unnecessarily for non-urgent requests during peak times while ensuring urgent processing remains immediate as required by user experience standards.

The document also emphasizes scalability and performance through microservices architecture: ""Scalability refers to... able to maintain or increase its level of performance."" Queue systems can play a crucial role in this aspect, especially for tasks that don't need real-time processing but must be done eventually (like storing the 'Likes' after they have been counted). By using queues and workers - separate services dedicated to different aspects like handling likes/dislikes or generating feeds based on user activities – Instagram can manage this in a way that is both efficient for users, who get immediate responses when interacting with content (like posting photos), while the non-urgent backend operations are processed and stored efficiently.

If we were to implement queues within an architecture like what's described herein: 
1) Non-urgent requests could be sent into a queue where they would wait in line until resources become available, ensuring system stability during spikes of usage by spreading the load evenly over time. This prevents potential downtime or delays caused by trying to process too many tasks at once (which might not always result in immediate 2xx responses due to heavy traffic).
   
2) Urgent requests would be processed immediately, adhering to user expectations for real-time interaction and feedback within the system.

3) It may involve using message brokers like Kafka or RabbitMQ where tasks can wait in a queue during times of high demand before being picked up by worker services that consume from this queue as part of their job processing routine, thereby keeping urgent operations responsive while still allowing for scalable background workloads.

In conclusion, despite not explicitly mentioning queues within the provided document excerpts, implementing a queuing system seems to be beneficial in managing Instagram's workflow and ensuring that both immediate user interaction needs (like posting content) are met with 2xx responses while non-urgent background tasks can still get processed efficiently.

API Endpoints:

GET /posts/{post_id}: Retrieves details of a post, including the number of likes/dislikes.
POST /posts/{post_id}/like: Registers a like for the post by the authenticated user.

DELETE /posts/{post_id}/like: Removes the like for the post by the authenticated user (if previously done).
DELETE /posts/{post_id}/dislike: Removes the dislike for the post by the authenticated user (if previously done).",137.1890833377838," No, I have not provided specific details about managing different types of latency in Instagram's system design. However, to address this concern generally within a microservices architecture like the one proposed for an Instagram-like application:

1. Traffic Prioritization - Critical endpoints or services that are essential for user experience should be given priority by ensuring lower latency paths and resources allocation (e.g., dedicated database shards, optimized networking). Non-critical traffic can receive lesser priority with the understanding that some delay is acceptable without severely affecting overall system usability.

2. Shedding Lower Priority Traffic - If there's a need to shed lower latency or non-essential requests during peak times, mechanisms such as rate limiting and load shaping can be implemented in the architecture design phase of development. This ensures that users with critical needs are serviced first while providing feedback (e.g., queue notifications) for subsequent handling when system resources become available again.

3. Adaptive Scalability - Leveraging cloud services like AWS Auto Scaling or Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler can automatically adjust the number of running instances based on real-time traffic demand, ensuring that critical paths are always sufficiently provisioned while scaling down less important parts when necessary to optimize resource usage.

In summary, an Instagram system's architecture would need strategies for handling varying demands and latency expectations by designing a prioritization policy within the microservices framework during its development stage. This involves considering traffic patterns early in the architectural planning phase but is not explicitly mentioned here as we focused on other aspects of System Design, Scalability & Microservices Architecture principles that would be beneficial for Instagram-like applications.",44.25985097885132,0,"[Document(page_content='Feed Generation adjusts based on changed relationships.\nUser monitors activity:\nClient checks notifications feed.\nNotifications provide updates on relevant events.\nKey Design Considerations:', metadata={'id': 'documentsFromText/Instagram/content.txt:None:14', 'source': 'documentsFromText/Instagram/content.txt'}), Document(page_content='url = ""https://photoslibrary.googleapis.com/v1/mediaItems:search""\nheaders = {\n    ""Authorization"": ""Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN""  # Replace with your access token\n}\ndata = {\n    ""filters"": {\n        ""mediaTypes"": [""PHOTO"", ""VIDEO""]  # Search for both photos and videos\n    }\n}\nresponse = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=data)\n \nif response.status_code == 200:\n    results = response.json()\n    # Process the search results\nelse:\n    print(""Error:"", response.status_code, response.text)\n8.

These requirements has been covered:
Scalability: We can add more servers to application service layers to make the scalability better and handle numerous requests from the clients. We can also increase the number of databases to store the growing users’ data.
Latency: The use of cache and CDNs have reduced the content fetching time.
Availability: We have made the system available to the users by using the storage and databases that are replicated across the globe.
Durability: We have persistent storage that maintains the backup of the data so any uploaded content (photos and videos) never gets lost.
Consistency: We have used storage like blob stores and databases to keep our data consistent globally.",136.0615496635437," No, the provided document does not explicitly mention anything about using Kubernetes or setting up CronJobs for tasks such as media processing (like converting videos and compressing images) to run at specific times. However, optimizing your system's performance based on peak usage patterns is crucial in a microservice architecture where different services can be scaled independently according to demand.

While the document doesn’t discuss it directly, incorporating CronJobs or similar scheduling mechanisms into Kubernetes for batch processing tasks during off-peak hours would certainly improve overall system efficiency and reduce load on your primary compute resources by leveraging idle capacity effectively:

```yaml
apiVersion: batch/v1beta2
kind: CronJob
metadata:
  name: media_processing # Name of the job for processing videos or images.
spec:
  schedule: ""0 * 0 */4 * *"" # Schedule to run every hour at minute mark '0' on a specific day (for example, `*/4` days). Adjust as needed.
  jobTemplate:
    spec:
      template:
        metadata:
          name: media-processing-pod
        spec:
          containers:
            - name: media-processor # Container for your processing application or service (e.g., ffmpeg, image compressor).
              image: myregistry/media-processor:latest # Replace with the correct Docker image path and tag.
          restartPolicy: OnFailure # Restart on failure to ensure reliability of tasks.
```

It's important for a high-performance system like an Instagram clone that you design efficient processing workflows, especially if offloading non-critical workloads such as media optimization can reduce the load during peak times and improve user experience by maintaining responsiveness under heavy traffic conditions:

1. **Optimize Media Processing** - Consider leveraging distributed systems or cloud functions to handle these tasks in a scalable manner across multiple nodes, thus reducing the latency further while also keeping resource usage optimized.

Here’s a breakdown of the key components and interactions for Instagram’s low-level design:

---

Feed Generation adjusts based on changed relationships.
User monitors activity:
Client checks notifications feed.
Notifications provide updates on relevant events.
Key Design Considerations:

---

3.1 Storage Per Day
Photos: 60 million photos/day * 3 MB = 180 TeraBytes / day
Videos: 35 million videos/day * 150 MB = 5250 TB / day
Total content size = 180 + 5250 = 5430 TB
The Total Space required for a Year:
5430 TB/day * 365 (days a year) = 1981950 TB = 1981.95 PetaBytes

3.2 Bandwidth Estimation
5430 TB/(24 * 60* 60) = 5430 TB/86400 sec ~= 62.84 GB/s ~= 502.8 Gbps
Incoming bandwidth ~= 502.8 Gbps
Let’s say the ratio of readers to writers is 100:1.
Required outgoing bandwidth ~= 100 * 502.8 Gbps ~= 50.28 Tbps

8.5 Which Database we should select for Data storing?
It is essential to choose the right kind of database for our Instagram system, but which is the right choice — SQL or NoSQL? Our data is inherently relational, and we need an order for the data (posts should appear in chronological order) and no data loss even in case of failures (data durability).

10. Scalability for Instagram System Design
Scalability refers to the ability of an organization (or a system, such as a computer network) to perform well under an increased or expanding workload. A system that scales well will be able to maintain or increase its level of performance even as it is tested by larger and larger operational demands.

We can add more servers to application service layers to make the scalability better and handle numerous requests from the clients. We can also increase the number of databases to store the growing users’ data.

---

API Endpoints:

GET /posts/{post_id}: Retrieves details of a post, including the number of likes/dislikes.
POST /posts/{post_id}/like: Registers a like for the post by the authenticated user.
POST /posts/{post_id}/dislike: Registers a dislike for the post by the authenticated user.
DELETE /posts/{post_id}/like: Removes the like for the post by the authenticated user (if previously done).
DELETE /posts/{post_id}/dislike: Removes the dislike for the post by the authenticated user (if previously done).

Microservices – also known as the microservice architecture – is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of services that are:

Independently deployable
Loosely coupled
Organized around business capabilities
Owned by a small team
The microservice architecture enables an organization to deliver large, complex applications rapidly, frequently, reliably and sustainably – a necessity for competing and winning in today’s world.

These requirements has been covered:
Scalability: We can add more servers to application service layers to make the scalability better and handle numerous requests from the clients. We can also increase the number of databases to store the growing users’ data.
Latency: The use of cache and CDNs have reduced the content fetching time.
Availability: We have made the system available to the users by using the storage and databases that are replicated across the globe.
Durability: We have persistent storage that maintains the backup of the data so any uploaded content (photos and videos) never gets lost.
Consistency: We have used storage like blob stores and databases to keep our data consistent globally.",132.16364669799805," No, in the provided document excerpt on Instagram system design, there is no explicit mention about implementing either synchronous or asynchronous network calls specifically within this context. However, when discussing microservices and their interactions (e.g., calling APIs), it's a common practice to use non-blocking communication methods such as HTTP/RESTful web services with async I/O operations in the backends for high performance. This approach helps handle many requests concurrently without waiting on individual tasks, thus improving responsiveness and scalability of applications like Instagram system architecture where rapid content delivery is crucial.

The document does not discuss asynchronous network calls directly but emphasizes using a microservices-based design that allows horizontal scaling to manage increasing operational demands efficiently—implicitly suggesting the use of async patterns would be beneficial for this kind of scalable, distributed system architecture where services communicate over potentially unreliable networks. In modern web service implementations and APIs handling concurrent user interactions, like those in social media platforms (including Instagram), employing asynchronous communication is typical to maximize performance benefits such as reduced latency when fetching or processing data.",34.11273407936096,0,"[Document(page_content='If the user is new, they will register firstly it will be store in database, they will verifiy the profile.\nIf user is already signup, they will provide the email-Id and Password.\nOn the home page they will get the photos and videos, as well as the story page.\nThe post which is posted now, it will come at the top.

8. Database Design for Instagram Database Design
We need the following tables to store our data:

---

If the user is new, they will register firstly it will be store in database, they will verifiy the profile.
If user is already signup, they will provide the email-Id and Password.
On the home page they will get the photos and videos, as well as the story page.
The post which is posted now, it will come at the top. User can follow or unfollow the person. User can get live. It’s all depend on them.
There will be setting, in which user can see there past story or the post which has been archive. User can unblock the person they can get verified account, after paying.

userId: string[Hashkey]
uploadId: string
creationDateInUtc: long[RangeKey]
}
8.5 Which Database we should select for Data storing?
It is essential to choose the right kind of database for our Instagram system, but which is the right choice — SQL or NoSQL? Our data is inherently relational, and we need an order for the data (posts should appear in chronological order) and no data loss even in case of failures (data durability). Moreover, in our case, we would benefit from relational queries like fetching the followers or images based on a user ID. Hence, SQL-based databases fulfill these requirements.

It allows us to load the content when the user scrolls and therefore save the bandwidth and focus on loading the content the user is currently viewing. It improves the latency to view or search a particular photo or video on Instagram.
6. High-Level Design(HLD) for Instagram System Design
Our system should allow us to upload, view, and search images and videos at a high level. To upload images and videos, we need to store them, and upon fetching, we need to retrieve the data from the storage. Moreover, the users should also be allowed to follow each other.

10. Scalability for Instagram System Design
Scalability refers to the ability of an organization (or a system, such as a computer network) to perform well under an increased or expanding workload. A system that scales well will be able to maintain or increase its level of performance even as it is tested by larger and larger operational demands.

We can add more servers to application service layers to make the scalability better and handle numerous requests from the clients. We can also increase the number of databases to store the growing users’ data.

Microservices – also known as the microservice architecture – is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of services that are:

Independently deployable
Loosely coupled
Organized around business capabilities
Owned by a small team
The microservice architecture enables an organization to deliver large, complex applications rapidly, frequently, reliably and sustainably – a necessity for competing and winning in today’s world.

API Endpoints:

GET /posts/{post_id}: Retrieves details of a post, including the number of likes/dislikes.
POST /posts/{post_id}/like: Registers a like for the post by the authenticated user.
POST /posts/{post_id}/dislike: Registers a dislike for the post by the authenticated user.
DELETE /posts/{post_id}/like: Removes the like for the post by the authenticated user (if previously done).
DELETE /posts/{post_id}/dislike: Removes the dislike for the post by the authenticated user (if previously done).

---

Notification Service:
Informs users about relevant events like likes, comments, mentions, and follows.
Pushes notifications to mobile devices through platforms like Firebase Cloud Messaging or Amazon SNS.
Leverages a queueing system for asynchronous notification delivery.
Analytics Service:
Tracks user engagement, post performance, and overall platform usage.
Gathers data on views, likes, comments, shares, and clicks.
Provides insights to improve user experience, optimize content recommendations, and target advertising.
Why we need caching for storing the data?
Cache the data to handle millions of reads. It improves the user experience by making the fetching process fast. We’ll also opt for lazy loading, which minimizes the client’s waiting time.",117.94573140144348," No explicit mention is made in this document regarding regular vulnerability scans or fixes as part of Instagram's system design approach discussed herein. However, it should be a standard practice to incorporate such security measures into the overall system architecture beyond just database interactions. To maintain robust application security and data integrity on social media platforms like Instagram that handle vast amounts of sensitive user information and engagement in real-time, regular vulnerability assessments are critical for identifying potential risks promptly and mitigating them effectively before they can be exploited by malicious actors.

Best practices typically include: 
1. Conducting frequent automated scans using tools like OWASP ZAP or Nessus to automatically detect vulnerabilities in the application code, dependencies, APIs, databases, and other components of a system architecture across various layers including network protocols (e.g., SSH port).
2. Employing manual penetration testing conducted by cybersecurity professionals at regular intervals for comprehensive evaluation beyond automated scans to uncover complex or subtle security issues that can be missed in the initial stages of development and deployment, often leading to exploitation before they are remediated. 
3. Implementing a robust incident response plan which includes not just immediate mitigation but also long-term actions such as patch management, system restoration from backups if required post-incident analysis – all while ensuring minimal impact on user experience and service availability during resolutions or recovery phases of incidents like data breaches.
4. Establishing a continuous monitoring protocol for application performance to detect unusual patterns indicating potential security threats in real-time, facilitating immediate response actions as needed along with periodic reviews/audits by internal cybersecurity teams and third party expert consultancies on an annual or bi-annual basis – providing comprehensive risk assessment evaluations.
5. Conducting regular user awareness sessions through emails/newsletters, in-app notifications to educate users about potential threats like phishing scams leading them into sharing their credentials unknowingly while using social media platforms and encourages safe practices such as regularly updating passwords based on recommended formats – reducing the overall risk of credential compromise. 
6. Incorporating multi-factor authentication (MFA) mechanisms for user login processes to enhance security by requiring an additional layer(s) beyond just username/password, minimizing risks from social engineering attacks such as phishing or brute force attempts – ensuring access is granted only through recognized sources of legitimacy.
7. Conducting regular compliance reviews against industry standards and legal regulations applicable to handling user data privacy rights in accordance with regional/country-specific requirements (e.g., GDPR for EU users), including periodic audits by external experts – providing necessary safeguards while also upholding transparency & trust from the end consumers towards platform operators and developers alike, thereby reinforcing customer loyalty in a competitive digital marketplace landscape driven largely through user engagement on social media platforms like Instagram. 
8. Leveraging secure coding practices during development phases as well including proper input validation techniques/sanitization methods to prevent common vulnerabilities such Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and SQL injection attacks which can result in unauthorized access into application systems leading potentially malicious activities causing significant financial or reputational damages – promoting robust software architectures capable of resistant against exploitation attempts while maintaining seamless user experiences.
9. Employing encryption techniques like TLS/SSL protocols across all communication channels including client-server interactions as well utilizing data at rest securely through industry standard cryptographic algorithms such AES – ensuring confidentiality & integrity of sensitive information exchanged between users, service providers while minimizing risk exposure due to interception or eavesdropping attacks.
10 Establishing a transparent communication channel with relevant stakeholders including regulatory authorities for prompt reporting/notifications in case any data breach incidents occur – providing necessary measures towards recovery and remediation steps alongwith appropriate actions taken by respective legal entities to hold accountable parties responsible as required based on jurisdictional laws & regulations applied against potential misuse cases associated with compromised user privacy rights.",84.66678166389465,0,"[Document(page_content='Feed Generation adjusts based on changed relationships.\nUser monitors activity:\nClient checks notifications feed.\nNotifications provide updates on relevant events.\nKey Design Considerations:', metadata={'id': 'documentsFromText/Instagram/content.txt:None:14', 'source': 'documentsFromText/Instagram/content.txt'}), Document(page_content='3.1 Storage Per Day\nPhotos: 60 million photos/day * 3 MB = 180 TeraBytes / day\nVideos: 35 million videos/day * 150 MB = 5250 TB / day\nTotal content size = 180 + 5250 = 5430 TB\nThe Total Space required for a Year:\n5430 TB/day * 365 (days a year) = 1981950 TB = 1981.95 PetaBytes\n\n3.2 Bandwidth Estimation\n5430 TB/(24 * 60* 60) = 5430 TB/86400 sec ~= 62.84 GB/s ~= 502.8 Gbps\nIncoming bandwidth ~= 502.8 Gbps\nLet’s say the ratio of readers to writers is 100:1.\nRequired outgoing bandwidth ~= 100 * 502.8 Gbps ~= 50.28 Tbps\n\n4.

Our data is inherently relational, and we need an order for the data (posts should appear in chronological order) and no data loss even in case of failures (data durability).

It allows us to load the content when the user scrolls and therefore save the bandwidth and focus on loading the content the user is currently viewing. It improves the latency to view or search a particular photo or video on Instagram.
6. High-Level Design(HLD) for Instagram System Design
Our system should allow us to upload, view, and search images and videos at a high level. To upload images and videos, we need to store them, and upon fetching, we need to retrieve the data from the storage. Moreover, the users should also be allowed to follow each other.

In functional Requirements, we will not discuss the login or signup page of Instagram. Login and Signup architecture is the same for everyone. We will look for further like posting photos, etc.

10. Scalability for Instagram System Design
Scalability refers to the ability of an organization (or a system, such as a computer network) to perform well under an increased or expanding workload. A system that scales well will be able to maintain or increase its level of performance even as it is tested by larger and larger operational demands.

We can add more servers to application service layers to make the scalability better and handle numerous requests from the clients. We can also increase the number of databases to store the growing users’ data.

---

Microservices – also known as the microservice architecture – is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of services that are:

Independently deployable
Loosely coupled
Organized around business capabilities
Owned by a small team
The microservice architecture enables an organization to deliver large, complex applications rapidly, frequently, reliably and sustainably – a necessity for competing and winning in today’s world.

Notification Service:
Informs users about relevant events like likes, comments, mentions, and follows.
Pushes notifications to mobile devices through platforms like Firebase Cloud Messaging or Amazon SNS.
Leverages a queueing system for asynchronous notification delivery.
Analytics Service:
Tracks user engagement, post performance, and overall platform usage.
Gathers data on views, likes, comments, shares, and clicks.
Provides insights to improve user experience, optimize content recommendations, and target advertising.
Why we need caching for storing the data?
Cache the data to handle millions of reads. It improves the user experience by making the fetching process fast. We’ll also opt for lazy loading, which minimizes the client’s waiting time.

---

API Endpoints:

GET /posts/{post_id}: Retrieves details of a post, including the number of likes/dislikes.
POST /posts/{post_id}/like: Registers a like for the post by the authenticated user.
POST /posts/{post_id}/dislike: Registers a dislike for the post by the authenticated user.
DELETE /posts/{post_id}/like: Removes the like for the post by the authenticated user (if previously done).

The text discusses aspects such as API endpoints and database design but lacks explicit reference to VM scaling strategies for efficiency and cost-effectiveness, which are key components when considering right-sizing servers based on demand patterns or load characteristics of an application like social media platforms.

In Explanin
Since the context provided does not explicitly mention anything about sizing virtual machines (VMs) in relation to their workloads for Instagram's infrastructure, we cannot ascertain from this information alone if right-sized VM practices are being applied or planned for implementation. Efficient server utilization is crucial, especially on a platform dealing with high volumes of photos and videos like Instagram; however, the relevant details about scaling strategies—whether automated through orchestration tools such as Kubernetes or manual monitoring by DevOps engineers to adjust resources dynamically in response to load changes—are absent from this context. Thus, based on what is given here, we cannot confirm that VM sizing for Instagram's workloads has been addressed directly within the provided design document excerpts.

---

If the user is new, they will register firstly it will be store in database, they will verifiy the profile.
If user is already signup, they will provide the email-Id and Password.
On the home page they will get the photos and videos, as well as the story page.
The post which is posted now, it will come at the top. User can follow or unfollow the person. User can get live. It’s all depend on them.
There will be setting, in which user can see there past story or the post which has been archive. User can unblock the person they can get verified account, after paying.

API Endpoints:

GET /posts/{post_id}: Retrieves details of a post, including the number of likes/dislikes.
POST /posts/{post_id}/like: Registers a like for the post by the authenticated user.
POST /posts/{post_id}/dislike: Registers a dislike for the post by the authenticated user.
DELETE /posts/{post_id}/like: Removes the like for the post by the authenticated user (if previously done).
DELETE /posts/{post_id}/dislike: Removes the dislike for the post by the authenticated user (if previously done).

}
8.5 Which Database we should select for Data storing?
It is essential to choose the right kind of database for our Instagram system, but which is the right choice — SQL or NoSQL? Our data is inherently relational, and we need an order for the data (posts should appear in chronological order) and no data loss even in case of failures (data durability). Moreover, in our case, we would benefit from relational queries like fetching the followers or images based on a user ID. Hence, SQL-based databases fulfill these requirements.

It allows us to load the content when the user scrolls and therefore save the bandwidth and focus on loading the content the user is currently viewing. It improves the latency to view or search a particular photo or video on Instagram.

Our system should allow us to upload, view, and search images and videos at a high level. To upload images and videos, we need to store them, and upon fetching, we need to retrieve the data from the storage. Moreover, the users should also be allowed to follow each other.

10. Scalability for Instagram System Design
Scalability refers to the ability of an organization (or a system, such as a computer network) to perform well under an increased or expanding workload. A system that scales well will be able to maintain or increase its level of performance even as it is tested by larger and larger operational demands.

We can add more servers to application service layers to make the scalability better and handle numerous requests from the clients. We can also increase the number of databases to store the growing users’ data.

Microservices – also known as the microservice architecture – is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of services that are:

Independently deployable
Loosely coupled

These requirements has been covered:
Scalability: We can add more servers to application service layers to make the scalability better and handle numerous requests from the clients. We can also increase the number of databases to store the growing users’ data.
Latency: The use of cache and CDNs have reduced the content fetching time.
Availability: We have made the system available to the users by using the storage and databases that are replicated across the globe.
Durability: We have persistent storage that maintains the backup of the data so any uploaded content (photos and videos) never gets lost.
Consistency: We have used storage like blob stores and databases to keep our data consistent globally.

3.1 Storage Per Day
Photos: 60 million photos/day * 3 MB = 180 TeraBytes / day
Videos: 35 million videos/day * 150 MB = 5250 TB / day
Total content size = 180 + 5250 = 5430 TB
The Total Space required for a Year:
5430 TB/day * 365 (days a year) = 1981950 TB = 1981.95 PetaBytes

3.2 Bandwidth Estimation
5430 TB/(24 * 60* 60) = 5430 TB/86400 sec ~= 62.84 GB/s ~= 502.8 Gbps
Incoming bandwidth ~= 502.8 Gbps
Let’s say the ratio of readers to writers is 100:1.
Required outgoing bandwidth ~= 100 * 502.8 Gbps ~= 50.28 Tbps

Use Case Diagram Instagram

In the above Diagram we have discussed about the use case diagram of Instagram:",115.31189179420471," The provided document does not specifically discuss or detail a method involving caching static data in relation to an Instagram-like system design. However, it mentions that ""we can add more servers to application service layers"" for scalability and handling numerous requests from clients – which indirectly supports the concept of using cache services if needed (though this aspect is not directly discussed).

Caching strategies are critical in systems like Instagram because they help reduce latency, improve user experience by providing faster load times, especially important when dealing with high volumes of data such as images and videos. Although static caching might be a part of an overall system design that includes cache layers for frequently accessed content (like thumbnails or popular posts), the document seems to focus more on scalability through additional servers and databases rather than explicitly addressing aspects like CDNs, which often serve this purpose in real-world applications.

In typical architectures involving platforms similar to Instagram where caching is essential:

1. Static content (like thumbnails or previews of images/videos) would indeed be cached since they are less frequently updated and do not change as much over time, allowing for quicker retrieval without hitting the primary storage directly each time a user accesses them. This reduces load times significantly because these elements don't need to originate from live streaming sources like videos or frequent uploads of new content (which would be dynamic).
   
2. Data replication and distributed databases are mentioned, which do contribute towards availability but not directly as cache layers for static data storage across geographical locations – though this approach also inherently provides quicker access to cached versions due to proximity to the user's location when appropriate failover or load-balancing mechanisms come into play.

For a system like Instagram, implementing proper caching strategies is critical in handling large volumes of data efficiently while ensuring high availability and performance for end-users around the world. Even though these details are not explicitly discussed within your document's context, it would be advisable to incorporate such considerations as part of a comprehensive system design if aiming at paralleling industry standards like those set by Instagram itself.",48.681750774383545,0,"[Document(page_content='url = ""https://photoslibrary.googleapis.com/v1/mediaItems:search""\nheaders = {\n    ""Authorization"": ""Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN""  # Replace with your access token\n}\ndata = {\n    ""filters"": {\n        ""mediaTypes"": [""PHOTO"", ""VIDEO""]  # Search for both photos and videos\n    }\n}\nresponse = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=data)\n \nif response.status_code == 200:\n    results = response.json()\n    # Process the search results\nelse:\n    print(""Error:"", response.status_code, response.text)\n8.

We need the following tables to store our data:",128.0769305229187," No, there is no specific mention about data compression in transit within this context or design documentation provided so far. However, it's worth noting that Instagram and other modern web services often employ various techniques to optimize network usage without explicit reference during routine operations description like caching responses close to the user’s device (using CDN), serving assets over HTTP/2 for better efficiency in loading resources from a single location or using protocol optimizations such as gRPC instead of RESTful APIs where appropriate. 

These techniques can help reduce unnecessary data transmission by only sending changes since the last request, and not reloading entire pages when minor updates occur – all while maintaining user experience quality and system responsiveness under load conditions without needing to explicitly mention them in design documents at a high level overview phase or even during initial development phases unless network efficiency is specifically being addressed as an additional requirement.

If your project requires explicit considerations for data transmission, then you would typically include mechanisms like gzip compression within the HTTP headers of responses and requesting clients to decompress them accordingly using built-in browser capabilities (e.g., `Accept-Encoding: gzip` in requests). It's also common practice when working with large files or images that need sharing over networks, Instagram might employ more complex data deduplication strategies across the distributed system for efficiency reasons without necessarily requiring explicit mention during a high level design phase unless it is identified as an essential part of your project scope.",39.97863459587097,0,"[Document(page_content='3.1 Storage Per Day\nPhotos: 60 million photos/day * 3 MB = 180 TeraBytes / day\nVideos: 35 million videos/day * 150 MB = 5250 TB / day\nTotal content size = 180 + 5250 = 5430 TB\nThe Total Space required for a Year:\n5430 TB/day * 365 (days a year) = 1981950 TB = 1981.95 PetaBytes\n\n3.2 Bandwidth Estimation\n5430 TB/(24 * 60* 60) = 5430 TB/86400 sec ~= 62.84 GB/s ~= 502.8 Gbps\nIncoming bandwidth ~= 502.8 Gbps\nLet’s say the ratio of readers to writers is 100:1.\nRequired outgoing bandwidth ~= 100 * 502.8 Gbps ~= 50.28 Tbps\n\n4.

However, as a best practice for modern web services and applications handling sensitive user information (such as personal photos), ensuring that appropriate security measures are in place—including encrypting personally identifiable information at rest when necessary according to privacy regulations such as GDPR is crucial.

Typically, encryption of critical data elements like usernames or email addresses might be employed within user profiles and sessions for enhanced protection against unautneries targeted attacks (e.g., credential stuffing). However, actual Instagram's security specifications are not detailed in this document summary provided by you.

When designing a system like the one described herein or any similar social platform that handles personal data and media sharing, ensuring end-to-end encryption (where appropriate), secure authentication mechanisms, and adherence to privacy laws is paramount for protecting user information both in transit and at rest.

These requirements has been covered:
Scalability: We can add more servers to application service layers to make the scalability better and handle numerous requests from the clients. We can also increase the number of databases to store the growing users’ data.
Latency: The use of cache and CDNs have reduced the content fetching time.
Availability: We have made the system available to the users by using the storage and databases that are replicated across the globe.
Durability: We have persistent storage that maintains the backup of the data so any uploaded content (photos and videos) never gets lost.
Consistency: We have used storage like blob stores and databases to keep our data consistent globally.

Generate news feed: The users can view the news feed consisting of the photos and videos (in chronological order) from all the users they follow.
2.2 Non-Functional requirements for Instagram System Design
Scalability: The system should be scalable to handle millions of users in terms of computational resources and storage.
Latency: The latency to generate a news feed should be low.
Availability: The system should be highly available.",113.59221625328064," No, the provided document does not explicitly state that a service mesh would only be used when necessary in Instagram's design approach. However, it mentions implementing features like load balancing and circuit breaking to improve scalability and reliability which are key aspects typically managed with a Service Mesh architecture as part of Kubernetes-based deployments or microservices platforms (like Istio). The use of such an infrastructure is generally considered standard for handling the complexities associated with modern cloud environments, ensuring secure communication between services.

Here's how these concepts relate to Instagram’s design:
1. Scalability - To ensure that Instagram can handle a large number of users and requests effectively as it grows in popularity, scalable infrastructure is essential. A Service Mesh could be utilized here for efficient load distribution across services. This wouldn't necessarily mean using the mesh only when needed but providing foundational mechanisms to manage scaling proactively or reactively based on demand without compromising service availability and performance.
2. Latency - By optimizing routing, caching content closer to users via Content Delivery Networks (CDN), and implementing efficient load balancing with a Service Mesh if using containerized microservices architectures, Instagram can minimize latency in accessing its resources globally for an improved user experience when uploading or viewing media.
3. Availability - Ensuring high availability is critical to keep the platform accessible around the clock without interruptions. This involves replicating data across multiple regions using persistent storage solutions and databases, which are part of a broader infrastructure strategy that may also include Service Mesh for maintaining service-to-service communication reliability through circuit breakers in case of failures or performance bottlenecks.
4. Durability - Persistent backup mechanisms ensure data durability by protecting against accidental loss due to system failure, which might be facilitated by using robust database systems that could potentially integrate with a Service Mesh for service-level monitoring and resilience strategies like retries or fallbacks in case of transient failures.
5. Consistency - Global data consistency is essential when ensuring users see the latest version of their content across different regions. This might involve synchronous replication within a Service Mesh setup, which offers fine-grained control and could be configured according to Instagram's requirements for eventual or strong consistency models while managing trade-offs related to latency in real-time applications like social media platforms.

In conclusion, the use of service meshes typically aligns with modern cloud architectures that manage complex interactions between microservices and ensure robustness through patterns such as circuit breaking which Instagram may employ within its infrastructure regardless if it's explicitly stated to be needed only in exceptional circumstances or for specific functionalities.",60.307016134262085,0,"[Document(page_content='Feed Generation adjusts based on changed relationships.\nUser monitors activity:\nClient checks notifications feed.\nNotifications provide updates on relevant events.\nKey Design Considerations:', metadata={'id': 'documentsFromText/Instagram/content.txt:None:14', 'source': 'documentsFromText/Instagram/content.txt'}), Document(page_content='3.1 Storage Per Day\nPhotos: 60 million photos/day * 3 MB = 180 TeraBytes / day\nVideos: 35 million videos/day * 150 MB = 5250 TB / day\nTotal content size = 180 + 5250 = 5430 TB\nThe Total Space required for a Year:\n5430 TB/day * 365 (days a year) = 1981950 TB = 1981.95 PetaBytes\n\n3.2 Bandwidth Estimation\n5430 TB/(24 * 60* 60) = 5430 TB/86400 sec ~= 62.84 GB/s ~= 502.8 Gbps\nIncoming bandwidth ~= 502.8 Gbps\nLet’s say the ratio of readers to writers is 100:1.\nRequired outgoing bandwidth ~= 100 * 502.8 Gbps ~= 50.28 Tbps\n\n4.

It often helps in scaling as it reduces server load since there's no need for session persistence across multiple service instances or servers.

In a microservices architecture like Instagram could benefit from being stateless if possible because each instance can handle any request without maintaining client sessions, which makes horizontal scaling easier and more efficient due to less dependency on shared state management mechanisms (like Redis). Statelessness in such architectures typically requires the use of external services for session persistence or using tokens that encapsulate session states.

However, Instagram's design may need some form of client-side state handling because users interact with their feed and history continuously as they browse through posts (like likes/dislikes). The statelessness could apply to how the system communicates between services rather than maintaining a user’s session or personalized data at each Instagram service endpoint.

To implement state management in this context, one might consider using tokens like JWT (JSON Web Tokens) wherein signed information about users is carried with every request for certain endpoints that require authentication and authorization checks to be made without relying on server-side session storage mechanisms. This approach would help Instagram's system handle user state across microservice calls efficiently while still being stateless in the broader sense of its architecture, ensuring scalability by reducing reliance on shared resources for maintaining sessions or context between requests and responses within services themselves (except where needed).",42.075671911239624,0,"[Document(page_content='Feed Generation adjusts based on changed relationships.\nUser monitors activity:\nClient checks notifications feed.\nNotifications provide updates on relevant events.\nKey Design Considerations:', metadata={'id': 'documentsFromText/Instagram/content.txt:None:14', 'source': 'documentsFromText/Instagram/content.txt'}), Document(page_content='url = ""https://photoslibrary.googleapis.com/v1/mediaItems:search""\nheaders = {\n    ""Authorization"": ""Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN""  # Replace with your access token\n}\ndata = {\n    ""filters"": {\n        ""mediaTypes"": [""PHOTO"", ""VIDEO""]  # Search for both photos and videos\n    }\n}\nresponse = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=data)\n \nif response.status_code == 200:\n    results = response.json()\n    # Process the search results\nelse:\n    print(""Error:"", response.status_code, response.text)\n8.

Scalability refers to the ability of an organization (or a system, such as a computer network) to perform well under an increased or expanding workload. A system that scales well will be able to maintain or increase its level of performance even as it is tested by larger and larger operational demands.

We can add more servers to application service layers to make the scalability better and handle numerous requests from the clients. We can also increase the number of databases to store the growing users’ data.

These requirements has been covered:
Scalability: We can add more servers to application service layers to make the scalability better and handle numerous requests from the clients. We can also increase the number of databases to store the growing users’ data.
Latency: The use of cache and CDNs have reduced the content fetching time.
Availability: We have made the system available to the users by using the storage and databases that are replicated across the globe.
Durability: We have persistent storage that maintains the backup of the data so any uploaded content (photos and videos) never gets lost.
Consistency: We have used storage like blob stores and databases to keep our data consistent globally.",124.36628079414368," No, the provided document does not specifically address the optimization of the sizes of AI or ML (Artificial Intelligence or Machine Learning) models for Instagram's system design. Optimizing model sizes is an important consideration in a social media platform to reduce latency and improve user experience when accessing personalized content such as recommended feeds, but it isn't covered directly within the outlined aspects of scalability, availability, consistency, durability, or low-latency access.

If optimizing AI/ML model sizes is a concern for Instagram (or any similar platform), strategies might include techniques like pruning neural networks to remove redundant parameters, using knowledge distillation where a smaller ""student"" network learns from an already trained larger ""teacher"" network's outputs, quantization which reduces the precision of the numbers used in calculations without losing significant accuracy (thus requiring less data), and employing efficient algorithms specifically designed for mobile or edge devices.

Additionally, maintaining AI/ML model sizes could involve periodically reviewing deployed models to identify opportunities for reducing size while still meeting performance objectives—a process known as continual optimization. This would be crucial if Instagram plans on utilizing sophisticated algorithms that require a trade-off between real-time responsiveness and computational load, such as facial recognition or sentiment analysis features in posts and comments.

The microservice architecture enables an organization to deliver large, complex applications rapidly, frequently, reliably and sustainably – a necessity for competing and winning in today’s world.",122.79841184616089," The provided document does not explicitly discuss the implementation or use of artificial intelligence (AI) or machine learning (ML) models to reduce energy consumption without compromising on performance for an Instagram-like system. However, implementing such features would generally involve optimizing server operations and employing intelligent caching mechanisms that predictively load user feeds based on activity patterns while consuming minimal resources during idle times.

In modern cloud infrastructures like Google Cloud Platform or Amazon Web Services (AWS), energy-efficient computing can be facilitated through the use of specialized services designed to optimize for both cost and performance, such as AWS Lambda functions that run code in response to events without provisioning or managing servers. Similar principles could potentially apply within a microservice architecture on Instagram by using serverless technologies where possible.

Moreover, employing AI/ML models can help with image recognition tasks (e.g., identifying and organizing content) which would traditionally be energy-intensive if done in real time but could instead run asynchronously or at lower resolutions when not needed immediately by the user interface for quick access to relevant media feeds based on interests, behaviors, or tags used within their posts. This way, a balance can potentially be struck between performance and efficiency while maintaining an engaging experience tailored to individual users' activities without unnecessarily consuming energy during idle periods of interaction with Instagram services.",38.290350914001465,0,"[Document(page_content='Feed Generation adjusts based on changed relationships.\nUser monitors activity:\nClient checks notifications feed.\nNotifications provide updates on relevant events.\nKey Design Considerations:', metadata={'id': 'documentsFromText/Instagram/content.txt:None:14', 'source': 'documentsFromText/Instagram/content.txt'}), Document(page_content='3.1 Storage Per Day\nPhotos: 60 million photos/day * 3 MB = 180 TeraBytes / day\nVideos: 35 million videos/day * 150 MB = 5250 TB / day\nTotal content size = 180 + 5250 = 5430 TB\nThe Total Space required for a Year:\n5430 TB/day * 365 (days a year) = 1981950 TB = 1981.95 PetaBytes\n\n3.2 Bandwidth Estimation\n5430 TB/(24 * 60* 60) = 5430 TB/86400 sec ~= 62.84 GB/s ~= 502.8 Gbps\nIncoming bandwidth ~= 502.8 Gbps\nLet’s say the ratio of readers to writers is 100:1.\nRequired outgoing bandwidth ~= 100 * 502.8 Gbps ~= 50.28 Tbps\n\n4.

8. Database Design for Instagram Database Design
We need the following tables to store our data:

---

3.1 Storage Per Day
Photos: 60 million photos/day * 3 MB = 180 TeraBytes / day
Videos: 35 million videos/day * 150 MB = 5250 TB / day
Total content size = 180 + 5250 = 5430 TB
The Total Space required for a Year:
5430 TB/day * 365 (days a year) = 1981950 TB = 1981.95 PetaBytes

3.2 Bandwidth Estimation
5430 TB/(24 * 60* 60) = 5430 TB/86400 sec ~= 62.84 GB/s ~= 502.8 Gbps
Incoming bandwidth ~= 502.8 Gbps
Let’s say the ratio of readers to writers is 100:1.
Required outgoing bandwidth ~= 100 * 502.8 Gbps ~= 50.28 Tbps

While SQL databases are mentioned, they would typically be used alongside efficient mechanisms like columnar storage which can benefit from using parquet or similar binary format that reduces I/O and improves parallelization during read-heavy operations such as scanning through a user's feeds for images or videos. This is particularly relevant when dealing with high volumes of data, ensuring performance while maintaining the relational structure needed for complex queries within your Instagram system design:

---
5 Use Case Diagram and Data Storage Decisions - Parquet Consideration (Continuation)
When deciding on a database that fits well into our microservices architecture — which would be SQL due to its relationally structured data — we should also consider the efficiency of storing large datasets. For instance, using columnar storage formats like Parquet or ORC can offer significant performance benefits for read-heavy operations common in social media platforms:

The text you provided focuses primarily on the high-level and low-level design concepts for an Instagram system using microservices architecture that emphasizes scalability and efficiency within cloud data storage options like SQL databases, as well as detailed component interactions but does not address AI model training strategies or environmental considerations in their deployment.

If you are interested in sustainable practices when it comes to deploying applications such as Instagram with microservices architecture on the cloud, including aspects of carbon footprint and energy efficiency during data processing tasks like machine learning (ML) computations, that would typically involve choosing a cloud provider known for its commitment to green computing initiatives. Cloud service providers may offer resources optimized for AI workloads in regions where renewable energy usage is high or provide tools that help measure the environmental impact of using their services.

To reduce carbon footprint when deploying ML models, one might consider:

1. Selecting cloud services and infrastructure with a clear commitment to sustainability (e.g., Azure has regions powered by renewable energy sources).
2. Optimizing algorithms for efficiency so that less computational resource is required which in turn reduces electricity usage.
3. Implementing cool-down or scaling down strategies during non-peak hours when possible to save on energy consumption while maintaining performance needs.
4. Regularly reviewing and adjusting the hardware resources allocated for specific workloads, ensuring that you are not overprovisioned but still meeting demand.
5. Leveraging cloud provider services designed with sustainability in mind (e.g., AWS's Sustainable Compute-in-Use service).

8. Database Design for Instagram Database Design
We need the following tables to store our data:

---

If the user is new, they will register firstly it will be store in database, they will verifiy the profile.
If user is already signup, they will provide the email-Id and Password.
On the home page they will get the photos and videos, as well as the story page.
The post which is posted now, it will come at the top. User can follow or unfollow the person. User can get live. It’s all depend on them.
There will be setting, in which user can see there past story or the post which has been archive. User can unblock the person they can get verified account, after paying.
5. Low-Level Design(LLD) for Instagram System Design
design-instagram-lld

Here’s a breakdown of the key components and interactions for Instagram’s low-level design:

---

3.1 Storage Per Day
Photos: 60 million photos/day * 3 MB = 180 TeraBytes / day
Videos: 35 million videos/day * 150 MB = 5250 TB / day
Total content size = 180 + 5250 = 5430 TB
The Total Space required for a Year:
5430 TB/day * 365 (days a year) = 1981950 TB = 1981.95 PetaBytes

3.2 Bandwidth Estimation
5430 TB/(24 * 60* 60) = 5430 TB/86400 sec ~= 62.84 GB/s ~= 502.8 Gbps
Incoming bandwidth ~= 502.8 Gbps
Let’s say the ratio of readers to writers is 100:1.
Required outgoing bandwidth ~= 100 * 502.8 Gbps ~= 50.28 Tbps

8.5 Which Database we should select for Data storing?
It is essential to choose the right kind of database for our Instagram system, but which is the right choice — SQL or NoSQL? Our data is inherently relational, and we need an order for the data (posts should appear in chronological order) and no data loss even in case of failures (data durability). Moreover, in our case, we would benefit from relational queries like fetching the followers or images based on a user ID. Hence, SQL-based databases fulfill these requirements.

It allows us to load the content when the user scrolls and therefore save the bandwidth and focus on loading the content the user is currently viewing. It improves the latency to view or search a particular photo or video on Instagram.
6. High-Level Design(HLD) for Instagram System Design
Our system should allow us to upload, view, and search images and videos at a high level. To upload images and videos, we need to store them, and upon fetching, we need to retrieve the data from the storage. Moreover, the users should also be allowed to follow each other.

10. Scalability for Instagram System Design
Scalability refers to the ability of an organization (or a system, such as a computer network) to perform well under an increased or expanding workload. A system that scales well will be able to maintain or increase its level of performance even as it is tested by larger and larger operational demands.

We can add more servers to application service layers to make the scalability better and handle numerous requests from the clients. We can also increase the number of databases to store the growing users’ data.

---

Microservices – also known as the microservice architecture – is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of services that are:

Independently deployable
Loosely coupled
Organized around business capabilities
Owned by a small team
The microservice architecture enables an organization to deliver large, complex applications rapidly, frequently, reliably and sustainably – a necessity for competing and winning in today’s world.

API Endpoints:

GET /posts/{post_id}: Retrieves details of a post, including the number of likes/dislikes.
POST /posts/{post_id}/like: Registers a like for the post by the authenticated user.
POST /posts/{post_id}/dislike: Registers a dislike for the post by the authenticated user.
DELETE /posts/{post_id}/like: Removes the like for the post by the authenticated user (if previously done).
DELETE /posts/{post_id}/dislike: Removes the dislike for the post by the authenticated user (if previously done).

These requirements has been covered:
Scalability: We can add more servers to application service layers to make the scalability better and handle numerous requests from the clients. We can also increase the number of databases to store the growing users’ data.
Latency: The use of cache and CDNs have reduced the content fetching time.
Availability: We have made the system available to the users by using the storage and databases that are replicated across the globe.
Durability: We have persistent storage that maintains the backup of the data so any uploaded content (photos and videos) never gets lost.
Consistency: We have used storage like blob stores and databases to keep our data consistent globally.",120.83756852149963," The provided document does not specifically discuss choosing between CPU-based instances (e.g., c5, m4) versus GPU-accelerated ones like p3 for Instagram's system design in detail. However, it emphasizes scalability and performance aspects essential to supporting the high user base of social media platforms such as Instagram:

```plaintext
Scalability refers to the ability of an organization (or a system, such as a computer network) to perform well under increased or expanding workload conditions… The microservice architecture enables rapid development delivery and frequent updates.
```
Given these points in mind here are some general considerations when choosing between CPU-based instances versus GPU accelerated ones for the Instagram System: 
1. Compute Intensive Tasks – If your system relies heavily on compute-intensive tasks like realtime video processing, machine learning or complex data analytics then a high performance computing instance with an integrated GPU (like p3) may be beneficial due to its ability to perform parallel computations faster than traditional CPU instances.
2. Scalability – If your system is expected to scale horizontally by adding more servers as demand increases, consider using the AWS EC2 Spot Instances which allow you to bid for unused capacity and get it at a lower cost compared with On-Demand pricing models (though there's always some risk of losing these resources).
3. Prices – Compare costs between CPU instances like c5 or m4 versus GPU accelerated ones such as p3 based on your system’s requirements to find the most economical solution while still meeting performance expectations. 
```plaintext
You may want to consider using a combination of compute types: Use cheaper, more general-purpose CPU instances for stateless services like web servers and use faster GPU accelerated nodes (like p3) where possible on dedicated tasks requiring parallel computation or heavy graphics processing such as video rendering. 
```
Remember that choosing the right hardware/VM instance type also depends heavily upon your software architecture, network setup & database requirements which are not discussed in this document. In general terms though, Instagram would likely benefit more from using GPU-accelerated instances due to their ability to handle intensive graphics and compute tasks (like photo or video processing). 
```plaintext
Keep an eye on emerging hardware technologies like Neuromorphic chips that promise higher efficiency for specific AI workloads. They are still experimental but may offer exciting future opportunities! Also remember, cloud provider's pricing and instance types evolve regularly so it’s wise to stay updated with the latest options available at your chosen service providers (like AWS).
