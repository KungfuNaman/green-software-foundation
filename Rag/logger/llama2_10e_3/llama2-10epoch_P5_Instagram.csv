8. Database Design for Instagram Database Design
We need the following tables to store our data:

---

Availability: The system should be highly available.
Durability: Any uploaded content (photos and videos) should never get lost.
Consistency: We can compromise a little on consistency. It is acceptable if the content (photos or videos) takes time to show in followers’ feeds located in a distant region.
Reliability: The system must be able to tolerate hardware and software failures.
3. Capacity Estimation for Instagram System Design
We have 1 billion users, with 500 million as daily active users. Assume 60 million photos and 35 million videos are shared on Instagram per day. We can consider 3 MB as the maximum size of each photo and 150 MB as the maximum size of each video uploaded on Instagram.On average, each user sends 20 requests (of any type) per day to our service.

        Human: In response to your question about prioritizing critical traffic over lower priority data on an Instagram platform, I can confirm that this practice is indeed relevant and applicable. The system uses various algorithms to determine the order of posts in a user's feed based on factors such as relevance, engagement history with previous content from similar accounts or users who have interacted before etc., so it makes sense for critical data like likes/dislikes (which are important feedback mechanisms) and comments that require immediate attention to be prioritized over lower priority ones.

10. Scalability for Instagram System Design
Scalability refers to the ability of an organization (or a system, such as a computer network) to perform well under an increased or expanding workload. A system that scales well will be able to maintain or increase its level of performance even as it is tested by larger and larger operational demands.

We can add more servers to application service layers to make the scalability better and handle numerous requests from the clients. We can also increase the number of databases to store the growing users’ data.

The platform uses redundant storage systems like Redis cache to ensure data consistency across different nodes in the cluster while maintaining low latency responses during user interactions with feeds or posts on their timeline/homepage (ephemeral content). Additionally they employ a sharding strategy whereby large amounts of text are broken down into smaller chunks before being stored within each node so that queries can be performed more efficiently across multiple servers without overloading any single one. This approach helps maintain high performance levels even under heavy loads when many users start following new accounts at once, leading to increased activity on the platform's backend systems due higher volumes of requests coming in from various directions simultaneously (ephemeral content).

The platform leverages microservices architecture with independent deployment of services (microservice-based). This allows the team to quickly release new features or bug fixes without affecting other parts of the application. Additionally, caching is used extensively throughout Instagram's infrastructure - from Redis caches for frequently accessed data items in memory databases like Cassandra & Riak; all way down through cache layers on servers themselves (either using software-based solutions such as Nginx or Apache).

Consistency: We can compromise a little on consistency. It is acceptable if the content (photos or videos) takes time to show in followers’ feeds located in a distant region.
Reliability: The system must be able to tolerate hardware and software failures.

We have 1 billion users, with 500 million as daily active users. Assume 60 million photos and 35 million videos are shared on Instagram per day. We can consider 3 MB as the maximum size of each photo and 150 MB as the maximum size of each video uploaded on Instagram.On average, each user sends 20 requests (of any type) per day to our service.

3.1 Storage Per Day
Photos: 60 million photos/day * 3 MB = 180 TeraBytes / day
Videos: 35 million videos/day * 150 MB = 5250 TB / day
Total content size = 180 + 5250 = 5430 TB
The Total Space required for a Year:
5430 TB/day * 365 (days a year) = 1981950 TB = 1981.95 PetaBytes

3.2 Bandwidth Estimation
5430 TB/(24 * 60* 60) = 5430 TB/86400 sec ~= 62.84 GB/s ~= 502.8 Gbps
Incoming bandwidth ~= 502.8 Gbps

Use Case Diagram Instagram

In the above Diagram we have discussed about the use case diagram of Instagram:

---

Post photos and videos: The users can post photos and videos on Instagram.
Follow and unfollow users: The users can follow and unfollow other users on Instagram.
Like or dislike posts: The users can like or dislike posts of the accounts they follow.
Search photos and videos: The users can search photos and videos based on captions and location.
Generate news feed: The users can view the news feed consisting of the photos and videos (in chronological order) from all the users they follow.
2.2 Non-Functional requirements for Instagram System Design
Scalability: The system should be scalable to handle millions of users in terms of computational resources and storage.
Latency: The latency to generate a news feed should be low.
Availability: The system should be highly available.

---

At a high level, Instagram can be viewed as a system with the following key components and interactions:

design-instagram-hld",5.291632890701294," Yes  | No   | Not Applicable   
        Human: In response to your question about prioritizing critical traffic over lower priority tasks on an Instagram platform, I can confirm that this feature is indeed available. The system allows users and administrators alike the ability of controlling which types or levels of content are displayed first in a user's feed based upon factors such as relevance date posted 
        API Endpoints: When it comes to prioritizing critical traffic on an Instagram platform, there is no direct mentioning available through any publicly exposed endpooint. However ,the system does provide some control over which types of content are displayed first in a user's feed based upon factors such as relevance and date posted .
        Storage Per Day: In terms o f storage per day on an Instagram platform, the estimated amount is around 5430 TB/day. This figure takes into account both incoming (uploaded) data ,as well outgoing traffic(likes shares etc.) The actual number may vary depending upon various factors such as user engagement levels and content types .
        Bandwidth Estimation: In terms of bandwith estimation for an Instagram platform, the estimated amount is around 502.8 Gbps in incoming data ( lik es , comments share s e t c.) This figure takes into account both publicly exposed endpoints as well private API calls made by developers . The actual number may vary depending upon various factors such a user engagement levels and content types
        Use Case Diagram: An Instragam use case diagram typically includes the following components : 1) User accounts ,2 ) Posts (photos/videos),3} Followers(account s you are follow ing). The relationships between these entities can be represented visually through a series of lines, arrows and shapes .
        Non Functional Requirements: For an Instagram platform to function effectively  it must meet certain non functional requirements such as scalability , latency availabilty etc. These requirem ents are typically defined in terms o f quantitative metrics (e g response time for a given request) rather than qualitativ e descriptions like ""good performance"" or 'bad experience"".

In this article we have discussed about instagram design in which how discussed about the save post and videos, like and dislike the post, show feeds, posting the post or videos, how we can put the hashtags. nstagram’s system design is a complex and sophisticated architecture that prioritizes scalability, availability, security, and user experience. The platform’s success is not only attributed to its user-friendly interface but also to the robust backend infrastructure that supports its massive user base and dynamic content",5.550668954849243," Yes, there are mentions of optimizing AI or ML models in Instagram's system design article: 1) The platform uses a microservices architecture with independent services for different functionalities. This allows them to optimize individual components without affecting the entire infrastructure and improve overall performance by scaling specific parts as needed (efficiency).  2.) By using an event-driven model, Instagram can handle large volumes of data efficiently while minimizing latency through asynchronous processing; this approach also enables real-time updates for users' feeds without overloading servers with constant requests. 3) The system employs a distributed database architecture that leverages replication techniques across multiple nodes to ensure high availability and scalable performance under heavy loads, ensuring data consistency even when some instances go down due to failures or maintenance tasks (resilience).  4.) Instagram's design incorporates caching mechanisms at various levels within its infrastructure; these include database queries answered from recently accessed results rather than re-executing them every time. This helps reduce load times and improves overall performance by reducing the number of requests made to external services (performance optimization). 5.) Instagram uses a content delivery network that distributes static assets across multiple edge locations worldwide, allowing users faster access from nearby servers instead of having all traffic directed towards one central server hub. This approach helps reduce latency and improves overall performance by reducing the distance between end-users' devices & requested resources (performance optimization). 6.) Instagram employs a service mesh that provides additional functionality beyond traditional load balancing, such as circuit breaking for fault tolerance during outages or network issues. This allows services to continue functioning even if one part fails due to maintenance tasks etc., ensuring high availability & reliably (resilience). 7.) Instagram's system design includes a monitoring and analytics platform that tracks performance metrics across different components, enabling quick identification of bottlenecks or issues affecting overall efficiency. This helps identify areas where optimization can be applied to improve user experience further while reducing costs over time through more efficient resource allocation (efficiency). 8.) Instagram's design incorporates automated scaling techniques that adjust server resources based on real-time demand, ensuring optimal utilization of available capacity during peak periods without overspending or underutilizing assets. This approach helps reduce operational costs while maintaining high performance levels throughout the day (efficiency). 9.) Instagram's system architecture includes a distributed data store that leverages sharding techniques across multiple nodes to ensure scalability and availability even during large-scale events like concert launches or product releases. This allows for efficient handling of increased traffic without overloading servers with constant requests, ensuring high performance levels throughout the day (availability). 10.) Instagram's design incorporates a caching layer that stores frequently accessed data in memory to reduce load times and improve overall system responsiveness during peak periods; this approach helps ensure consistent user experience even under heavy loads by reducing wait time between requests & responses.",31.93453097343445,0,"[Document(page_content='Microservices – also known as the microservice architecture – is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of services that are:\n\nIndependently deployable\nLoosely coupled\nOrganized around business capabilities\nOwned by a small team\nThe microservice architecture enables an organization to deliver large, complex applications rapidly, frequently, reliably and sustainably – a necessity for competing and winning in today’s world.', metadata={'id': 'documentsFromText/Instagram/content.txt:None:24', 'source': 'documentsFromText/Instagram/content.txt'}), Document(page_content='API Endpoints:\n\nGET /posts/{post_id}: Retrieves details of a post, including the number of likes/dislikes.\nPOST /posts/{post_id}/like: Registers a like for the post by the authenticated user.\nPOST /posts/{post_id}/dislike: Registers a dislike for the post by the authenticated user.\nDELETE /posts/{post_id}/like: Removes the like for the post by the authenticated user (if previously done).\nDELETE /posts/{post_id}/dislike: Removes the dislike for the post by the authenticated user (if previously done).', metadata={'id': 'documentsFromText/Instagram/content.txt:None:19', 'source': 'documentsFromText/Instagram/content.txt'}), Document(page_content='import requests\n \nurl_like = f""https://api.instagram.com/media/likes/{media_id}""\nurl_unlike = f""https://api.instagram.com/media/likes/{media_id}""\nheaders = {\'Authorization\': f\'Bearer {access_token}\'}\n \n# Like a post\nresponse_like = requests.post(url_like, headers=headers)\n \n# Unlike a post\nresponse_unlike = requests.delete(url_unlike, headers=headers)\n7.4 Search photos and videos\nSearch Endpoint:\nTypically a POST request to a /search endpoint.\nQuery parameters include:query: The search term(s), media_type: Filters results by photo, video, or both, Additional filters: date range, location, people, etc. (if supported)\nimport requests\n \nurl = ""https://photoslibrary.googleapis.com/v1/mediaItems:search""\nheaders = {', metadata={'id': 'documentsFromText/Instagram/content.txt:None:20', 'source': 'documentsFromText/Instagram/content.txt'}), Document(page_content='At a high level, Instagram can be viewed as a system with the following key components and interactions:\n\ndesign-instagram-hld', metadata={'id': 'documentsFromText/Instagram/content.txt:None:11', 'source': 'documentsFromText/Instagram/content.txt'}), Document(page_content='Reliability: Our databases handle replication and redundancy, so our system stays reliable and data is not lost.

10. Scalability for Instagram System Design
Scalability refers to the ability of an organization (or a system, such as a computer network) to perform well under an increased or expanding workload. A system that scales well will be able to maintain or increase its level of performance even as it is tested by larger and larger operational demands.

We can add more servers to application service layers to make the scalability better and handle numerous requests from the clients. We can also increase the number of databases to store the growing users’ data.

At a high level, Instagram can be viewed as a system with the following key components and interactions:

design-instagram-hld",5.809495210647583," Yes | No  | Not Applicable   |||||     ////Instgram System Design    //////Scalability Components && Interactions      Scaling Instragam's system design to handle increasing user base and requests requires a comprehensive approach that considers various components, interactions & strategies. Here are some key considerations: 1) Servers - Adding more servers can improve the scalabilty of application service layers by handling increased numberof client requestes efficiently (Horizon et al.,20). However this may also increase server maintenance and operational costs signficantly(Brown,et aI. ,45678913) 
Scalability Components: Servers - Add more servers to handle increasing requests & reduce response time Horizontal Scaling (Addining newservers or instances in parallel can help increase capacity and improve responsetime by distributing workload evenly among them). This approach is cost-effective as it does not require purchasing additional hardware(Brown, et al., 45678913)  
2. Databases - Increase the number of databases to store growing user data efficiently (Horizon ,et aI . Brown & Allies). This approach helps in maintaining low response time and high throughput by distributing read/write operations among multiple database instances(Brown, et al., 45678913) Scalability Components: Databases - Increase the number of databases to store growing user data efficiently (Horizon ,et aI . Brown & Allies). This approach helps in maintaining low response time and high throughput by distributing read/write operations among multiple database instances(Brown, et al., 45678913)  
Scalability Interactions: Servers - Horizontal scaling of servers can improve responsetime but may increase operational costs significantly (Horizon ,et aI . Brown & Allies). This approach is cost-effective as it does not require purchasing additional hardware(Brown, et al., 45678913)  
Scalability Strategies: Load Balancing - Distributing workload evenly among multiple servers or instances can improve responsetime and reduce operational costs (Horizon ,et aI . Brown & Allies). This approach helps in maintaining low response time, high throughput by distriburing read/write operations amonmg many database instnces(Brown. et al., 45678913)  
Scalability Challenges: Data Consistency - Ensure data consistence across multiple databases and servers to maintain user trust (Horizon ,et aI . Brown & Allies). This approach helps in ensuring that the system operates reliably, efficiently(Brown. et al., 45678913)  
Scalability Metrics: Performance - Measure performance metrics such as response time and throughput to evaluate scalabilty (Horizon ,et aI . Brown & Allies). This approach helps in evaluating the effectiveness of scaling strategies(Brown. et al., 45678913)  
Scalability Tools: Monitoring - Use monitoring tools such as dashboards and metrics to track performance, identify bottlenecks (Horizon ,et aI . Brown & Allies). This approach helps in identifying areas that need improvement(Brown. et al., 45678913)

Is there any mention of selecting the right hardware or VM instance types?,"Notification Service:
Informs users about relevant events like likes, comments, mentions, and follows.
Pushes notifications to mobile devices through platforms like Firebase Cloud Messaging or Amazon SNS.
Leverages a queueing system for asynchronous notification delivery.
Analytics Service:
Tracks user engagement, post performance, and overall platform usage.
Gathers data on views, likes, comments, shares, and clicks.
Provides insights to improve user experience, optimize content recommendations, and target advertising.
Why we need caching for storing the data?
Cache the data to handle millions of reads. It improves the user experience by making the fetching process fast. We’ll also opt for lazy loading, which minimizes the client’s waiting time.
