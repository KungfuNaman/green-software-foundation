This practice is essential for maintaining a sustainable system, ensuring that only necessary files are stored on the server or cloud storage services (CSP). By removing unnecessary data models from production environments when they're no longer needed can help improve performance by avoiding excessive load times associated with loading multiple large assets at once. Additionally it helps reduce costs in terms of bandwidth usage since fewer items need to be transferred across networks during deployment or updates processes, resulting overall cost savings over time due these practices being implemented correctly throughout all systems involved within an organization's ecosystem

User A and user B create a communication channel with the chat server.
User A sends a message to the chat server.
Upon receiving the message, the chat server acknowledges back to user A.
The chat server sends the message to user B and stores the message in the database if the receiver’s status is offline.
User B sends an acknowledgment to the chat server.
The chat server notifies user A that the message has been successfully delivered.
When user B reads the message, the application notifies the chat server.
The chat server notifies user A that user B has read the message.

Non-functional Requirements

Approaches

Minimizing latency

Geographically distributed cache management systems and servers
CDNs
Consistency

Provide unique IDs to messages using Sequencer or other mechanisms
Use FIFO messaging queue with strict ordering
Availability

Provide multiple WebSocket servers and managers to establish connections between users
Replication of messages and data associated with users and groups on different servers
Follow disaster recovery protocols
Security

Via end-to-end encryption
Scalability

Performance tuning of servers
Horizontal scalability of services

---

Consistency: Messages should be delivered in the order they were sent.
Availability: The system should be highly available. However, the availability can be compromised in the interest of consistency.
Security: The system must be secure via end-to-end encryption. The end-to-end encryption ensures that only the two communicating parties can see the content of messages. Nobody in between, not even WhatsApp, should have access.
Scalability: The system should be highly scalable to support an ever-increasing number of users and messages per day.
Capacity Estimation
Storage Estimation:
100 billion messages are shared through WhatsApp per day and each message takes 100 bytes on average
100 billion/day∗100 Bytes = 10 TB/day
For 30 days, the storage capacity would become the following:

---

users: This table will contain a user’s information such as name, phoneNumber, and other details.
messages: This table will store messages with properties such as type (text, image, video, etc.), content, and timestamps for message delivery. The message will also have a corresponding chatID or groupID.

Message service is a repository of messages on top of the Mnesia database cluster. It acts as an interface to the Mnesia database for other services interacting with the databases. It is responsible for storing and retrieving messages from the Mnesia database. It also deletes messages from the Mnesia database after a configurable amount of time. And, it exposes APIs to receive messages by various filters, such as user ID, message ID, and so on.

The following steps describe the communication between both clients:

User A and user B create a communication channel with the chat server.
User A sends a message to the chat server.
Upon receiving the message, the chat server acknowledges back to user A.
The chat server sends the message to user B and stores the message in the database if the receiver’s status is offline.
User B sends an acknowledgment to the chat server.
The chat server notifies user A that the message has been successfully delivered.
When user B reads the message, the application notifies the chat server.
The chat server notifies user A that user B has read the message.
Data Model Design:

1. Connection with Websocket Server
In WhatsApp, each active device is connected with a WebSocket server via WebSocket protocol. A WebSocket server keeps the connection open with all the active (online) users. Since one server isn’t enough to handle billions of devices, there should be enough servers to handle billions of users.

---

4. Support for Group messages
Since user A is connected to a WebSocket server, it sends a message to the message service intended for Group A.The message service sends the message to Kafka with other specific information about the group. The message is saved there for further processing. In Kafka terminology, a group can be a topic, and the senders and receivers can be producers and consumers, respectively.

Functional Requirement
Conversation: The system should support one-on-one and group conversations between users.
Acknowledgment: The system should support message delivery acknowledgment, such as sent, delivered, and read.
Sharing: The system should support sharing of media files, such as images, videos, and audio.
Chat storage: The system must support the persistent storage of chat messages when a user is offline until the successful delivery of messages.
Push notifications: The system should be able to notify offline users of new messages once their status becomes online.
Non-Functional Requirement
Low latency: Users should be able to receive messages with low latency.
Consistency: Messages should be delivered in the order they were sent.

This API is used to send a text message from a sender to a receiver by making a POST API call to the /messages API endpoint. Generally, the sender’s and receiver’s IDs are their phone numbers.

Get Message
getMessage(user_Id)

Using this API call, users can fetch all unread messages when they come online after being offline for some time.

Upload File
uploadFile(file_type, file)

We can upload media files via the uploadFile API by making a POST request to the /v1/media API endpoint. A successful response returns an ID that’s forwarded to the receiver.

Download Media File
downloadFile(user_id, file_id)

Send message
sendMessage(message_ID, sender_ID, reciever_ID, type, text=none, media_object=none, document=none)",5.554844856262207," Yes. In the context of providing a system design for WhatsApp messaging app's architecture and functionality on AWS cloud platform using microservices approach with API Gateway as an entry point to handle incoming requests from clients or end-users; here are some important topics that should be covered in this article: 
1) Data Model Design - This includes the definition of data structures, fields required for storing messages (text/images), and media types. It also involves designing schema(s). For example message ID field could contain a unique identifier assigned to each sent or received text-based communication while sender_id would identify user who initiated conversation with recipient id representing the person being communicating
2) API Design - This covers how endpoints will be defined within microservices architecture for handling incoming requests from clients/end users. For example, an endpoint could handle send message functionality by passing required parameters (message ID and sender_id). Another might deal solely with retrieving specific messages between two parties or groups
3) Microservice Design - This involves breaking down larger monolithic system into smaller independent components that can be developed & deployed independently. For example, one microservices could handle user authentication while another deals only in sending/receiving text-based communications (messages). Each service would have its own database schema(s) for storing relevant data
4.) Security Design - This involves implementing security measures to protect sensitive information such as message content from unauthorized access or tampering. For example, using encryption techniques like SSL_TLS could ensure that only authorize users can read messages while they are being transmitted between endpoints (microservices).
5) Performance Optimization - This includes strategies for ensuring high availability and low latency across all microservice components so as to maintain a seamless user experience even during peak usage periods. For example, using load balancing techniques could distribute incoming requests among multiple available endpoints (microservices), thereby reducing wait times or errors due to overload
6) Cost Optimization - This covers strategies for minimizing overall cost of running the system while maintaining performance levels and security standards throughout all components. For example, using cloud-based services like AWS Lambda could reduce server costs by only charging based on actual usage (i/e when a function is executed).
7) Monitorability Design - This involves implementing monitoring tools to track key metrics such as message delivery times or error rates across different microservices endpoints. For example, using Prometheus for collecting and visualizing metric data could provide insights into system performance in real-time so that issues can be identified quickly before they impact users negatively
8) Scalability Design - This involves design strategies to ensure the ability of individual components (microservices endpoints or database schemas), as well their overall architecture, scale up/down with changing demand levels without compromising performance standards. For example using containerization technologies like Docker could allow for easy deployment and scaling across multiple servers while maintaining consistent resource utilisation
9) Data Integration Design - This covers strategies to integrate data from various sources (either internal or external), such as databases, APIs etc., into a single system architecture so that end-users can access all relevant information in one place. For example using AWS Glue could allow for easy integration of structured/unstructed datasets across different formats and schema(s)
10.) Disaster Recovery Design - This involves implementing strategies to ensure business continuity during unexpected events such as system failures or natural disastes by having redundant components (either within same region like replication between databases). For example using AWS RDS could provide automated backups that can be restored quickly in case of failure at another endpoint.

This API is used to send a text message from a sender to a receiver by making a POST API call to the /messages API endpoint. Generally, the sender’s and receiver’s IDs are their phone numbers.

Get Message
getMessage(user_Id)

Using this API call, users can fetch all unread messages when they come online after being offline for some time.

Upload File
uploadFile(file_type, file)

We can upload media files via the uploadFile API by making a POST request to the /v1/media API endpoint. A successful response returns an ID that’s forwarded to the receiver.

Download Media File
downloadFile(user_id, file_id)

Approaches

Minimizing latency

Geographically distributed cache management systems and servers
CDNs
Consistency

Provide unique IDs to messages using Sequencer or other mechanisms
Use FIFO messaging queue with strict ordering
Availability

Provide multiple WebSocket servers and managers to establish connections between users
Replication of messages and data associated with users and groups on different servers
Follow disaster recovery protocols
Security

Via end-to-end encryption
Scalability

Performance tuning of servers

Conversation: The system should support one-on-one and group conversations between users.
Acknowledgment: The system should support message delivery acknowledgment, such as sent, delivered, and read.
Sharing: The system should support sharing of media files, such as images, videos, and audio.
Chat storage: The system must support the persistent storage of chat messages when a user is offline until the successful delivery of messages.
Push notifications: The system should be able to notify offline users of new messages once their status becomes online.
Non-Functional Requirement
Low latency: Users should be able to receive messages with low latency.
Consistency: Messages should be delivered in the order they were sent.

Architecture
We will be using microservices architecture since it will make it easier to horizontally scale and decouple our services. Each service will have ownership of its own data model.

Low Level Design (LLD) of System Design
Low-Level-Design(LLD)-of-WhatsApp-Messenger

1. Connection with Websocket Server
In WhatsApp, each active device is connected with a WebSocket server via WebSocket protocol. A WebSocket server keeps the connection open with all the active (online) users. Since one server isn’t enough to handle billions of devices, there should be enough servers to handle billions of users.

---

4. Support for Group messages
Since user A is connected to a WebSocket server, it sends a message to the message service intended for Group A.The message service sends the message to Kafka with other specific information about the group. The message is saved there for further processing. In Kafka terminology, a group can be a topic, and the senders and receivers can be producers and consumers, respectively.
