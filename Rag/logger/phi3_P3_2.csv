Image 6:  The image appears to be a flowchart or diagram illustrating the architecture of a system that involves a database, web interface, and machine learning processes. Here's a summary of the key components as depicted:

**5.1.1 System Context**

Image 1:  The image appears to be a conceptual or architectural diagram of a computer network, possibly for educational or illustrative purposes. It shows various components connected by lines indicating the flow of information or data transfer between them.

Here are the key components as summarized:

---

5. **User Interface**: This component represents the point at which users interact with the system. It could be through a web interface, command-line interface, or another user-facing application.

6. **Data Output**: The output where processed data is presented or made available to users or other systems. This might be in the form of reports, dashboards, or direct data access.

Image 7:  The image displays a flowchart or diagram with various elements that represent a software architecture. It outlines the structure of an application, showing how different components interact and contribute to its functionality. Here's a summary of the key components as depicted in the diagram:

table. An Invalid Relationship Exception might happen if the relationships were
incorrectly set at creation, were not properly updated to reflect changes made to the system,
or were not removed fully upon deletion.

---

address the core quality attributes. This will be followed up by a look at a couple views into
the system. Finally, acknowledgements, references, and appendices will round out the
document.

---

If the communications are taking place between the server and an external API, then data will
be transferred as a serializable Java object.

---

This tactic is often utilized with client­server configurations, as the downtime of systems using
this tactic is usually only milliseconds. Active Redundancy must be used with State
_Resynchronization, as the component being restored must have its state upgraded before it is_
returned to service. The state of this component is synchronized using a single message
containing the state that it must be returned to.

---

3. **Access Layer**: This layer is responsible for controlling access to the system. It likely involves authentication and authorization checks before allowing users or systems to proceed with their tasks.

4. **Data Store**: A repository where processed data is stored. The diagram suggests that data is saved in some form of structured storage, possibly a database or file system.

---

3. **Mail Server** - There is a server with the label ""MAIL SERVER,"" which implies it's responsible for sending and receiving emails within this network.

4. **Database System** - The diagram includes a database system, as indicated by the label ""SQL Database."" This likely stores data that can be accessed or manipulated using Structured Query Language (SQL).

---

6. **Service**: There's an arrow pointing from the database to a service labeled ""Tomcat,"" which might represent an application server handling requests from the web interface or other services.
7. **Machine Learning Service**: This suggests that there is a separate service dedicated to machine learning tasks, possibly interacting with the main service or directly with the database.

---

1. **Client**: This represents the user who interacts with the system via a web interface.
2. **Web Interface**: The entry point for users to interact with the system. It includes a form for inputting data and possibly other functionality not clearly labeled in the image.
3. **Server**: This likely refers to the server-side processing that receives requests from the client and manages various operations, including the handling of forms and the execution of machine learning processes.

---

7. **Networking Devices** - There are three networking devices represented by icons: a router, a switch, and another server with the label ""COOP_SERVER."" The presence of these devices suggests a network setup that allows for communication between different parts of the system.

Client
A client is a component that invokes services of a server component. Clients have ports that
describe the services they require. In the context of the Co­op Evaluation System, the client is
a web browser being used to access the system. The client makes HTTP requests using
RESTful web services.",27.10891318321228," Response: No
