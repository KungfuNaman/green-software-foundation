      "question": "Describe cache static data in a specialised perspective and give examples of usage scenarios and associated content to illustrate why.",
      "answer": "Caching static data involves storing non-changing data, like images or configuration files, in a temporary storage to reduce repeated access to the main database or server. This practice minimizes resource consumption and speeds up data retrieval. For example, a website could cache logo images and stylesheets, significantly improving load times and reducing server load."

      "question": "Describe content delivery networks in a specialised perspective and give examples of usage scenarios and associated content to illustrate why.",
      "answer": "Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) are systems of distributed servers that deliver web content based on the geographic location of the user. CDNs enhance the speed and performance of web services by caching content closer to the user, reducing latency and server load. For instance, a global e-commerce platform can use a CDN to ensure that product images and videos load quickly regardless of the user's location, improving user experience and reducing data transfer costs."

      "question": "Describe browser caching in a specialised perspective and give examples of usage scenarios and associated content to illustrate why.",
      "answer": "Browser caching stores web assets locally on the user's device, allowing the browser to reuse them for subsequent visits without re-fetching from the server. This reduces server requests and load times, leading to a faster user experience. For example, a news website can cache its CSS files and frequently used images, so returning visitors experience quicker load times and reduced data usage."

    {
      "question": "Describe edge caching strategies in a specialised perspective and give examples of usage scenarios and associated content to illustrate why.",
      "answer": "Edge caching strategies involve storing content closer to the end users at the network edge, reducing latency and bandwidth usage. By placing caches at strategic points, content delivery is faster and more efficient. For example, streaming services use edge caching to deliver high-definition videos smoothly to users worldwide, reducing the load on central servers and improving playback quality."

      "question": "Describe choosing the region that is closest to users in a specialised perspective and give examples of usage scenarios and associated content to illustrate why.",
      "answer": "Choosing the region closest to users involves deploying servers and services in geographic locations near the majority of the user base to minimize latency and improve performance. This practice ensures faster data access and enhances user experience. For example, a cloud service provider might deploy resources in multiple global regions, ensuring that a user in Asia accesses data from a nearby server rather than one in North America, significantly reducing load times and improving responsiveness."

    {
      "question": "Describe geo-IP routing in a specialised perspective and give examples of usage scenarios and associated content to illustrate why.",
      "answer": "Geo-IP routing directs user traffic to servers based on their geographical location, utilizing the user's IP address to determine the nearest server. This practice reduces latency and improves load times by serving content from the closest possible location. For example, an international e-commerce website can use geo-IP routing to ensure customers in Europe are directed to servers in Europe, providing a faster and more reliable shopping experience."

    {
      "question": "Describe dynamic content delivery optimization in a specialised perspective and give examples of usage scenarios and associated content to illustrate why.",
      "answer": "Dynamic content delivery optimization involves techniques to enhance the delivery of dynamically generated content, which is not cacheable, by optimizing server-side processing and network paths. This practice ensures efficient resource use and faster response times. For instance, a real-time stock trading platform can optimize dynamic content delivery by using edge computing and intelligent load balancing to provide users with up-to-the-second data and quick transaction capabilities."
