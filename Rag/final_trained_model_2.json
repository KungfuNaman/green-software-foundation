          "When the user loads the Netflix app on his\/her device firstly AWS instances come into the picture and\nhandle some tasks such as login, recommendations, search, user history, the home page, billing,\ncustomer support, etc.\nAfter that, when the user hits the play button on a video, Netflix analyzes the network speed or connection\nstability, and then it figures out the best Open Connect server near to the user.\nDepending on the device and screen size, the right video format is streamed into the user\u2019s device. While\nwatching a video, you might have noticed that the video appears pixelated and snaps back to HD after a\nwhile.\nThis happens because the application keeps checking the best streaming open connect server and\nswitches between formats (for the best viewing experience) when it\u2019s needed.",
