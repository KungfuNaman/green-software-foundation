Since one server isn\u2019t enough to handle billions of devices, there should be enough servers to handle billions of users.\n\n---\n\nFunctional Requirement\nConversation: The system should support one-on-one and group conversations between users.\nAcknowledgment: The system should support message delivery acknowledgment, such as sent, delivered, and read.\nSharing: The system should support sharing of media files, such as images, videos, and audio.\nChat storage: The system must support the persistent storage of chat messages when a user is offline until the successful delivery of messages.\nPush notifications: The system should be able to notify offline users of new messages once their status becomes online.\nNon-Functional Requirement\nLow latency: Users should be able to receive messages with low latency.\nConsistency: Messages should be delivered in the order they were sent.\n\n---\n\nFor 30 days, the storage capacity would become the following:\n30\u221710 TB/day = 300 TB/month\n\n---\n\nAPI Design\nSend message\nsendMessage(message_ID, sender_ID, reciever_ID, type, text=none, media_object=none, document=none)\n\n---\n\nThe following steps describe the communication between both clients:\n\nUser A and user B create a communication channel with the chat server.\nUser A sends a message to the chat server.\nUpon receiving the message, the chat server acknowledges back to user A.\nThe chat server sends the message to user B and stores the message in the database if the receiver\u2019s status is offline.\nUser B sends an acknowledgment to the chat server.\nThe chat server notifies user A that the message has been successfully delivered.\nWhen user B reads the message, the application notifies the chat server.\nThe chat server notifies user A that user B has read the message.\nData Model Design:\nData-Model-Design"

The client communicates with the cloud storage for any action performed in the files/folders using the API provided by the cloud provider.\n\n---\n\n3.8. Downloading Services:\nClients initiate file download requests through the client application. The Download Service queries the Metadata Database for file details. The server\u2019s Download Service retrieves metadata from the Metadata Database. Metadata includes information such as file name, size, owner, and access permissions.\n\n4. Low-Level Design(LLD) of Dropbox System Design\nA lot of people assume designing a Dropbox is that all they just need to do is to use some cloud services, upload the file, and download the file whenever they want but that\u2019s not how it works. The core problem is \u201cWhere and how to save the files? \u201c. Suppose you want to share a file that can be of any size (small or big) and you upload it into the cloud.\n\n---\n\nCache Sharding\nSimilar to Metadata DB Sharding, we are distributing the cache to multiple servers. In-fact Redis has out of box support for partitioning the data across multiple Redis instances. Usage of Consistent Hashing for distributing data across instances ensures that load is equally distributed if one instance goes away.\n8. Conclusion\nIn conclusion, the design of the Dropbox system incorporates a well-thought-out architecture that seamlessly handles user file uploads, downloads, metadata management, and storage using a set of key components.\n\n---\n\nMore bandwidth and cloud space utilization:\nTo provide a history of the files you need to keep multiple versions of the files.\nThis requires more bandwidth and more space in the cloud. Even for the small changes in your file, you will have to back up and transfer the whole file into the cloud again and again which is not a good idea.\nLatency or Concurrency Utilization:\nYou can\u2019t do time optimization as well. It will consume more time to upload a single file as a whole even if you make small changes in your file.\nIt\u2019s also not possible to make use of concurrency to upload/download the files using multi threads or multi processes.\nLet\u2019s discuss how we can solve this problem:\ndesign-dropbox-1\n\n---\n\nNow let\u2019s talk about the various components for the complete low level design solution of the Dropbox."

However, there's a twist: if 'y' has any prime numbers between -5 and +5 (inclusive), those specific combinations with corresponding powers are not allowed.\n\nTo make the problem more interesting, we want to incorporate additional constraints on `p`. Let\u2019s say that in addition to it being an odd number less than 10, if 'x' is also a square of any integer (such as x = 4 or x=9), then only those combinations where `(n*mod(p))==2` are allowed.\n\nLastly, we need the function not just to create this dictionary but print it in an organized manner. Here\u2019s how: For each key-value pair (combination of `x`, and corresponding list), your program should first check whether 'y' is a prime number or satisfies certain conditions that result from our constraints on 'p'. If either case applies, the function must exclude those combinations entirely.\n\nFinally, ensure all permutations are unique for each valid `(x, y)` combination. So if `z = x**(n/10)` gives two same results due to different n values but with permissible pairs of (x,y), keep only one instance in the final dictionary.\n\nYour solution should demonstrate advanced understanding and mastery over conditional logic programming concepts like loops, conditionals for handling constraints on 'p' related issues along with permutation generation while avoiding duplicates. The resulting program must also be efficient enough to handle this combinatorial problem without exceedingly long execution times or memory use.\n\nYou can start by defining the function that takes `x`,`y`, and then implement these additional rules in your solution:\n```python\ndef create_combinations(n, p):\n    # Your code here to return a dictionary with required properties as per instructions above. \n# Function signature example provided.\nprint(create_combinations())  # This should print the final organized and unique combination results according to given constraints.\n```",

We calculate the distance between the actual location and all the pickup and drop-off points used by drivers.\n\n---\n\nThen how does Uber tackle the data center failure?? \n\nIt actually uses driver phones as a source of trip data to tackle the problem of data center failure. \nWhen The driver\u2019s phone app communicates with the dispatch system or the API call is happening between them, the dispatch system sends the encrypted state digest (to keep track of the latest information/data) to the driver\u2019s phone app.\nEvery time this state digest will be received by the driver\u2019s phone app. In case of a data center failure, the backup data center (backup DISCO) doesn\u2019t know anything about the trip so it will ask for the state digest from the driver\u2019s phone app and it will update itself with the state digest information received by the driver\u2019s phone app. Untitled Diagram\n\n---\n\nKafka takes historical data along with real-time data.

When supply receives the request from demand the location gets updated using the cell ID as a shard key.\nThese tiny cells\u2019 responsibilities will be divided into different servers lies in multiple regions (consistent hashing).\nFor example, we can allocate the responsibility of 12 tiny cells to 6 different servers (2 cells for each server) lying in 6 different regions. \ncell distribution among nodes\n\n---\n\nThen how does Uber tackle the data center failure?? \n\nIt actually uses driver phones as a source of trip data to tackle the problem of data center failure. \nWhen The driver\u2019s phone app communicates with the dispatch system or the API call is happening between them, the dispatch system sends the encrypted state digest (to keep track of the latest information/data) to the driver\u2019s phone app.\nEvery time this state digest will be received by the driver\u2019s phone app. In case of a data center failure, the backup data center (backup DISCO) doesn\u2019t know anything about the trip so it will ask for the state digest from the driver\u2019s phone app and it will update itself with the state digest information received by the driver\u2019s phone app. Untitled Diagram"

Here we use Apache Kafka as the data hub.\nOnce the latest location is updated by Kafka it slowly passes through the respective worker notes\u2019 main memory.\nAlso, a copy of the location (state machine/latest location of cabs) will be sent to the database and to the dispatch optimization to keep the latest location updated.\n\n---\n\nIt maintains consistent hashing to assign the work across the workers.
