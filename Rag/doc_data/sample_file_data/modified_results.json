However, there's a twist: if 'y' has any prime numbers between -5 and +5 (inclusive), those specific combinations with corresponding powers are not allowed.\n\nTo make the problem more interesting, we want to incorporate additional constraints on `p`. Let\u2019s say that in addition to it being an odd number less than 10, if 'x' is also a square of any integer (such as x = 4 or x=9), then only those combinations where `(n*mod(p))==2` are allowed.\n\nLastly, we need the function not just to create this dictionary but print it in an organized manner. Here\u2019s how: For each key-value pair (combination of `x`, and corresponding list), your program should first check whether 'y' is a prime number or satisfies certain conditions that result from our constraints on 'p'. If either case applies, the function must exclude those combinations entirely.\n\nFinally, ensure all permutations are unique for each valid `(x, y)` combination. So if `z = x**(n/10)` gives two same results due to different n values but with permissible pairs of (x,y), keep only one instance in the final dictionary.\n\nYour solution should demonstrate advanced understanding and mastery over conditional logic programming concepts like loops, conditionals for handling constraints on 'p' related issues along with permutation generation while avoiding duplicates. The resulting program must also be efficient enough to handle this combinatorial problem without exceedingly long execution times or memory use.\n\nYou can start by defining the function that takes `x`,`y`, and then implement these additional rules in your solution:\n```python\ndef create_combinations(n, p):\n    # Your code here to return a dictionary with required properties as per instructions above. \n# Function signature example provided.\nprint(create_combinations())  # This should print the final organized and unique combination results according to given constraints.\n```",
